<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Rick Nelson</h4>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/sanguinic_1512658909_parlour.jpg"></div>
<p>First things first: this is <em>not</em> one of those Best-Burgers-in-the-Twin Cities lists. </p>
<p>Fans of the <a href="http://boroughmpls.com/parlour/">Parlour</a> burger (pictured above) or the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-restoring-the-fabled-diner-tradition-at-revival/302218701/">Revival </a>burger, or the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-butcher-shop-bliss-at-lowry-hill-meats/383436961/">Lowry Hill Meats</a> burger, or the <a href="http://www.crnook.com">Nook</a> burger. I’m with you. They’re all the greatest. But because they weren’t featured in this year’s Burger Friday blog – which shines the spotlight on gotta-try Twin Cities burgers – they’re not included here.</p>
<p>Instead, I’ve revisited 2017’s 30-plus Burger Friday installments, and selected the five that really stand out. </p>
<p>Notice that four out of five burgers share a single trait. That commonality is no coincidence, and it underscores one major reason why the Twin Cities continues to cultivate such a remarkable dining scene; it’s because metro-area chefs have easy access to top-flight ingredients from a remarkable (and continually expanding) community of farmers. Here are the five: </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-walker-art-center-s-new-restaurant-turns-cheeseburger-into-high-art/409903605/">ESKER GROVE</a></strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/sanguinic_1512658959_esker.jpg"></div>
<p><strong>The burger:</strong> When the Walker Art Center debuted its <a href="http://video.startribune.com/the-walker-s-new-restaurant-esker-grove-combines-art-with-dining/407794036/">gorgeous new restaurant</a> last December, chefs Doug Flicker and T.J. Rawitzer included a (sorry for this) <em>museum-quality</em> burger on the menu. It starts with a doozy of a bun, baked on the premises and enriched with milk. The patty? An all-chuck formula (sourced from <a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-where-s-the-limousin-beef-in-osceola-wis/394502971/"><u>Peterson Craftsman Meats</u></a>, the pride of Osceola, Wis.) that gets an overnight cure before it’s fortified with butter, formed into thick-ish patties and nurtured in its own juices on the flat top grill to an ideal medium, bordering on medium-well. Cheese is appropriately salty American (two extravagant slices), and the pickles are superb. Finishing touches? A pair of sauces. It’s an instant classic.<br><strong>Price:</strong> $12, a more-than-suitable amount, one that, given the level of quality, verges into <em>deal</em> territory. <br><strong>Fries</strong>: None. Instead, it’s paper-thin, house-made potato chips.<br><strong>Address book:</strong> 723 Vineland Place, Mpls., 612-375-7542. Lunch 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, dinner 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 5 to 9 p.m. Sunday. Note: Esker Grove’s burger is a lunch-only item.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/at-cafe-alma-in-minneapolis-a-stellar-burger-that-s-17-years-in-the-making/412704493/">CAFE ALMA</a></strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/sanguinic_1512658992_alma.JPG"></div>
<p><strong>The burger:</strong> Chef Matt Sprague keeps burger fans happy with turkey burgers and lamb burgers, both on his daytime menu. On Thursday evenings, he channels his considerable burger-making talents in a more traditional direction – beef – and the results are spectacular. Sprague adheres to the popular double-patty formula, but not blindly; the sirloin-heavy patties are noticeably weightier than their counterparts on the diner-style skinny-patty spectrum (“Sometimes, when patties are smashed super-thin, they tend to dry out,” said Sprague). Condiments squarely land in the “restrained” camp, which keeps this quality beef (from Peterson Craft Meats) at the forefront: shredded iceberg lettuce, house-made bread-and-butter pickles that own the “right-on-the-money” label, a few slices of American cheese (with backbone-strengthening boosts from a smoky Gouda and a funky blue cheese), and a Russian dressing-like sauce that brazenly cranks up the umami quotient. The toasty, buttered-up brioche bun, baked on the premises, is nothing short of perfect.<br><strong>Price:</strong> $12. A bargain, especially considering the favorable potato situation (see Fries, below). <br><strong>Fries: </strong>None. Instead, the Alma Double is served with the kitchen’s epic “Crispy Smashed Russet Potatoes,” and they’re so good that you ought to do yourself a favor and add a side order ($8); you’ll thank me. <br><strong>Address book:</strong> 528 University Av. SE., Mpls., 612-379-4909. The Alma Double is served in the cafe on Thursday evenings only, after 5 p.m. The cafe is open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday.</p>

<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/sanguinic_1512659030_mercy.JPG"></div>
<p><strong>The burger:</strong> This single-patty beauty just might play a role in turning the tide on the popularity of the double-patty burger. The beef is exceptional: an in-house grind that’s a Gold Card mix of Niman Ranch prime chuck and brisket, fortified by trimmings from the menu’s tenderloin, New York strip and sirloin steaks. Uncomplicated garnishes (including a heaping handful of shredded lettuce, a ketchup-free sauce that adds zing but doesn’t overwhelm, and enough thin-sliced, vinegary pickles to nearly constitute a salad) ring true to its “Old School Cheeseburger” name, and the buttery, challah-style bun (baked at Turtle Bread Co.) is first-rate. As for the cheese, it’s Gouda, a welcome departure from the American-draped burgers that are all the rage.<br><strong>Price:</strong> $14 during the day, $15 at dinner, and justified (see Niman Ranch, above). Drop in during happy hour(s) – that’s 3 to 6 p.m. daily – when Rakun shaves the price to 12 bucks.<br><strong>Fries:</strong> None. Instead, a generous handful of house-made potato chips.<br><strong>Address book:</strong> 901 Hennepin Av. S., Mpls., 612-252-7000. Open 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Burger served during brunch (11 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekends), lunch (11 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays) and dinner (3 to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 3 to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-a-meatloaf-patty-melt-lights-up-the-north-loop-s-fulton-brewery/456650313/">FULTON BREWING CO.</a></strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/sanguinic_1512659067_fulton.jpg"></div>
<p><strong>The burger:</strong> This sort-of burger places a Hall of Fame-level Minneapolis dish at its center: the meatloaf from the late and highly lamented <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-end-of-a-modern-cafe-era/295997901/">Modern Cafe</a>. Chef Scott Pampuch enriches the beef (big surprise, it’s from Peterson) with the menu’s excellent porchetta, which is ground and blended into the ground beef in a 1-to-4 ratio. Pampuch treats the notably rich beef-pork mix like any burger, portioning it into hefty 6-ounce balls and carefully formed into a patty (one that’s big enough to stretch to the bread’s edges, a key trait) just before it hits the charbroiler. Shout-outs to the brewery abound. The bread is grilled in butter that’s blended with Jameson whiskey, a key ingredient in the brewery’s “<a href="http://www.fultonbeer.com/beer/war-and-peace#">War and Peace</a>,” a dark-roast coffee stout. Butter-sauteed mushrooms get a finishing touch with that stout when it deglazes the pan. (By the way, that bread is the superb <a href="https://bakersfieldflour.com/">Baker’s Field</a> <em>pain de mie</em>, a soft Pullman loaf that’s sliced thick and toasted to a dark, dark brown). Other wisely chosen condiments include a pair of Swiss cheese slices, along with an equal-parts combo of mayo and ketchup that Pampuch jazzes with a pinch of Old Bay seasoning. Truly, this is a patty melt that is not to be missed.<br><strong>Price:</strong> $13. Pair the burger with the brewery’s “War and Peace,” naturally.<br><strong>Fries:</strong> Not included, but a must ($5). Skinny and golden, they’re liberally tossed in a salt that’s infused with the flavor of the floral- and citrus-scented hops (they’re dehydrated, compressed and finely ground) that the brewery uses for its West Coast IPA. What a great idea.<br><strong>Address book:</strong> 414 6th Av. N., Mpls., 612-333-3208. Taproom open 3 to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 3 to 11 p.m. Friday, noon-11 p.m. Saturday and noon to 6 Sunday.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-a-reimagined-minneapolis-dive-bar-fries-up-a-stunner-of-a-no-frills-cheeseburger/461292653/">BULL’S HORN FOOD &amp; DRINK</a></strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/sanguinic_1512659104_bulls.jpg"></div>
<p><strong>The burger:</strong> This uncomplicated, old-school dive-bar burger is bound to generate some serious chatter up and down Burger Nation. It recalls the most winning attributes of the fast-food burgers of my 1970s childhood. Chef/co-owner Doug Flicker may be cooking in a former 3.2 joint, but he doesn’t stint on quality; yep, he’s sourcing flavorful grass-fed beef from the Peterson folks. “I was shooting for a balance,” he said. “It all kind of comes down to proportions. A good hamburger is a combination of everything, it’s not just the meat. The patty shouldn’t be too thick, so when you take a bite it all blends together: the beef, the bun, the cheese, the lettuce and the sauce. It’s about harmony.” Of course it helps that this is an exceptionally wide patty, meaning that a maximum amount of beef comes into contact with the grill’s heat, unlocking all kinds of tantalizing flavor molecules. The bun is spectacular, a milk-enriched formula from <a href="http://www.startribune.com/burger-friday-talking-with-hamburger-bun-savant-danny-klecko-mcgleno/390699731/">Saint Agnes Baking Co.</a> Cheese is appropriately plentiful, as is the chopped iceberg that’s slipped under the patty. The sauce is straight out of the bar burger’s manifesto, a mix of mayo, ketchup, pickle juice and paprika. Bull’s Horn has only been open since Halloween, and this burger has already emerged as the menu’s top-seller. “By far,” said Flicker.<br><strong>Price:</strong> $8, a deal that that lands squarely in Black Friday territory. Cheese is an extra 50 cents, bacon is an additional $1.<br><strong>Fries:</strong> Extra ($2), and not to be missed, in part because, once again, they skirt close to an idealized McDonald’s French fry: slim, golden, crispy and piping hot, with just the right amount of salt. A basket version is $6.50.<br><strong>Address book:</strong> 4563 34th Av. S., Mpls., 612-208-1378. Open 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.</p>

<p>Their resolve was breathtaking. They were creative, resilient and forward-looking, reaching back, after personal success, to help others rise. “Be kind to all that live,” was the Buddhist creed of one who spent years in a Japanese internment camp. Sculptors, writers, cooks, entertainers and that reliable voice on the radio in the background of a beautiful fall day. They nourished us with food, laughter, music and the examples they set in life. Here are some of the Minnesotans — including one who lived here only on television — we lost this year. Our Northern Lights for 2017. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The latest addition to downtown Excelsior’s charming Water St. community debuted last Friday. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/rsrexcelsior/">Red Sauce Rebellion</a>, a casual counter to Victor’s on Water, the more formal Italian restaurant it replaces, offers a completely remade space and a new, approachable menu at 205 Water St.</p>
<p>The team behind neighborhood restaurant <a href="http://coalitionrestaurant.com/">Coalition</a> made quick work of renovations after taking over the space on Nov. 1, but the major change is obvious. The elegant drop ceiling has been removed, and the space has been opened up significantly. Part of the kitchen is exposed, and a small bar near the back was jazzed up with turquoise tiling and plates decorated by a local artist.</p>
<p>There, cocktails such as the Rebellious Boulevardier – which incorporates port into the typical concoction of whiskey, Campari and vermouth – and other takes on classic drinks, are whipped up alongside pours from a substantial wine, vermouth, port and grappa list. </p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/ajrayno_1514478338_RedSauceRebellionCocktail.jpeg"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the menu is categorized into starters, soups and salads, pasta, rebel pies – that is, cast-iron, biscuit crust pizzas – and a handful of entrees. The nostalgia-aiming “Americanized” dishes include the likes of charred oysters, farro salad, linguine with clams and braised short ribs. Prices hover around the mid to high teens for most dishes. </p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/ajrayno_1514478376_RedSauceRebellionCharredOysters.jpeg"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, the basement area will be transformed into a cocktail bar, called Rebel Lounge. </p>
<p>Red Sauce Rebellion will serve lunch and dinner, opening at 11 a.m. daily and closing at 9 p.m. on Sun. and Mon., 10 p.m. on Tues., Wed. and Thurs. and 11 p.m. on Fri. and Sat. </p>

<p><br> Wells Fargo, in partnership with Rebuilding Together, has recognized four Minneapolis small-business owners through its nationwide commercial-renovation competition: Wells Fargo Works for Small Business.<br> The “Neighborhood Renovation Program” small business contest netted three local finalists who received $10,000 toward facility renovation.<br> The winner is Hope and Healing Counseling Services. Hope received $25,000.</p>
<p>The local firms in the running were: <br> • Wendy’s House of Soul, a deli, and catering company that operates on W. Broadway Avenue in north Minneapolis. Owner Wendy Pucket, known for her “soul on a roll” specialty sandwich, will get a freshly painted exterior, new cooking equipment and counters.<br> • Marques Armstrong, a veteran mental health practitioner and his Hope and Healing Counseling Services of Minneapolis. Hope serves inner-city communities of color. Armstrong’s two-office practice will expand into three new therapy rooms, thanks to the Wells Fargo grant.<br> • Mridi Warfa and his Ibrahim Restaurant on E. Lake Street will get new chairs and kitchen equipment for a restaurant that serves healthy food and is a community gathering space.<br> • Ian Silver-Ramp, who studied agriculture at the University of Minnesota, operates Mississippi Mushrooms, on the river in north Minneapolis.<br>  </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Natalie Sellman with her daughters, Kailah Jefferson, 17, and Jaida Groomes, 9. As a girl, Maryland medical assistant Natalie Sellman was told that laughing loudly and making jokes wasn’t ladylike.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Laurie Menser was a 7- or 8-year-old in Rockville, Md., when she wandered over to a neighbor’s house one day, slipped a glass eye in her mouth and got the attention of the grown-ups in the room. She smacked the back of her head, stuck out her tongue and waited for laughs. </p>
<p>She’s still waiting. </p>
<p>“They were appalled,” she said. “They were like, ‘You need to go home right now and tell your dad what you did.’ ” </p>
<p>The neighbors didn’t know that it was Menser’s father who’d picked up the fake eye at a yard sale and taught his daughter the gag. Don’t worry, he told her, “they just don’t get the joke.” </p>
<p>Looking back, Menser wonders how the episode might have gone had one element been different: What if she were a boy? “I think probably the neighbor would have told the little boy, ‘Hey, that’s gross and weird and don’t do that anymore,’ ” she said. “Whereas I got, ‘This is appalling.’ ” </p>
<p>Menser, 38, is a director of development at a science association. She has scaled the corporate ladder and is respected in her field. And she thinks that more than anything, her success has been driven by her sense of humor. </p>
<p>She just had to ignore all the voices telling her not to use it. </p>
<p>“There was an expectation that girls would be quieter. And wouldn’t ruin their dresses and wouldn’t be roughhousing and cracking jokes in church,” she said. “And I was very often doing a lot of those things,” thanks in part to her father’s encouragement to let her be what she was: funny. </p>
<p>Today we encourage our daughters to be ambitious and athletic, opinionated and outspoken. We want them focused on STEM and outfitted in T-shirts that read, “Who runs the world? Girls.” </p>
<p>But what if raising empowered girls also means raising funny ones? What if we teach our daughters humor is their turf — just as much as any boy’s? </p>
<p>“One of the things that happens to girls is that they are encroached upon by the world,” said Lisa Damour, a psychologist and author of “Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions Into Adulthood.” </p>
<p>“And one of the things that humor can do is … help girls stand up for themselves in ways that people don’t retaliate for.” </p>
<h3>Humor as a tool </h3>
<p>There’s an abundance of research on the social advantages that come with a strong sense of humor. Humor conveys intelligence. Funny people are seen as more confident and competent. The ability to crack a joke shows social ease and can turn awkward silence into a golden moment of human connection. </p>
<p>“It can actually shift perspective of status — and by status what we mean is respect, influence and admiration,” said T. Bradford Bitterly, co-author of a Wharton business school study on the use of humor in professional settings. </p>
<p>Humor isn’t alien to girls. Caroline Nugent remembers asking her father why people were always laughing at things she said. “It’s called wit,” he told her. </p>
<p>Nugent is 13, smart, self-aware and so enamored of Tina Fey that she spent two weeks at a Second City comedy camp. </p>
<p>Still, these days she isn’t that comfortable cracking jokes around boys or adults she doesn’t know well. </p>
<p>“I feel like when boys make jokes that are edgy, they get more praise for it, but since women are stereotypically dainty and quiet, especially in the past, they aren’t as encouraged to be funny,” she said. </p>
<p>Women’s potential for making jokes is equal to that of men, said Peter McGraw, director of the Humor Research Lab at the University of Colorado. </p>
<p>“When you actually measure a woman and a man’s ability to be funny in the laboratory, you create an even playing field — you remove the social pressures,” he said. “Women are just as good at this stuff as men are.” </p>
<p>But when Robert Provine, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, camped out at food courts and campus quads documenting instances of laughter, he found that men got the most laughs. </p>
<p>“Both men and women are more likely to laugh if a male is talking to them,” said Provine, author of “Laughter: A Scientific Investigation.” </p>
<p>McGraw concluded that there is something societal going on, not biological. </p>
<p>Natalie Sellman has heard stories that as a kid, her mother was a funny girl with a loud laugh. But she has never known her that way. In fact, Natalie’s mom told her that her own mother didn’t approve, often saying: “You laugh like a hyena. Women aren’t supposed to laugh like that.” </p>
<p>Sellman, a 36-year-old medical assistant from District Heights, Md., received some of the same messages. “Do I continue to be who I am?” she remembers wondering. “Or do I slow down just a little bit to fit in with the crowd?” </p>
<p>She piped down. A lot of girls do. But in her case it didn’t feel right. By the end of high school, she didn’t care what people thought anymore. </p>
<p>Today she laughs as loud as she wants and tries to get everyone — including her two daughters and the dozens of patients she sees every day — to do the same. Many of the patients tell her that it helps relieve the tension generated by a visit to the doctor. </p>
<h3>Everybody loses </h3>
<p>McGraw argues that by stunting women out of expressing their humor in mixed company, we’re shortchanging everybody. </p>
<p>“Funny people are better company,” he said. “They make the world an easier, more enjoyable place.” </p>
<p>Gina Barreca, a professor at the University of Connecticut who writes extensively about women and humor, thinks the reason girls often suppress their humor in adolescence is “it’s seen as alpha behavior.” </p>
<p>She added, “Someone holding the mic or getting the last word is not displaying traditional feminine behavior. A good girl doesn’t make anybody uncomfortable. Doesn’t take up too much space.” </p>
<p>But our ideas of “traditional feminine behavior” are always evolving. It wasn’t that long ago that athleticism wasn’t considered feminine. Now we almost require it. </p>
<p>So how does a parent cultivate humor in girls? </p>
<p>“Modeling it,” Damour said. “Being playful. Seeing it as a tool set like any other that can be fostered.” </p>
<p>Praise attempts at humor. Combat messages that diminish it. Encourage our sons to value humor in their girlfriends and girl friends. And their moms. </p>
<p>Recently, Menser’s 8-year-old niece said she liked that Menser is “funny and adventurous.” </p>
<p>“And I said, ‘So are you,’ ” Menser recalled. </p>
<p>“She recognized that that’s something valuable about me, and I want her to know that to me, that’s valuable about her. Because I see that there’s value there. I don’t know that everybody realizes how far being funny can get you, but it helps. It helps a lot in life.” </p>

Max went viral almost a month ago after he was banned from the Macalester College Library with a wanted-like poster.</div>

<p>Max sits on the windowsill of his St. Paul home, staring longingly out at the street he no longer has the freedom to roam. </p>
<p>Since rocketing to viral fame, the orange tabby known for <a href="http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-cat-won-t-stay-out-of-the-library-becomes-internet-sensation/461293973/">frequenting the Macalester College library — and then getting banned from it</a>, Max has become an indoor cat. Paw thing.</p>
<p>He gazes at the street, and late at night he howls — withdrawal symptoms for his addiction to fresh air and musty old books. </p>
<p>But on a recent winter morning, his human, Connie Lipton, took Max out of the house, strapped into a handsome red-and-black harness. She loaded him into her Mazda, with Max perched looking out the rear window, and took him to a nearby bookstore. </p>
<p>Max rose to national prominence last month after a cutesy sign appeared at the Macalester library that warned people not to let him in. Max had previously been spotted on security cameras, roaming the stacks. </p>
<p>More than 200,000 people “liked” <a href="https://twitter.com/e_mcguire_/status/935961091015958531/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startribune.com%2Fst-paul-cat-won-t-stay-out-of-the-library-becomes-internet-sensation%2F461293973%2F">a Twitter post about the library sign</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cool_cat_max_and_gracie/">Max’s own Instagram</a> (managed by Lipton) blew up to 16,500 followers.</p>

          Gallery: Max the Cat takes on the world

<p>It came out that Max was something of a campus celebrity. In addition to the library, he’d been visiting students in the science building, language buildings and dormitories on the other side of campus. He even had a private audience with the Macalester president, which was captured on film, of course. </p>
<p>But a construction project near his house, and an allergic library worker, made Max’s free-range travels no longer feasible. </p>
<p>While not everyone agreed that a cat should have been allowed into any building he desired, one local business made its allegiance known. In the days after Max went famous, Hal Johnson, who owns the Against the Current used-book store, drew “Welcome Max” on the chalkboard outside his Grand Avenue shop. </p>
<p>That’s where Lipton took Max, who was met by an entourage of Macalester groupies who had gotten to know him on his formerly untethered neighborhood outings. </p>
<p>The curious kitty wasted no time making himself at home. He climbed up into the window display, sniffed a book on “Americans From Norway” and nibbled on a lantern. Lipton whipped out a book of her own, “On Cats,” by Doris Lessing, which Max dutifully rubbed his face on. </p>
<p>Macalester student Ming Lian filmed the encounter, and the video will become part of a YouTube series on Max’s visits to Twin Cities bookstores and libraries. Lian, who lives in the French house, knows Max well. “He probably slept in everybody’s bed,” she said. </p>
<p>Lipton hopes the videos will “keep him in the eye of remembrance,” even as Max’s viral fame subsides. She wants to get Max trained as a therapy cat for college students, and eventually turn his following into a movement. </p>
<p>“If this energy keeps moving, I’d like to start a foundation for literacy,” she said. </p>
<p>She’s also had Max consult with an animal communicator, a type of psychic, who is helping him deal with his new indoor status — as well as his newfound fame. </p>
<p>Lipton learned that Max “basically was very excited about doing all these things.” </p>
<p>While Max was indiscriminate with his campus visits, he’s become associated with books thanks to library worker Chris Schommer, who wrote the now renowned sign banning Max (with illustrator Gamze Genc Celik). Schommer signed with an agent following Max’s stardom and is writing a children’s book based on Max’s story. </p>
<p>“Max likes people, and the library is at the crossroads of campus,” said Schommer, who had joined Max on his trip to Against the Current. “He likes that hub of activity.” </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Raegan Willis, 16, a junior and standout swimmer at Minnetonka High School, worked in the classroom with 6-year-old Max Guallpa Naula at the Folwell School in Minneapolis.</div>
                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p>Hundreds of high school students from Minnetonka and Edina are tutoring elementary school pupils — not in the suburbs, but in Minneapolis. </p>
<p>This year more than 500 Minnetonka and Edina High School students have enrolled in the program run by Backpack Tutoring, a nonprofit that aims to help schools close the achievement gap and fight poverty. </p>
<p>“The greatest need is in Minneapolis,” said Bob Davis, the program’s chief executive volunteer. “Minneapolis is leading the achievement gap.” </p>
<p>Backpack Tutoring was started by a Minnetonka student in 1997 for an Eagle Scout project. Davis and his wife, Diana, are now the driving force and have worked to return the program to its student-led roots. </p>
<p>The program runs for 20 weeks from October through March. Minnetonka and Edina School districts cover transportation costs. Tutors clock in 15,000 hours per year, Diana said. The tutors are not paid for their work with the program. But the benefits are ample, she said. The work inspires many to write about their experience in their college application essays while others go on to become teachers. </p>
<p>“This gives them a leadership and volunteer opportunity and exposes them to new and different cultures and communities, with the opportunity to learn and grow in their awareness to issues beyond their own neighborhoods,” Diana said. </p>
<p>The tutors work with kids whose reading or math levels are typically one or sometimes two grades behind their peers. They go to Folwell four days a week after school and two days during regular school hours at Jefferson. Teachers at the schools supervise tutors and provide teaching materials specific to each child. </p>
<p>In addition to tutoring, the students recruit fellow high schoolers for the program, coordinate logistical needs and even manage the programs. </p>
<p>Julia Luehr, a Minnetonka High School senior from Chanhassen, has spent her high school years tutoring and mentoring several Folwell students. Now she manages volunteers and is responsible for cataloging attendance, but she still makes sure she tutors. The hands-on experience for more than an hour a day, one day a week, for 20 weeks has defined her career path. Luehr said she plans on becoming an engineer or a mathematician and help kids with disabilities. </p>
<p>“This program has taught me a viable lesson about work ethic,” Luehr said. “I love going because I believe every kid deserves a good education. You can see how kids are improving and also you make a personal connection with these young kids.” </p>
<p>Folwell teacher Deborah Martel, who supervises the after-school program, said the relationship the kids have built with the tutors has had a positive impact on their learning. </p>
<p>“They are excited,” Martel said. “They want to come, do the work with the tutors and they like it that they are young and energetic.” </p>
<p>In addition to tutoring, the nonprofit has an annual donation drive to collect winter clothing for children who come to school without the proper gear. For more information on the program, e-mail bdavis@backpacktutoring.org. </p>

<p>A paper sign reading “Victoria” in block letters is posted where a marquee used to shine. Inside the century-old St. Paul building, some of the brick walls are covered by remnants of landscape paintings, and a leaky roof has dappled the plywood floor with water stains. The front window facing University Avenue is patched with duct tape. </p>
<p>Frogtown neighbors have spent a decade discussing the future of the vacant Victoria Theater. They held dozens of community meetings and knocked on doors to come up with their plan: a theater and community gathering place, with an office for the Frogtown radio station and perhaps a small coffee shop. </p>
<p>They need another $2 million, and a lot of work, to turn the decrepit building into a functioning theater — but community members said they are closer than ever to achieving their vision. </p>
<p>St. Paul leaders voted this month to give the project a $200,000 grant and a $412,000 forgivable loan, and the local Hardenbergh Foundation awarded a $150,000 grant, said Julie Adams-Gerth, who was hired a couple of months ago as the first executive director of the Victoria Theater Arts Center, a newly formed nonprofit. </p>
<p>“It was a vote of confidence,” Adams-Gerth said of the city money. “The community sees it moving forward now in a really concrete way.” </p>
<p>The Vic, as neighbors call it, sits on University Avenue facing the Green Line’s Victoria Street station. It was a silent movie theater in its first life. Then came a Prohibition-era stint as a speakeasy and nightclub and after that a decades-long run as a lighting store. About two decades ago, it fell vacant and into disrepair. </p>

<p>“It’s going to be work, but we’re up for it,” Adams-Gerth said as she wandered through the cold, largely empty building that she estimates will open in two years. </p>
<p>It almost suffered a very different fate. </p>
<p>In 2009, the Vic was going to be demolished and replaced with a parking lot. Neighbors fought to protect the building and in 2011 the city designated it a heritage preservation site, saving it from destruction. </p>
<p>“It’s a rare surviving example of silent movie theaters from around that time,” said Aaron Rubenstein, with the nonprofit Historic St. Paul. </p>
<p>In addition to its storied speakeasy past — it was raided for illegally selling alcohol — it is known for a 1927 recording by the house band, the Victoria Cafe Orchestra, that ended up in the Anthology of American Folk Music. That recording was key to securing heritage preservation status, Rubenstein said. </p>
<p>The Land Bank Twin Cities bought the building in 2014 with the intent to sell it to the Victoria Theater Arts Center, Adams-Gerth said. Purchasing the building is one of the next steps before renovation. She does not yet know what the full purchase cost will be. </p>
<p>“It’s probably the most celebrated, waited-for project in the last 10 years in Frogtown,” said Caty Royce, director of the Frogtown Neighborhood Association. The association led the many community meetings where residents developed the plan for a theater and gathering place. </p>
<p>The neighborhood lacks meeting space, Adams-Gerth said. And Royce noted Frogtown doesn’t have a theater the size of the Vic, which is expected to have seating for about 120 people and standing room for more than 300. </p>
<p>“Families in the neighborhood, particularly young folks, are hungering for a place like this,” said MK Nguyen, a Frogtown resident who is on the Victoria Theater Arts Center steering committee. “There’s nothing like art, and art spaces, that can unleash genius and power.” </p>

<p>Taylor Lindeman delivered his family’s most precious Christmas present Monday along a frigid roadside in Chisago City shortly after his pregnant wife, Hannah, said he’d better call an ambulance. </p>
<p>The couple spent Christmas Eve at Taylor Lindeman’s parents’ home in Shafer, Minn., near Taylors Falls. Taylor Lindeman, 29, said his wife had been up and down much of the night with contractions but she wasn’t especially concerned. </p>
<p>Christmas Day started about 7 a.m. when their daughters, Lilly, 5, and Dahlia, 3, began opening their presents. The adults started opening their gifts, but Lindeman said his wife couldn’t get through hers because her contractions grew more frequent and “much more painful.” </p>
<p>They left his parents’ house about 9 a.m. for the 45-minute drive to United Hospital in St. Paul. </p>
<p>“I called United to tell them that we were coming. After that, my wife said that I needed to call an ambulance,” Taylor said. “Her contractions were very, very painful. So I called the ambulance and stayed on the line and then eventually had to stop to have the ambulance find us, because they said if I keep driving they couldn’t continue following me.” </p>
<p>They pulled off Hwy. 8 in a windswept area at the edge of Chisago City and Wyoming. Taylor put the ambulance dispatcher on speaker phone and went around to the passenger side of the vehicle where Hannah, 31, was seated. He stood at the open door. He said it was minus-1 or minus-2 degrees outside with a windchill making it feel like 25-below. </p>

                  Poppy Lindeman, the baby delivered on the side of a road by her father Taylor in Chisago City on Monday.

<p></p>
<p>No passers-by stopped to help, Taylor said. He guessed that it was too cold, and that other drivers had their Christmas destinations in mind. </p>
<p>“While I was on the phone with the dispatcher, her water broke,” Taylor said. </p>
<p>That was 9:18 a.m. </p>
<p>Just two minutes later, out came their daughter Poppy. At 20.5 inches long and 6 pounds, 8 ounces — “She’s our biggest baby yet,” the proud poppa said. </p>
<p>A Lakes Area Police officer arrived a minute or two later and stayed with the Lindemans while they waited a few minutes for the ambulance. Taylor closed the passenger door and cranked up the heat. </p>
<p>The police officer cut a shoelace from Hannah’s boot and tied off the umbilical cord, as instructed by an Allina Health dispatcher. </p>
<p>“The police officer did a really good job. The paramedics did a really good job, too,” Taylor said. </p>
<p>He said both parents were doing well at United Hospital Monday afternoon as they braced for a crush of reporters and photographers. They expect to return to their home in Byron, Minn. sometime Wednesday. </p>
<p>Taylor, who teaches seventh-grade English in the Rochester Public Schools, said the delivery took him and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, by surprise. Hannah’s first delivery took between seven to nine hours, he said. Her second delivery came about three hours after they arrived at the hospital. This one, he said, probably took 60 to 90 minutes. </p>
<p>“We weren’t really expecting today to be the delivery — but obviously she had other plans,” Taylor said of Poppy. </p>

<p>Staff at homeless shelters in the Twin Cities likely will be working round-the-clock shifts by this weekend, when temperatures in the Twin Cities will bottom out in the double digits below zero. </p>
<p>The worst will come Saturday, when the high temperature is forecast to be 6 below. Before that, though, there’s a brief respite. Remember, warm is relative. Wednesday’s high is expected to be 6 degrees above zero; Thursday’s forecast called for 15 and Friday for 3. New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, well, 0 and 1 degree. </p>
<p>So, how do people who have to be outside, either by necessity or circumstance, deal with the cold? </p>
<p>Mail carriers will indeed deliver mail at temperatures of 15 below, said Darla Swanson, communications manager for the U.S. Postal Service. The carriers’ employer reminds them regularly to dress properly, stay dry, keep extra clothing in the vehicle in case they become wet and know the signs and symptoms of cold stress. </p>
<p>The same “safety first” credo applies for workers who are out battling ice buildup on the roads or cutting brush in the extreme cold, said Kevin Gutknecht, communications director for the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). </p>
<p>Crews were working in various locations for MnDOT on Tuesday, Gutknecht said. </p>

<p>Outdoor work in the winter takes longer. That’s just the way it is, and MnDOT is OK with that, he said. Most outdoor work crews are experienced and know when it’s time to take a break to warm up. </p>
<p>“We want to make sure whatever we do, we want to do it safely,” Gutknecht said. </p>
<p>It’s not so easy for people who find themselves homeless in below-zero temperatures. </p>
<p>“Our practice is to try to stay open all day when the temperature is not going to creep above zero,” said Wendy Wiegmann, director of programs at Simpson Housing, which coordinates beds at several shelters in the metro area. </p>
<p>Most shelters close at 9 a.m. and reopen at 5 p.m., but that isn’t realistic when people need a place to be out of the dangerous cold and wind. </p>
<p>“It is definitely taxing to find the staffing, food, resources to keep operating when we normally close,” Wiegmann said. “We managed to stay up all day [Monday] and [Tuesday] for those that are staying at our shelter already.” </p>
<p>People outside by choice also need to heed the cold. </p>
<p>The St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office reported that it received a call at 10:09 p.m. Monday about an overdue hunter in Beatty Township near Cook, Minn. The man had left home about 1:30 p.m., and his family became concerned when he didn’t return. </p>
<p>He was found about 4:20 p.m. Tuesday. His truck had become stuck and he began walking to find help. The man was taken to Cook Hospital suffering from hypothermia, the Sheriff’s Office said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Minneapolis issued a warning Tuesday to keep pets and humans safe during extreme cold spells. </p>
<p>“Everyone should remember: If it’s too cold for them, it’s probably too cold for their pets,” the city said. Anyone who sees an animal outside without shelter should call Minneapolis Animal Care and Control at 612-673-3000. </p>
<p>The city of Minnetonka advised residents about keeping water pipes from freezing. It urged making sure the furnace’s cold-air return is pointed away from water pipes; leaving kitchen and bathroom cabinets open for air circulation, and having someone keep an eye on the house if you’re away. </p>

<p>A house fire in the middle of the night on the Iron Range killed a husband, wife and two of their grandchildren, and left a third grandchild less seriously harmed, authorities said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The blaze in the 200 block of 42nd Street E. in a Hibbing neighborhood broke out shortly after 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Fire Department said. </p>
<p>Fire crews arrived to find one juvenile outside and four other people trapped inside, fire officials said. </p>
<p>The four were pulled from the fire on the south end of town about 15 minutes later and were not breathing. While the two children were resuscitated and hospitalized, the couple died, the Fire Department said. </p>
<p>Authorities later said one of the children died Tuesday and then another not long after at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. </p>
<p>The husband and wife were officially identified Wednesday as Steven Gillitzer, 67, and 63-year-old Patricia Gillitzer. </p>

<p>It was soon after the fire was extinguished that “we learned that this tragedy would strike us close to home,” a department statement read, referring to Steven Gillitzer’s nearly quarter-century as a Hibbing firefighter paramedic until his retirement in 2000. </p>
<p>Some in the department now worked with Gillitzer during his tenure, “adding a level of difficulty to an already devastating situation,” the statement continued. Flags outside the Hibbing fire stations were at half-staff Tuesday afternoon in his memory. </p>
<p>The grandchildren who died were identified as Todd Gillitzer Jr., 9, and Isaiah Adams, 3. Surviving the blaze was Jonathan Gillitzer, 8. </p>
<p>Fire officials have not released a preliminary cause of the blaze, which left the house a total loss. </p>
<p>“The investigation is ongoing amongst the double-digit below-zero temperatures,” a Fire Department statement read. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>WASHINGTON — They were the 13 days that transformed the White House. </p>
<p>Even for an administration that spent most of 2017 throwing off headlines at a dizzying pace, events in the second half of July unfolded at breakneck speed. They encapsulated both the promise and peril of President Donald Trump’s first year in office — and yielded aftershocks that reverberate within the White House even as the calendar turns to 2018. </p>
<p>The two-week span laid bare the splintering of Trump’s relationships with two influential Cabinet members, foreshadowed the reach of the Russia probe into the interior of his orbit; saw the dramatic, last-minute defeat of one of the president’s signature campaign promises and featured a senior staff shake-up that reset the rhythms of this presidency. </p>
<p>Inside the West Wing, the chaotic days between July 19-31 stand as a panicked memory but also one that paved the way for future successes, according to nearly two dozen administration officials, outside advisers and lawmakers. Most of those interviewed for this account spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private events. </p>
<p>For the record, though: “That was the extreme,” said former press secretary Sean Spicer. </p>
<p>A leading driver of the chaos was Anthony Scaramucci, who was hired to be the White House’s communications director on July 21, aiming to usher in a new era at a White House riven by in-fighting, drowning in bad press and struggling to maintain credibility. </p>

<p>But his shockingly brief tenure — some White House aides have taken to calling a short period of time a “Mooch” — underscored the drama that frequently paralyzed the West Wing. Spicer quit in protest. Scaramucci fired one staffer and threatened to push out others as he vowed to cut down on leaks. But many in the White House believed that was a cover for his own agenda. Believing that chief strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had initially blocked his entrance to the White House, Scaramucci moved to oust the pair, culminating in an infamous and vulgar New Yorker interview attacking them. </p>
<p>Scaramucci himself was pushed out the door by another change agent: new Chief of Staff John Kelly. </p>
<p>In a July 28 tweet sent with no warning from Air Force One, Trump announced that he was appointing Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary and a retired four-star general, to the post. As the 140-character bursts reached their phones, a pair of senior aides who been sitting in an idling SUV with Priebus stepped out and left the outgoing chief of staff alone. A new phase of the presidency began. </p>
<p>Kelly’s hire, several advisers said, cut down on internal fights, restored order to the West Wing and laid the groundwork for wins down the road. </p>
<p>“I don’t think you can overestimate the effect of the impact of those (staff) changes and that period,” said Marc Lotter, Vice President Mike Pence’s former spokesman. </p>
<p>But there were limits to his influence, as Kelly made clear he would mount no effort to manage Trump’s no-holds Twitter habit. And Trump, in turn, chafed at Kelly’s handling. </p>
<p>A legislative blow just hours earlier on July 28 had highlighted the administration’s troubled agenda at a time of unified Republican control in Washington. When Arizona Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down ended the Republican attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. </p>
<p>From that bungling rose more discipline and the administration’s first major legislative triumph: the tax cut legislation passed on Dec. 20. The White House would fully support the plan at the start. Trump’s political operation would begin work to sell the tax package in the approaching midterm elections. Trump himself worked behind the scenes, making phone calls to key members and, perhaps more importantly, reined in his public criticism of members of his own party. </p>
<p>But while he stuck to GOP orthodoxy on those domestic matters, Trump has steadfastly declined to adopt conventional approaches on foreign policy, straining decades-long alliances, refusing to condemn authoritarian regimes on human rights abuses and escalating the rhetoric in a nuclear stand-off with North Korea. </p>
<p>That came to a head during a July 20 meeting in the windowless Pentagon room known as “The Tank,” which shined a spotlight on the sharp learning curve that the president faced as he grew into his new job. It also revealed the tensions within the administration between those seasoned in international affairs — including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who reportedly called the president “a moron” afterward — and those eager to pull back from international entanglements. </p>
<p>Six days later, FBI agents, armed with a search warrant, emerged from Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s home in Alexandria, Va. with a trove of material. A new, more dangerous, chapter had begun in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible coordination between the president’s campaign and Russian officials. </p>
<p>Scores of top aides and allies, including Jared Kushner and Trump’s eldest son, Donald Jr., have been questioned by Mueller and congressional investigators. In October, Manafort was charged with money laundering and other financial crimes related to his political consulting work in Ukraine. And on Dec. 1, former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is cooperating with the investigation. </p>
<p>Trump had grown furious at the distraction, fuming to advisers that he had done nothing wrong while railing that it was a conspiracy by Democrats and the so-called “deep state” to delegitimize his presidency. Yet he emerged from the crucible of the 13 days in July with a more organized and less drama-filled White House, as well as lessons learned that would yield legislative victories. </p>
<p>But the president himself remains unchanged. </p>
<p>Impulsive and unconventional, Trump has spent his first year in office casting aside norms and mores. With his Twitter account as his weapon, he has shown no willingness to ignore any slight or change the brash ways that he believes got him elected. </p>
<p>“It’s so easy to act presidential,” Trump told supporters in Ohio on July 25. “But that’s not gonna to get it done.” </p>

<p>Laurie Mahoney was in a Twin Cities hospital, where both her parents were nearing death, when she got the call from her nephew Brett Blader. </p>
<p>Mahoney’s son, Ryan Briese, 34, was dead from a drug overdose in the Minnetonka home that Blader and Briese shared. </p>
<p>“I was in complete shock,” Mahoney said, recounting that July 19 night when Blader told her the news. “I had to leave my parents” at Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park. </p>
<p>Two hours later, her father, Dan Mahoney died, she said. </p>
<p>“How do you process that two of the most important men in your life are dead?” Mahoney said on the day her son’s alleged drug provider was charged with murder. </p>
<p>Mahoney was in Hennepin County District Court on Tuesday when Sarah E. Doppler, 28, who had been her son’s co-worker at Comcast offices in Minnetonka, appeared and had her bail set at $200,000. </p>

<p>Doppler, of Golden Valley, was charged Friday with third-degree murder in connection with Briese’s overdose at the home in the 14000 block of Brandbury Walk. Her attorney was not immediately available to comment on the allegations. </p>
<p>The medical examiner’s office said Briese died after ingesting a mix of drugs, including synthetic opioids, fentanyl and an opioid analgesic. </p>
<p>Officers called to the home found Briese not breathing in front of his computer. He was declared dead at the scene. Police found drug paraphernalia and several tablets nearby with “E8” inscribed on them, according to the criminal complaint. </p>
<p>A friend told police that Briese had said that day that he was going to meet with Doppler, someone known to deal in illicit narcotics. Briese’s cellphone placed him near Doppler’s home on the day he died and contained text messages showing his intent to buy pills from her, according to the charging document. </p>
<p>Doppler is alleged to have sold Briese fentanyl, a drug considered far more addicting and deadly than heroin. </p>
<p>Briese attended Bloomington Jefferson High School, where his experience of being cut as a senior from varsity hockey tryouts in 2000 was recounted in the popular nonfiction book “Blades of Glory” by John Rosengren. </p>
<p>Briese went on to play with the Bloomington Amateur Hockey Association’s youth Junior Gold team, worked at a car dealership two years after graduation and kept skating recreationally, according to the book. </p>
<p>Matt Duncan, a close friend who played varsity for Jefferson and skated with Briese in their youth, said that he, Briese and a few other guys in their Jefferson days “were a tight group of kids.” When Briese was cut, he said, “that hit us pretty hard.” </p>
<p>Since her son’s death, Mahoney has started the Ryan’s Rink Rats Foundation and raised $7,000 for the hockey association that Briese called his hockey home for many years. Anyone seeking more information can e-mail ryansrinkrats@gmail.com or visit facebook.com/ryans­rinkrats. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Rio Nido, a popular Twin Cites jazz trio in the ’70s and ’80s, reunites: Tom Lieberman, Prudence Johnson and Tim Sparks.</div>
                                    </div>
<h3>Rio Nido’s comeback returns </h3>
<p>West Bank perennials of swing-era vocal jazz, the trio Rio Nido spruced up the ’30s and ’40s for 1970s and ’80s Minneapolis, refashioning the era of Al Jolson, Cab Calloway and the Boswell Sisters with a pinch of counterculture panache and social consciousness. Those values haven’t changed. And the trio’s musical virtues have aged well, thanks in part to vocalists/guitarists Prudence Johnson, Tim Sparks and Tom Lieberman — all pros with successful careers outside the band who know how to put on a show. (7 and 9 p.m. Wed., Dakota, Mpls., $25-$35, <a href="http://www.dakotacooks.com/">dakotacooks.com</a>)</p>
<h3>Making it up as they go </h3>
<p>A pair of saxophonists parrying riffs or passing bleats back and forth in a totally improvised setting? That often makes for compelling jazz. Le Voyage is one of the better quartets to emerge this year, with the horns in question being veteran Donald Washington and young’un Matt Trice. The rhythm section is similarly multigenerational with Washington’s longtime bassist Dick Studer alongside drummer Steve Hirsh. (9 p.m. Thu., Khyber Pass, St. Paul; $5, <a href="http://khyberpasscafe.com/music/">khyberpasscafe.com</a>)</p>
<h3>The kids are all right </h3>
<p>Hoaxer is one of the Twin Cities’ better young bands, playing Saturday at Black Dog. Another strong, adventurous young ensemble to watch is the sextet No Exit, featuring bassist Charlie Lincoln and saxophonist Peter Goggin from Hoaxer, as well as the comparably older whiz kid Levi Schwartzberg on vibes and rugged young talents on guitar, drums and trombone. (8 p.m. Fri., Jazz Central, Mpls.; $10, theillicitjazz workshop.info) </p>
<h3>Two guitars, one flow </h3>
<p>Two guitarists in one jazz ensemble can be dicey, but the way Dean Granros and Zacc Harris braid and diverge with their Tall Tales quartet is a treat. It doesn’t hurt that the rhythm section (drummer Jay Epstein, bassist Chris Bates) manages to be incisive and unassuming at the same time. (9 p.m. Fri., Dunsmore Room at Crooners, Fridley; $12, <a href="https://croonersloungemn.ticketfly.com/calendar">crooners loungemn.com</a>)</p>

<p>As a landmark election unfolds an ocean away, Minnesota’s vast Liberian community has sprung into action, throwing support behind candidates and working to sway family members’ votes. Calls home buzz with chatter about Tuesday’s presidential runoff, which pits Joseph Boakai, the current vice president, against George Weah, a retired soccer icon. </p>
<p>Hopes are high that this race will mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one elected president to another in decades, a critical test of the country’s democracy after a lengthy period of civil war came to an end in 2003. </p>
<p>For months, Minnesotans have been making their voices heard on social media and beyond, and wooing relatives to vote for their preferred candidates. Some have even flown back to Liberia to door-knock and watch the election action firsthand. </p>
<p>“Minnesota is just not an observer or a sideline cheering squad,” said Abdullah Kiatamba, a Liberian community leader and executive director of the nonprofit African Immigrant Services. “Minnesota is shaping and influencing things.” </p>
<p>Eager to get involved, members of the area’s large Liberian community are writing and sharing opinion pieces, planning watch parties and linking up with local offshoots of Liberian political parties with active presences in Minnesota. </p>
<p>“People are literally living in two worlds around this election,” said Kiatamba, who is personally backing Weah. “People are involved here as much as people on the ground.” </p>

<p>Community leaders say more than 30,000 people of Liberian descent live in Minnesota, with many concentrated in the northwest metro. They often describe Minnesota as home to the most Liberians outside Liberia. </p>
<p>The community’s size makes Minnesota “strategic ground” during elections, said Duannah Siryon, who’s involved with the Coalition for Democratic Change campaign, the political party of candidate Weah. </p>
<p>Major candidates commonly pay visits to the North Star State, eager to test their messages and build crucial support from a population that has strong financial pull with relatives still living in Liberia. Both presidential hopefuls have made Minnesota appearances, Liberian community leaders say. </p>
<p>“You cannot successfully win elections in Liberia without huge support from the diaspora community,” said Wynfred Russell of African Career, Education and Resource Inc., a metro-area nonprofit. </p>
<p>The diaspora, Russell said, wields significant economic power and influence, often sending regular financial support to family members back in Liberia. </p>
<p>“People will say openly, ‘Look, if you don’t support my candidate, you can rest assured I’m not going to send you money for Christmas.’ Folks will oblige,” Russell said. “Proverbially, you cannot bite the hand that feeds you.” </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">‘A new beginning’</strong></h3>
<p>Since October, Al-Hussein Fadiga has taken to the airwaves in Brooklyn Park to spread the word about the race and promote his preferred candidate, Vice President Boakai. </p>
<p>His online radio station, Radio Africa, attracts thousands of Liberian listeners across the globe. He runs the program with his brother, Hassan Fadiga. Al-Hussein Fadiga said the ability to share information online has been revolutionary in this year’s race. </p>
<p>“Social media has been a game-changer,” Fadiga said. “A lot of Liberians see this election as a new beginning.” </p>
<p>Some north metro residents, like Erasmus Tiampa Williams, have taken political action beyond computer screens, traveling to Liberia to campaign in person. A few months ago, Williams went from village to village and town to town to advocate for his chosen candidate, Boakai. </p>
<p>He said common concerns emerged on the campaign trail. </p>
<p>“People want change but also stability,” said Williams, who’s also the national vice chairman of the Unity Party in America and Canada, Boakai’s political party. “No one wants the country to return to war.” </p>
<p>Observers say the election so far has been peaceful, with Liberians around the world waiting to see if peace holds once the race is decided. </p>
<p>The first round of the presidential election took place in October without a candidate winning a majority, prompting Tuesday’s runoff between the top two finishers. The winner will take over for Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first democratically elected female head of state and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. </p>
<p>Attention now turns to the election results, which are expected to be certified in the coming days. Many say the closely watched outcome means as much in Minnesota as anywhere in the world. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A tenants’ attorney has asked Hennepin County District Court to hold a new landlord in contempt for failing to turn over keys, financial records and other information to an independent administrator appointed last week to take control of five south Minneapolis apartment buildings. </p>
<p>The landlord, Rickey Misco, <a href="http://m.startribune.com/court-referee-puts-five-minneapolis-apartment-buildings-sold-by-landlord-frenz-under-administrator/465304993/">was found </a>by district court housing referee JaPaul Harris to lack a valid apartment rental license and to be collecting rents illegally on 69 units. He was ordered to refund to tenants rents for September, October and November, and turn December rents over to the administrator.</p>
<p>Attorney Michael Cockson of Faegre Baker Daniels, working pro bono for the tenants, said Tuesday that Misco has offered “no cooperation” and has not turned over the money, which could total around $200,000. Cockson filed the contempt motion Friday and said he expected a hearing to be held this week or next. </p>
<p>Neither Misco, or his attorney, M. Juldeh Jalloh, could be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Misco, a former repairman for Stephen Frenz, one of the city’s biggest landlords, bought the buildings from him last summer on contracts for deed while Frenz was in the final stages of being banned by the Minneapolis City Council from holding a rental license. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://m.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-unanimously-revokes-landlord-s-rental-licenses/462873813/">council banned</a> Frenz earlier this month after it concluded he jointly owned some 60 rental properties with Spiros Zorbalas. Zorbalas was accused of operating substandard apartment buildings; Frenz has been similarly accused.</p>
<p>Under a contract for deed, if Misco defaults, ownership reverts to Frenz and Zorbalas, according to the city’s regulatory services division, and thus the two maintain control of the property. </p>
<p>The regulatory division refused to grant Misco a rental license, even as he was collecting rents and posting notices that he would evict tenants if they did not pay. </p>
<p>On Dec. 19, referee Harris found Misco should not collect rents, appointed James Bartholomew of Lighthouse Management Group as administrator and ordered Misco to cooperate. </p>
<p>“Mr. Bartholomew isn’t able to get notices out to tenants and collect the rent on Jan. 1,” said Cockson. “My fear is that Mr. Misco may collect January rent as well.” </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://m.startribune.com/in-unprecedented-move-minneapolis-seeks-an-administrator-for-23-apartment-buildings-housing-1-200-tenants/466008403/">separate motion</a> last Friday, the Minneapolis city attorney’s office asked the housing court to put an administrator in charge of 23 other buildings Frenz has sold on contracts for deed. A hearing is set for Jan. 3.</p>

        <title>Amid sales drop, Harley-Davidson wants to teach more to ride</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By IVAN MORENO — Associated Press</h4>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Harley-Davidson is placing a renewed emphasis on teaching people to ride as part of its efforts to attract more customers. </p>
<p>The Milwaukee-based company’s decision to expand the number of dealerships with a Harley “Riding Academy” comes as the industry grapples with years of declining sales and an aging customer base. </p>
<p>The program launched in 2000 with about 50 locations and now 245 dealerships in the U.S. offer the three- or four-day course. The company says about a quarter of those launched since 2014. </p>
<p>Harley sold 124,777 new motorcycles through nine months in 2017, down from 135,581 during the same period the previous year, according to the company’s most recent earnings report. </p>
<p>The Motorcycle Industry Council says the median age of motorcycle owners increased from 32 to 47 since 1990. About 46 percent of riders are over 50; only about 10 percent are 30-34. </p>
<p>Samantha Kay rode on the back of her father’s motorcycle growing up, but when the 25-year-old took a class to ride for the first time she couldn’t help being anxious. </p>
<p>“I think motorcycles inherently do scare a lot of people,” said Kay, a Milwaukee woman who is one of 50,000 people nationwide who took a riding course at a Harley-Davidson dealership this year. </p>
<p>The training is one of the ways Harley is trying to attract a new generation of riders like Kay amid big demographic shifts. </p>
<p>“Some of the aging Baby Boomers, which have been the guts of Harley-Davidson’s purchasers, they’re getting older and some of them are just getting out of the sport because they can’t handle the motorcycle anymore,” said Clyde Fessler, who retired from Harley-Davidson in 2002 after holding several executive positions over 25 years. He created what became the “Riding Academy.” </p>
<p>He said the idea “is getting people comfortable on a motorcycle and getting them to feel safe and confident.” </p>
<p>In addition to riders getting older, a slow economic recovery has made it harder for millennials to buy new motorcycles, said Jim Williams, vice president of the American Motorcyclist Association. </p>
<p>Among the newest models, a 2018 Softail Slim starts at $15,899 and a 2018 Sportster Forty-Eight at $11,299. </p>
<p>“The younger generations are buying plenty of motorcycles, they’re just not new,” Williams said. </p>
<p>But it’s not all the millennials’ fault, said Robert Pandya, who managed public relations for Indian Motorcycles and Victory Motorcycles. Pandya recently launched “Give A Shift,” a volunteer group discussing ideas to promote motorcycling. One of their conclusions, he said, is the idea that “if mom rides, the kids will ride.” </p>
<p>Currently, women are about 14 percent of the riding population, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. </p>
<p>“The biggest possible opportunity in motorcycling is to invite more women to ride,” he said. </p>
<p>That’s not lost on Harley-Davidson. Among the ways Harley-Davidson is trying to reach younger riders is by having motorcycle role-models like Jessica Haggett, the founder of the “The Litas” all-women motorcycle club, be a voice for the company on social media. And the company is also focusing advertising efforts in male-dominated sports like the X Games and UFC events popular with younger viewers. </p>
<p>“I think we have to work harder to gain share of mind with young adults, for example, in that they have other activities in their lives. They’re on screens, they’re connecting socially, they’re involved in gaming, they’re involved in other things,” said Heather Malenshek, Harley-Davidson’s vice president of marketing. </p>
<p>She said the easily customizable Sports Glide model that launched in November and the aggressive, performance-driven Fat Bob also have younger riders in mind. In all, the company plans to release 100 new motorcycles over the next 10 years. During that time, the company also wants to gain 2 million new riders. </p>
<p>Terri Meehan took plenty of motorcycle rides with friends as a passenger but has wanted to be in the driver’s seat for a while. The 42-year-old took the Harley-Davidson riding course in October because she wanted to learn from “an expert who could teach right way versus someone who had learned bad habits.” </p>
<p>The price of the class varies by dealership but it’s generally about $300. Students spend time in class learning about motorcycle safety and on ranges learning to ride. Meehan plans to buy a motorcycle soon. </p>
<p>“My son’s a psychology major so he asked me if I was going through a mid-life crisis, which is actually quite hilarious,” said Meehan. </p>
<p>Kay’s experience notwithstanding, another challenge for Harley-Davidson is motorcycling simply isn’t a major part of people’s upbringing like it was once, Malenshek said. </p>
<p>“If you think about Baby Boomers, they probably were brought up on a dirt bike or had an uncle or a neighbor or something who was riding around in a Harley-Davidson. That may not be the case today,” she said. </p>
<p>She said the company’s CEO, Matthew Levatich, is encouraging employees to engage people in conversations about motorcycling if someone happens to say, “Nice bike.” Melanshek took that to heart during an interaction with someone at a gas station who complimented her on her motorcycle and told her he’d never thought about riding. </p>
<p>“And I said, ‘I can get you hooked up with the riding academy!’” </p>

Omer spoke at a press conference at Brian Coyle Center on Wednesday, December 20, 2017, in Minneapolis.</div>

<p>Canada Arten boarded a flight back to Africa this month — after eight years awaiting his deportation and months of last-ditch efforts to avert it. But in a stunning reversal for the Twin Cities man and 91 other deportees on board, the plane turned back to the United States. </p>
<p>The flight’s return has landed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a legal, logistical and public relations morass. The case of Arten, who arrived as a refugee but lost his legal status after a robbery conviction, highlights the cascade of complications triggered by the failed mission. A federal lawsuit in Florida on behalf of him and other passengers, who allege physical abuse aboard the flight, has blocked their deportations until at least Jan. 8. </p>
<p>In federal court in Minneapolis, Arten’s attorney successfully argued the botched flight puts into question the government’s ability to send people back to Somalia; Arten could be released in a month. </p>
<p>The legal challenges could have long-term significance, tackling a question fought out in courtrooms across the country: How much of a role can the courts play in deportation challenges? The government disputes the passengers’ allegations and the idea that it can’t pull off deportations to Somalia. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t think this one failed mission, despite all the publicity, detracts from all the successful missions that have gone before, which of course do not get the same publicity,” said Ann Bildtsen, an assistant U.S. attorney, in a Minneapolis courtroom. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Mission gone wrong</strong></h3>
<p>Arten came to the United States in his early teens after losing family members in Somalia’s civil war. He was ordered deported in 2009, three years after his felony robbery conviction. But at the time, ICE could not send him to Somalia, which did not have a functioning government. Arten, who had prior convictions for assault and disorderly conduct, went on to rack up offenses for car theft, terroristic threats and drunken driving, among others. </p>
<p>A federal judge this week said that “the severity and frequency of Arten’s criminal activity has subsided in recent years,” and his mother, Lul Hussein, said he cared for her as she battled kidney disease. </p>
<p>In March, ICE detained him and set out to deport him. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rising-deportations-to-somalia-raise-concerns-in-minnesota/426385301/">Deportations to Somalia</a> resumed and picked up under President Barack Obama; under Donald Trump, their numbers have swelled, to 520 this past fiscal year.</p>
<p>In the following months, an immigration judge denied a request to reopen Arten’s case, and the Board of Immigration Appeals denied his appeal. A second attempt to reopen his case based on worsening security in Somalia also failed; an appeal is pending, but a request to stay his deportation was denied. </p>
<p>On Dec. 7, Arten got on a chartered flight to Senegal, the first leg of his return to Somalia. ICE says two-thirds of the passengers had criminal convictions, including for murder. Others had unsuccessfully sought asylum, including a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular technician and an Owatonna police officer who has a U.S. citizen wife and children. </p>
<p>In court documents, ICE says shortly before the plane landed in Senegal’s capital, Dakar, the relief crew notified the agency that a hotel power outage prevented them from getting required rest. The original crew went to a hotel to rest, and the plane sat on the runway for more than 20 hours, after Senegal refused to allow deportees to get off. Because of the delay, ICE said, the plane would have had to wait another 20 hours before continuing to Djibouti to meet a connecting flight to Somalia. Because of crew fatigue and the detainees’ “restlessness,” the agency made the call to fly back to Florida, where the passengers are now detained. </p>
<p>This week, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., wrote to ICE demanding answers about the Somalia mission. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">A legal opportunity?</strong></h3>
<p>Earlier this week, the University of Minnesota’s Center for New Americans, the University of Miami School of Law and two other organizations filed <a href="http://strib.mn/2D9mcAv">a federal lawsuit in Miami</a>, alleging ICE officers and contract guards kicked, struck, dragged, choked and bound detainees during the Dakar layover. The suit also says the passengers sat shackled for more than 40 hours and did not get enough food or bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>Attorneys argue the international headlines about the failed mission make returning the deportees even riskier. They say the publicity has alerted the terror group Al-Shabab, linked to the October bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 500. </p>
<p>The government denied the deportees were mistreated and argued the Miami court does not have jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, lawyers have seized on the failed mission in a flurry of legal challenges. For example, local attorney Mirella Ceja-Orozco asked the local immigration court to revisit the case of client Rahim Mohamed, a truck driver facing deportation over a years-old conviction. </p>
<p>In Minneapolis federal court, Arten’s attorney asked for a temporary restraining order, arguing to send him back before his appeal is resolved would violate his due process rights. There’s more: Arten has been detained longer than six months, which means the government needs to show it can deport him soon or let him go. Rachel Petersen, his attorney, said she doesn’t buy the government’s explanation for the flight’s return, suggesting it has to do with Somalia’s past intransigence on deportations and unstable conditions. </p>
<p>“A plane went all the way to Africa, sat for a day and instead of continuing across Africa, returned to the U.S.,” she told Magistrate Judge David Schultz. She said Arten, who broke his wrist in a fall and still wears a cast, was extremely uncomfortable and was slapped by a guard. </p>
<p>Bildtsen, the government attorney, noted that Arten has gone to immigration court and the board of appeals twice, taking “a second bite at the apple.” “At what point do we reach a point of finality so the law can be executed?” she said. </p>
<p>To complicate matters for the government, a travel document the Somali Embassy issued for Arten expires this month. Bildtsen argued the Minneapolis court doesn’t have jurisdiction — and doesn’t need to issue a separate order given the stay in Miami as securing new documents and planning another mission will take time, she said. </p>
<p>But Schultz noted that means Arten might have to be released in the wake of the failed flight, which he dubbed “a bit of a mystery.” He found that Arten should stay until his appeal is decided and gave the government 30 days to release him or show it can deport him soon — findings the government can challenge. </p>
<p>Jurisdiction is a key question, said Rebecca Sharpless at the University of Miami. In 2005, Congress gave sole authority for deportation challenges to the immigration appeals board. But in recent years, federal courts have carved out exceptions. In fact, the court in Minneapolis kept two men from boarding the Dec. 7 flight to Somalia. </p>
<p>Michele McKenzie at Minneapolis-based nonprofit Advocates for Human Rights, which helped with the Miami suit, says attorneys and advocates will highlight the December mission’s failure to question the wisdom of attempting more and call for more transparency about the flights. </p>
<p>Said McKenzie, “We know we can’t pretend this didn’t happen.” </p>

Sanford Health, which is a big operator of hospitals and clinics in the Dakotas and Western Minnesota, currently has 35 weight-loss stores in 11 states, including some that are run by franchisees.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>﻿A growing chain of weight-loss stores from Sioux Falls, S.D.-based Sanford Health has landed in the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>A local franchisee opened the first <a href="http://profileplan.net/">Profile by Sanford</a> store in the metro late last month, and has plans for another five outlets at retail centers across the Twin Cities by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Currently, Sanford and its franchisees operate 35 stores in 11 states, and have plans for more than 70 new stores over the next two years. </p>
<p>The moves come as researchers say the percentage of overweight and obese adults is growing, while the share of those trying to lose weight has been declining. </p>
<p>Sanford officials believe they are offering an effective approach to weight loss, and are betting the health system’s brand can expand to new products — much like Sanford and Minneapolis-based Allina Health System are trying their hand these days at selling health insurance. </p>
<p>“Just as Allina [and Sanford] think that operating their own insurance companies leverages the positive feelings that people have about their health providers, I would say that Sanford is finding that they can extend those positive feelings to other ventures, like nutrition and lifestyle coaching,” Allan Baumgarten, a health care analyst in St. Louis Park, said via e-mail. </p>
<p>Sanford Health is already a big name as a hospital and clinic operator in western Minnesota, with the Minnesota Department of Health tracking 429 available beds at 15 hospitals. It’s one of the larger health care systems in the Upper Midwest, with a total of 44 hospitals and nearly 300 clinics in nine states. </p>
<p>For the fiscal year ending June 30, Sanford posted operating income of $151 million on $4.4 billion in revenue. In November, the system announced its first international hospital investment by acquiring a minority stake in a medical center in Germany. </p>
<p>In October 2012, Sanford launched the weight-loss business, which aspires to compete with big national names like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig. </p>
<p>People who access the service at a Profile by Sanford storefront pay a $300 annual fee that provides personal coaching and development of a weight-loss plan. At the outset, customers replace all grocery store food with food sold by Profile, said Tom Grady, the franchisee working with other investors to bring the stores to the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>The 25 stores open for the entirety of the 12-month period ending in June had collective gross sales of about $30 million and were serving about 28,000 members, according to documents filed with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. They describe the stores as “weight management centers.” </p>
<p>Sanford Health clinicians researched the science behind the weight-loss program, although published studies showing its impact aren’t yet available, said Nate Malloy, a vice president for the business. Most Profile by Sanford stores right now are owned by the health system, but franchisees will play a bigger role going forward. </p>
<p>“People that are truly having and experiencing life-changing results [are] driving 100 percent of our growth,” Malloy said. Program participants receive a scale that provides wireless, real-time progress monitoring through web and mobile apps. </p>
<p>Technology is a big part of the evolving weight-management market, according to research from Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, who covers Weight Watchers. </p>
<p>“We believe mobile apps and other technologies have commoditized aspects of the weight-management category,” Hottovy wrote last month. “Although we don’t view Weight Watchers’ clinically proven platform as a commodity product in an industry rife with false claims, we believe the previous lack of program and technology innovations made it difficult for consumers to distinguish Weight Watchers’ in-person and online businesses from new rivals.” </p>
<p>Through the first nine months of 2017, Weight Watchers posted net income of $100.5 million on revenue of $994.4 million. A company spokeswoman pointed to a recent report from Marketdata LLC, a market-research firm that projects the commercial weight-loss programs market is growing about 9 percent this year to $3 billion. </p>
<p>Commercial programs are just one of 10 major segments that Marketdata says are collectively worth about $66 billion. But Marketdata recently noted headwinds: “The number of active dieters is estimated to have fallen 10 percent since 2015, to 97 million, due to a growing size acceptance movement and dieter fatigue.” </p>
<p>In March, researchers in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted similar trends. In a study that included 27,350 participants, researchers observed that overweight and obesity prevalence increased from 52.7 percent in 1988-94 to 65.6 percent in 2009-14. The share of those trying to lose weight declined from 55.7 percent in the earlier period to 49.2 percent in 2009-14. </p>
<p>“Socially acceptable body weight is increasing,” researchers wrote. “If more individuals who are overweight or obese are satisfied with their weight, fewer might be motivated to lose unhealthy weight.” </p>
<p>Sanford said the Profile program already has helped nearly 800 people in the Twin Cities through a phone-based coaching model. </p>
<p>Grady, the local franchisee, said his company hopes to convince those clients to become customers at the new brick-and-mortar operations. Sanford Health will continue to own and operate Profile stores in Mankato and St. Cloud. </p>
<p>“We will continue to expand nationally, in North America, with additional locations owned by … Sanford Health, but at the same time leverage the franchise model to have a broader reach and a broader impact,” Malloy said. “We believe that our franchise partners are able to help us expand into markets that perhaps we wouldn’t be able to get to from a corporate standpoint as fast.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>In a message to political supporters, Attorney General Lori Swanson said Tuesday that she would file a lawsuit with other state attorneys general asking the court to overturn a federal decision that repeals a rule designed to keep access to the internet free and open. </p>
<p>The move would challenge the Federal Communications Commission’s <a href="http://www.startribune.com/as-net-neutrality-vote-nears-some-brace-for-a-long-fight/464061773/">recent overturning</a> of “net neutrality,” a 2015 regulation mandating that internet companies treat all traffic equally and not create slow or fast lanes for companies based on extra fees.</p>
<p>“Without net neutrality, broadband companies are free to block content they don’t want you to see, to slow it down and make it harder to access, or to prioritize content based on who pays them money,” Swanson wrote to supporters in an e-mail. “Mega corporations can dominate the content people see online by paying money to obtain faster speeds. This will make it more difficult and more expensive for consumers to access the content they want.” </p>
<p>Over the summer, the FCC’s proposal drew a record 20 million-plus public comments. The commission voted 3-2 this month to undo the Obama-era rule, with Chairman Ajit Pai saying the move would benefit consumers and give broadband providers more incentive to build networks. </p>
<p>The FCC’s ruling was always expected to draw legal challenges, and attorneys general of New York, Oregon, Washington, Illinois and Iowa have already expressed an intent to sue. Litigants have to wait 10 days until after the decision is posted in the federal register, which has yet to happen. </p>
<p>Swanson, a DFLer, is considered a likely contender for next year’s gubernatorial race. </p>
<p>She concluded her e-mail with praise for Sen. Al Franken, a fellow DFLer who is leaving office next week and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/franken-open-internet-advocates-push-back-as-fcc-moves-to-dismantle-net-neutrality/441196013/">has made</a> the preservation of net neutrality one of his biggest causes.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>Some local bars are preparing to keep the Super Bowl party going through the night when football fans descend on the Twin Cities in February. </p>
<p>St. Paul leaders voted last week to allow bars to sell alcohol until 4 a.m., beyond the usual 2 a.m. closing time, if they get a permit. Minneapolis and Bloomington passed similar measures this fall. </p>
<p>The special permits are possible because of a change in state law <a href="http://www.startribune.com/bill-would-let-bars-stay-open-till-4-a-m-during-2018-super-bowl-week/410884045/">approved by the Legislature</a> this year that extends the state’s allowed liquor sales hours during the Super Bowl weekend — from Feb. 2 to 5.</p>
<p>About 16 businesses have already signed up in Bloomington, said Doug Junker, the city’s license examiner and deputy city clerk. Most are in or near the Mall of America. </p>
<p>“We’ll see what this brings, being that we have so many hotels here,” he said. “Everybody’s going downtown [in Minneapolis], but they’re coming home here.” </p>
<p>About 15 St. Paul businesses expressed interest when the city queried them earlier this year, said Robert Humphrey, public information officer with the city’s Department of Safety and Inspections. That’s out of about 225 businesses that would be eligible. </p>

                  The Legislature approved a change in state law that lets bars sell liquor after the normal 2 a.m. closing time.
              </div>
       </div>

<p>So far only one has asked for an application: Kelly’s Depot Bar in Lowertown. </p>
<p>“It’s just an extra little boost and business for a couple of days,” said Patty Kelly, a manager at Kelly’s. </p>
<p>In Minneapolis, six businesses have applied for the special licenses. Two are nightclubs: Monarch Minneapolis and Privé. The others are Maxwell’s American Pub, Last Call Bar &amp; Grill, Randle’s Restaurant and Bar and Hop21. </p>
<p>Maxwell’s general manager, Mike “Rosie” Rosenstiel, said they only plan on staying open that late if someone rents out the bar for a private event. </p>
<p>Smaller parties like that are still being planned. “We should know … once the local teams are decided, whether it’s the Vikings or somebody else,” Rosenstiel said. </p>
<p>It isn’t the first time in recent years bars have remained open later. About 30 Minneapolis businesses extended their hours during the All-Star Game in 2014. State law also allowed for later hours during the Republican National Convention (RNC) in 2008. </p>
<p>“We didn’t get a ton of them for RNC,” Junker said. “But the RNC and the Super Bowl are different animals.” </p>

Mattern worked at RyKrisp for 35 years. They are in what was formerly where the ovens were.</div>

<p>Not a single person was wearing a hairnet. </p>
<p>That was one of the first things Liz Mattern noticed when she walked into what was a factory she once worked in. </p>
<p>The other thing? </p>
<p>“It smells different,“ said Mattern. “Used to be we could smell crackers baking when we walked up.” </p>
<p>That was when the southeast Minneapolis building was home to RyKrisp. </p>
<p>For more than three decades, Mattern, of Shoreview, worked here, where the once-popular crackers were mixed, baked and packed. </p>

                  The oven room at the former RyKrisp building is now a production area for wood products maker Woodchuck USA.

<p>Now, the same space where workers like Mattern once punched a clock is a hive of mostly millennial entrepreneurs hustling to build their brands. The rejiggered building, known as North Co., is an example of how work — and expectations for a middle-class livelihood — have changed in the past half-century. </p>
<p>“What you see in that building captures a broad transformation in the workforce,” said Prof. William Jones, a labor historian at the University of Minnesota. “It reflects the way the economy is structured, with the shift from manufacturing to the more high-paid information work.” </p>
<p>If Mattern, who wore a company-issued uniform, steel-toed boots and the omnipresent hairnet, is emblematic of the building’s first life, then Angela Sauro represents its second. Standing at a computer design station clad in running shoes, yoga pants and a hoodie, the 23-year-old designer works in e-commerce, customizing wooden products ordered over the internet. </p>
<p>“My title is ‘laser dragon,’ ” Sauro said. “We all have fun names for our jobs. A dragon throws fire and since I work with lasers, so do I.” </p>
<p>Sauro works for Woodchuck USA, a five-year-old Minneapolis startup and the largest tenant in the North Co. building on SE. 9th Street, taking up half of its 80,000 square feet. The company manufactures dozens of wooden products, including cellphone cases, journals, flasks and boxes. </p>
<p>Sauro, a 2016 graduate of the University of Minnesota, came to Woodchuck because she wanted “a job where I could use my creativity,” she said. “I have independence; they trust me and I’m my own manager. I smile every day when I walk in the door.” </p>
<p>Even though the building no longer turns out crackers, its products are still American-made, said Ben VandenWymelenberg, 27, founder and CEO of Woodchuck USA and one of the co-developers of the building. </p>
<p>“That’s what we’re proud to be about with everything we’re making here.” </p>
<h3>Keeping the ‘cool’ </h3>
<p>While it’s been heavily renovated, the building still pays homage to its origins. </p>
<p>The Woodchuck machines hum in the stretch of the building once known as the bake shop, where three 110-foot-long ovens cranked out the crackers that were shipped to stores around the world. The renovation preserved the original scarred wooden floors, vintage metal doors and explosion-proof factory lighting, while incorporating contemporary must-haves — including standing desks, pingpong tables and bins of free snacks. </p>
<p>Even some of the RyKrisp machinery remains. A hulking steel compressor the size of a golf cart sits like a piece of sculpture in the kitchen common area. Nearby, a cast-iron wheel as big as a round dinner table is laid flat and topped with tempered glass, turned into lobby furniture. </p>
<p>“We kept the cool elements, said VandenWymelenberg. “The building helps attract the kind of businesses we want.” </p>
<p>Across the country, it seems that rehabbed industrial space is a draw for millennial employees. </p>
<p>In Troy, N.Y., a branding firm is housed in a former collar factory. An ad agency converted a tobacco factory in Winston-Salem, N.C., into its workspace. And an abandoned cookie factory in Pittsburgh is now Bakery Square, with more than 200,000 square feet of green office space. Google is its largest tenant. </p>
<p>“Everyone wants to work in a place like this. It’s the headline on our job postings, ‘Come work in our renovated factory space,’ ” said Gerard Garramone, vice president of operations for Woodchuck USA. “Offices with drop ceilings and cubicles are awful. The energy is different here.” </p>

<h3>Enter the entrepreneurs </h3>
<p>In its first year, North Co. is at capacity with 22 businesses, mostly started by people in their 20s and 30s. They include apparel companies, a social media agency, a video production company, a custom drum manufacturer and a medical device startup. A salon is in the first-floor space that once housed the RyKrisp company vault. </p>
<p>That’s a good sign, according to Amy Lynch, president of Generational Edge, a research firm that consults with companies on generational differences. </p>
<p>“Millennials have a strong entrepreneurial bent,” she said. “They grew up in an era when the traditional relationship between employee and employer broke down and long-term employment didn’t pay off for a lot of people, including their parents. </p>
<p>“The success stories they admire and follow are people who created their own direction.” </p>
<p>Of course, that freedom comes with a risk. </p>
<p>“Entrepreneurs make a risk exchange,” said Jones, the U professor. “There isn’t security but there is opportunity and for some of them, that will pay off.” </p>
<p>The working world was different when Mattern arrived at RyKrisp in 1974. She joined the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International, which bargained for safe working conditions, seniority and benefits. But she had no expectations that her satisfaction would be part of the package. </p>

<p>“When you pack crackers all day, it’s a grind. Our bosses did not consider it their job to make us happy. It was their job to make sure the work got done and our job to take care of it,” she said. “We were well paid, but we certainly earned those wages.” </p>
<p>The RyKrisp factory opened in 1922, and it retained a loyal following with Nordic Americans for its crackers, a crunchy companion to herring and cheese. </p>
<p>“When I started in 1974, we had probably 90 people working there and we were going 24 hours a day,” said Mattern, who retired in 2008. </p>
<p>But over the decades, it was bought and sold several times as tastes changed and sales dwindled. The crackers went out of production in 2015. </p>
<p>Mattern said she’s pleased that the building where she spent so much of her working life has itself found new life. And she’s tickled that the new owners left the RyKrisp logo in place. </p>
<p>“A nod to our history,” she said. “That’s a nice touch.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Add local government transparency and accountability to the list of 2017 losers in Minneapolis, thanks to an unnecessarily shifty year-end move by the City Council. </p>
<p>In case you missed <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-approves-10-000-raise-for-new-mayor-and-council/466010693/">the news</a> while preparing for the holidays in your own year-end rush, the council — led by secret Santa and outgoing President Barb Johnson — voted unanimously on Dec. 15 to increase annual salaries for its members and the mayor by $10,000. (Abdi Warsame was absent.)</p>
<p>The numbers are less troublesome than the process, or lack thereof. The raises were not on the pre-meeting agenda, no council committees had considered them, and there was no public comment period or public hearing. They also weren’t included in the city’s recently approved $1.4 billion <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-approves-10-000-raise-for-new-mayor-and-council/466010693/ ">2018 budget</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson, ending an otherwise solid career as a voice of reason on the council, introduced <a href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/File/756/2018-2021%20Council%20and%20Mayor%20Salaries%20Resolution.pdf">the resolution</a>, explaining during the meeting that the increases will put Minneapolis council members in similar salary territory with their full-time counterparts in Denver and Boston but still $20,000 below those in Portland and Seattle.</p>
<p>Minneapolis council members, who will be paid $98,695 next year, did receive 2.5 percent annual increases for the past four years after being paid $80,354 with no increases in 2012 and 2013. </p>
<p>Despite Johnson’s efforts, it’s difficult to make good comparisons. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman earns $126,000 a year (vs. the $126,528 post-raise salary for Minneapolis Mayor-elect Jacob Frey), and the capital city’s council members are paid $63,000 for what is supposed to be part-time work. </p>
<p>Hennepin County commissioners are paid $113,566 annually, with the exception of Republican gubernatorial candidate Jeff Johnson, who has kept his own salary at $108,093. </p>
<p>Not to be overlooked in the stealthy Minneapolis resolution is the provision that the mayor and council members also will receive raises in each year of their four-year terms. Those hikes will be tied to increases the council approves in the city’s collective bargaining agreements with unionized workers. Taxpayers should take note as those agreements take shape. </p>
<p>In a statement provided after the Dec. 15 meeting, city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie pointed out that the 2018 increases represent just 0.01 percent of the total 2018 budget. The money will be scraped from the approved budgets of several city departments that had received increases for new 2018 initiatives. </p>
<p>“The city anticipates no negative impact to current services provided to those who live, work and play in Minneapolis as a result of this council action,” McKenzie wrote. </p>
<p>The Star Tribune Editorial Board has long argued that pay for public officials needs to be relatively comparable to private-sector salaries for jobs with similar responsibilities. The elected representatives who control the state’s largest and most important city should receive competitive compensation. </p>
<p>But Minneapolis taxpayers also deserve a more accountable, more open process than what transpired at City Hall on Dec. 15. There will be five newcomers on the 2018 council, and Frey will move into the mayor’s office. As just part of the payback for the hefty salary increases they’ll benefit from, the newcomers and veteran council members should commit to more transparency in decisionmaking. </p>

<p>It is the season for holiday celebrations, for holiday shopping, office parties, family get-togethers. Everyone is expected to enjoy their time off work and their travel to holiday destinations. We all get a break in the routine of day-to-day life. </p>
<p>But that underlying routine of life is precisely what I miss. </p>
<p>Most of the year we are moored to society by a scaffold of routine. Days and weeks are much the same: the commute to work or classes, checking e-mail and social media, attending meetings, running errands. Days may vary in the substance of what we write or teach or do, but the structure is familiar. Whether driving our own cars or riding our regular trains and subways, most of us inhabit a relatively small geographical and institutional space. We see the same people, watch the same channels, listen to the same radio programs day after day. We have our lives organized efficiently to get us what we need — a string of pleasant days. </p>
<p>The holidays disrupt this calm routine we have built our lives around. Not being at work can be disorienting in itself. Work is central to our lives. Many of us experience the paradox of thinking we want time off from work, but really missing it when we cannot go to the office. </p>
<p>We may also find our home routine disrupted during the holidays by visiting family members who require attention, special food, entertainment. They want to argue about last year’s election; they get on our nerves. There is nothing to watch on TV as our favorite programs are either all reruns or disappear for a month, replaced by predictable holiday shows. </p>
<p>Likewise with radio. Music stations turn to “Feliz Navidad,” “Last Christmas” and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Talk radio is all “The best of …” or repeats of old programs. Even news programs cheat by rerunning segments they showed us “ … back this summer” or filling the time with reports of awful weather and snarled traffic and crowded airports. </p>
<p>It is as though suddenly nothing is happening in the world. </p>
<p>Magazines and periodicals for December and January shrink to half their size, are combined into one issue and are filled with the year in photos, lists of celebrities who died in the past year and countless other lists of what happened in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>It is the actual holidays themselves that break most with routine, even in this 24/7 world, as many businesses and stores either close or shrink hours. The streets are almost devoid of traffic; everything seems to have shut down. All is quiet. Everyone seems to be enclosed within a house somewhere with all of their relatives, cars parked in driveways. There is almost nowhere to go, no place open to do errands and shop, no crowds to be lost in, no hustle and bustle of crowds on the street. Boredom sets in. </p>
<p>So in spite of the joys of the season, I am always happy somehow when they are over, and I can return to that day-to-day routine where most of life is led. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Supporters of Marcus Fischer, including his father, Eric Fischer, in knitted Minnesota hat, headed toward Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office on Tuesday in Minneapolis.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Relatives and supporters of Marcus Fischer, a Minneapolis teenager who was shot by city police in an interrogation room last week, converged on the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office on Tuesday to demand that his family be allowed to visit him without supervision in the hospital. </p>
<p>Fischer has been under guard as he recovers from multiple shots and what police say are self-inflicted stab wounds. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, his supporters filed into a courtroom at the Public Safety Facility, including his father, Eric Fischer, who sat in the front row, holding his head in his hands. When Judge Gina Brandt announced that his son would not be appearing for at least another day, Eric Fischer let out a muffled cry of frustration. </p>
<p>It was the second missed court appearance in a row after Marcus Fischer, 18, was kept from court on Friday for what a judge called “medical reasons.” His current condition wasn’t known on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Minutes after the announcement, the group, numbering several dozen, started toward County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office on the 20th floor of the county Government Center. They crammed the lobby of Freeman’s office and asked to speak to him. </p>
<p>Freeman declined to come out, but his spokesman, Chuck Laszewski, listened as they aired their grievances: that after an initial visit under police supervision, Fischer’s father and sister had been barred from seeing him. </p>
<p>Community activist Mel Reeves and other speakers demanded to know why they were given no advance warning that Fischer’s court date was being moved again. </p>
<p>“This office can make a request to [Hennepin County Sheriff Rich] Stanek,” Reeves, an outspoken critic of police misbehavior, told Laszewski. “Exceptions can be made, and what we’re asking for is an exception.” </p>
<p>Reeves said later that authorities had agreed to allow the family visitation rights. </p>
<p>The case has raised concerns over how police officers deal with people who are harming themselves. </p>
<p>After his arrest Dec. 18 on suspicion of involvement with a robbery and shooting, Fischer was brought to police headquarters for questioning. At one point, he was left unattended in an interview room. When detectives returned, they found him cutting himself with a large folding knife that he brought into the room in his waistband, according to authorities. When he ignored orders to put the weapon down, and a Taser didn’t stop him, officers shot him as he moved toward the door — even as a detective was still negotiating with Fischer, according to sources. </p>
<p>The two officers who fired their guns — Sgt. Gene Suker, a 20-year veteran of the department, and officer Jerome Carey, who has one year with the department — are on routine paid leave pending the outcome of a state investigation into the incident. So is officer David Martinson, an eight-year department veteran who deployed the Taser. </p>
<p>The entire encounter was caught on video, which police union officials say will show the officers acted justifiably when they opened fire. </p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union questioned whether police could have done more to defuse the situation. </p>
<p>“You would think that the police would recognize this as a mental health crisis … a situation that demands careful, nonviolent de-escalation techniques to keep everyone safe,” the group said in a blog post last week. </p>

        <title>University of Minnesota memo sparks war of words; officials say there’s no ‘War on Christmas’</title>

        <summary>Advice on holiday parties was “ill-advised,” U admits.</summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Advice on holiday parties was “ill-advised,” U admits.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Maura Lerner</h4>
<p>It was, officials say, an “ill-advised” attempt to spark a conversation about religious diversity at the University of Minnesota. </p>
<p>But last week, a memo about holiday parties in the agricultural college sparked a backlash on social media that left U officials scrambling to explain that they were not, in fact, part of any “war on Christmas.” </p>
<p>The memo, which was circulated at a Dec. 6 lunch meeting, cautioned against using decorations, music and food that are “specific to any one religion” on campus. It specifically cited Santa Claus, Christmas trees, dreidels, menorahs, doves and the colors red and green as “not appropriate for gatherings and displays at this time of year.” </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A week later, <a href="http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/red-and-green-colors-not-appropriate-during-holiday-season-university-says">a story about the memo</a> ran on the website Intellectual Takeout, which quoted a law professor as saying: “This sounds like the university might be going a little bit berserk.”</p>
<p>From there, the news started spreading on conservative news sites like <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/40049/">the College Fix</a>, which delights in exposing political correctness on campus. “University memo: wrapped gifts, Santa, Christmas trees ‘not appropriate,’ ” ran the headline 10 days before Christmas.</p>
<p>The problem, says Evan Lapiska, a U spokesman, is that much of the coverage inaccurately portrayed the memo as official university policy. </p>
<p>“It was a well-intentioned but ill-advised attempt to spark a dialogue,” he said. “It was part of a lunch-hour discussion series that took on a life of its own.” The idea of banning Santa Claus or certain colors, he added, “is not something that the university would put forth or consider in any way, shape or form as potential policy.” </p>
<p>The memo, “Religious Diversity and Holidays,” was prepared for the Dec. 6 session of a program, known as Dean’s Dialogues, for students, faculty and staff in the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences. Only those who showed up received the handout, according to Lapiska. </p>
<p>It began: “We encourage units to recognize holidays in ways that are respectful of the diversity of the University community, and recommend the following for your consideration:” </p>
<p>Among the tips: “Keep the theme of any invitations neutral and nonreligious and not reflective of any one religious holiday.” In addition to Santa and other Christmas and Hanukkah symbols, the list of inappropriate items included angels, the star of Bethlehem, bows/wrapped gifts and bells. </p>
<p>Jon Miltimore, a senior editor at Intellectual Takeout, a Bloomington-based website, said he broke the story after a concerned U employee shared a copy of the handout. “It was a bit cloak and dagger,” he said. “The person was very adamant about remaining anonymous.” </p>
<p>While the university insists it’s not an official list of dos and don’ts, Miltimore said it could appear that way to employees. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure that the person that receives that letter understands the distinction,” he said. “We’re giving you this material and we’re telling you it’s inappropriate — but it’s not official policy?” </p>
<p>The story triggered a fair amount of outrage once it caught fire online. “I think probably because the document was so silly,” said Miltimore. “Saying certain colors are inappropriate, that Santa Claus is a religious icon. I think that’s what made the story [have] legs.” </p>
<p>Before long, strangers started posting “merry Christmas” on the university’s Facebook page, some with less than merry comments. “Boo!” wrote one man. “Go find a safe space and crawl into it.” </p>
<p>Lapiska, the U spokesman, argues that the story has been distorted in the retelling. “It’s very clear that it’s fed into a narrative that was convenient,” he said. But the U, he insists, is not waging war on Christmas. “If you’ve been on the U campus around the holidays, the gates of campus have red and green on them,” he said. Garlands abound. </p>
<p>Even President Eric Kaler made a joint appearance with Santa at the U’s cancer center. </p>
<p>Since the U started pushing back on the media accounts, some websites have updated their articles, declaring that the U was retracting the holiday restrictions. </p>
<p>Not so, says Lapiska. “There was no retraction, because there was never a restriction,” he said. </p>
<p>Still, “I think there’s certainly regret around how it has been characterized and perceived,” he said. “Certainly there will be a conversation, if it hasn’t already taken place, to see how we can learn from this moving forward and avoid a situation like this in the future.” </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">The MNsure call center in St. Paul. The question of whether MNsure’s call-center failure in 2016 could have been the result of a saboteur is not as outlandish as it might sound.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Just before Election Day in 2016, Minnesota’s health insurance exchange launched open enrollment. It was a debacle. </p>
<p>Within hours, the MNsure call center was deluged. As insurance shoppers complained of long wait times, Gov. Mark Dayton announced that the state’s IT division found that automated systems were flooding the phone lines. </p>
<p>“Somebody’s trying to jam the call center, and making robocalls to try to snafu the thing — which is deplorable,” Dayton said publicly at the time. </p>
<p>It was a striking claim: that a bad actor invested in seeing MNsure fail conspired to sabotage a system set up to help Minnesotans shop for health insurance. </p>
<p>Since that time, more than a year ago, Minnesotans have heard nothing more about it. </p>
<p>Minnesota IT Services (MNIT), the division that manages state computer networks, referred to its year-old statement on the incident, which said the investigation had been forwarded to the FBI. </p>
<p>The FBI declined to comment. </p>
<p>Dayton’s office responded to a broad public records request related to the incident by stating there is “no data responsive to your request.” </p>
<p>MNIT, responding to a similar request, released to the Star Tribune a brief e-mail chain from Nov. 23, 2016. </p>
<p>In an e-mail to an FBI agent, a MNIT investigator said there was no evidence the problem was internal. </p>
<p>“We have not been able to determine any legitimate, system-based explanation” for the incident, the state investigator wrote. </p>
<p>Dayton’s DFL Party tallied major losses in the election a week after the health insurance snafu and alleged hacking of the phone help line, the latest bad headlines about a continuing source of trouble for his administration. </p>
<p>Republicans and many consumers blamed changes to the health insurance market for premium increases of 50 percent or more in 2016. </p>
<p>And, since its rollout — fairly or not — the state health insurance exchange had become a symbol of government dysfunction and DFL overreach. </p>
<p>If Dayton was right, however, he was calling attention to a new and dark chapter in the nation’s increasing political polarization, this time manifested at the state level: sabotaging a duly elected government for partisan advantage. </p>
<p>“It’s a state analog to the Russia cybersabotage” of the 2016 presidential election, said Steven Schier, a Carleton College political scientist who has studied and written about partisan polarization. </p>
<p>The question of whether the call-center failure could have been the result of a saboteur, perhaps intending to embarrass Dayton’s DFL government a week before the election, is not as outlandish as it might sound. </p>
<p>While not commenting on this specific case, Michael Krause, FBI supervisory special agent, said attacks on government bodies from disgruntled employees and citizens are an emerging threat. </p>
<p>“They don’t like some political decision or public policy decision” and try to create mischief, he said. </p>
<p>R. David Edelman, former White House special assistant to the president for technology and now director of MIT’s Project on Technology, the Economy and National Security, said it’s easy to imagine an attack on MNsure. </p>
<p>“As a technical matter, it’s both highly plausible and reasonably simple — the sort of thing a [misguided] computer science undergrad could pull off with a couple of hours’ work,” he said. </p>
<p>In this scenario, the attacker would flood the system with data packets while masking the origin of the calls by making it seem like they were all coming from one number, a technique known as spoofing. </p>
<p>Michael Johnson, chair in Security Technologies at the University of Minnesota, emphasized he was merely speculating based on limited information. </p>
<p>But he said the incident was “more likely than not caused by a malicious party.” </p>
<p>Mark Lanterman, chief technology officer at Computer Forensics Services in Minnetonka, was more circumspect: “It wouldn’t be my first case in which a large project fails, heads are rolling and you need an explanation,” he said. </p>
<p>Whether the MNsure help line was sabotaged, the state should have been ready given the known vulnerabilities, Edelman said. </p>
<p>“The nature of a denial-of-service attack is that it’s a blunt instrument: crude and easy to put together, but also easy to overcome,” Edelman said. “That’s why it’s surprising that [state government] did not have a plan in place to defend its networks.” </p>
<p>Cambray Crozier, a spokeswoman for MNIT, said the state took steps this year to protect the MNsure open enrollment rollout, which was smoother than in years past. MNIT said the 2016 incident is evidence of the need for more state spending in cybersecurity. </p>
<p>“Nearly every government function that Minnesotans depend on is reliant on technology, but many of the systems we use today run on outdated, unsupported technology that makes them a prime target for attack,” said Aaron Call, the state’s chief information security officer. “Recognizing the growing threat, we have been advocating the critical need to modernize state systems and strengthen cyberdefenses to better protect Minnesotans.” </p>
<p>Now, Minnesota faces the prospect of political sabotage, which is commonplace in other parts of the world. </p>
<p>“It’s something we should be worried about,” Edelman said. “More than just politicians or parties, we’ve seen attempts to disrupt entire elections this way in Bulgaria and Ukraine. In other words, increasingly, a denial-of-service attack is on page one in the tyrant’s [or desperate politician’s] playbook.” </p>
<p>Not only is technology easily available, but the country’s tribal political mood, in which every election is portrayed as an apocalyptic event, will only encourage more attacks, Schier said: “We are in a broader environment of political polarization where this behavior is becoming more acceptable.” </p>
<p>Sabotage, Schier said, is a telling metaphor. </p>
<p>“It’s a military metaphor,” he said. “And military conflict usually involves spying and sabotage on both sides.” </p>
<p>If the MNsure phone line was sabotaged, can the crime be solved? </p>
<p>“There’s no perfect crime,” said the FBI’s Krause. </p>
<p>Kyle Loven, a former chief division counsel at the FBI in Minneapolis now at Computer Forensics Services, said attackers’ ability to conceal their digital fingerprints often make these crimes difficult to solve. </p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s virtually impossible,” he said. </p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — A plane heading from Los Angeles to Tokyo turned back because an unauthorized person was on board. </p>
<p>KABC-TV reports All Nippon Airways Flight 175 left Los Angeles International Airport around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, but it never arrived at Tokyo’s Narita International Airport. </p>
<p>Model Chrissy Teigen, who was on the plane, tweeted that the flight made a U-turn about four hours into the 11-hour flight. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Teigen says passengers were told that someone had managed to board the ANA flight with a United Airlines ticket. </p>
<p>The plane landed at LAX around 7:30 p.m. after eight hours in the air. </p>
<p>Teigen says police interviewed passengers who were sitting near the person. </p>
<p>Airport police tell KABC-TV that there was a “mix-up” that’s been resolved, and the flight has been rescheduled to depart Wednesday. </p>

Obama told Prince Harry in an interview broadcast Wednesday, Dec. 27, 2017, that he felt serene the day he left the White House despite the sense that much important work remained unfinished.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>LONDON — Former President Barack Obama told Prince Harry in an interview broadcast Wednesday that people in leadership roles must be careful in their use of social media and warned against spending too much time immersed in the internet at the expense of the world outside. </p>
<p>Obama did not, however, directly mention his successor, President Donald Trump, who has made the use of Twitter a centerpiece of his presidency. </p>
<p>“All of us in leadership have to find ways to recreate a common space on the internet,” he said. “One of the dangers of the internet is people can have entirely different realities. They can be just cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.” </p>
<p>He spoke with Harry in the prince’s capacity as guest editor of the BBC Radio 4 news program. Both men said the interview, recorded in Canada in September, was Obama’s first since leaving the presidency in January. </p>
<p>Obama said he felt serene the day he left the White House at the end of his second four-year term despite the vast amount of work that remained unfinished. He said it was “hugely liberating” to be able to set his own agenda in the morning to have the time to talk with his wife, Michelle, now that he is no longer president. </p>
<p>“I miss the work itself because it was fascinating,” Obama said of his eight years in the Oval Office, citing his health care reforms as one of his proudest achievements. </p>
<p>In a brief live segment at the end of the show, Harry said he did not know if Obama would be on the guest list for his wedding in May to American actress Meghan Markle. </p>
<p>“I don’t know about that, we haven’t even put the invite or the guest list together, who knows if he’s going to be invited or not,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t want to ruin that surprise.” </p>
<p>The Sun newspaper, a popular tabloid, has suggested that the British government is concerned that Harry and Markle may invite the Obamas but not Trump, possibly straining ties between the two governments. </p>
<p>Harry did say his fiancee enjoyed her first Christmas with the royal family. </p>
<p>“The family loved having her there,” Harry said. </p>
<p>The prince used his position to ask Obama a “lightning round” of questions of the type normally asked of entertainers, not politicians. </p>
<p>The former president declined to say whether he wears boxers or briefs, preserving a bit of post-presidential dignity, but was willing to say he prefers Aretha Franklin to Tina Turner — “Aretha is the best,” he said of the Queen of Soul — and favors retired basketball star Michael Jordan over current phenom LeBron James. </p>
<p>Obama rejected gloomy prognostications about the state of the world, saying that in many ways the world is healthier and wealthier than it has ever been, making it perhaps the best time in human history to be born. </p>
<p>He cited improved treatment of African-Americans and greatly expanded opportunities for young women as achievements of the past few generations that give him hope for the future. </p>
<p>Harry also interviewed his father, Prince Charles, who offered a more downbeat assessment. He said the root causes of climate change are not being addressed even as it caused “untold horrors” in different parts of the world. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Paul Walsh</h4>
<p>A Christmas Day house fire in Marshall, Minn., killed one person, the Fire Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The blaze engulfed the home about 1:30 p.m. Monday in the 600 block of Elaine Avenue, a fire official said. </p>
<p>The resident who died has yet to be identified, and no one else was reported harmed. </p>
<p>Fire officials consider the home to be a total loss. What led to the fire remains under investigation. </p>
<p>Since Christmas, there have been at least five deaths in house fires in Minnesota. Four people died after a home <a href="http://www.startribune.com/hibbing-house-fire-kills-2-adults-badly-injures-2-children/466606123/">caught fire in Hibbing</a> on Tuesday, and a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/1-killed-in-lakeville-house-fire-2-flee-the-flames/466647113/">blaze in a Lakeville house</a> claimed one life Tuesday. Preliminary indications of how those fires began also have yet to be revealed.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>BEIJING — The Chinese owner of Sweden’s Volvo Cars is buying a stake in truck manufacturer AB Volvo, expanding a portfolio of vehicle brands that includes shares in Malaysia’s Proton and Britain’s Lotus. </p>
<p>Geely Holding Group said Wednesday the acquisition of shares from Cevian Capital, a fund manager, would give it 8.2 percent of Volvo’s share capital and 15.6 percent of voting rights. Financial terms weren’t disclosed, though analysts estimated the value of the deal at around 27 billion kronor ($3.3 billion). </p>
<p>The Swedish company, which also makes buses, construction equipment and diesel engines, was the parent of Volvo Cars until 1999, when it was sold to Ford Motor Co. Geely bought Volvo Cars in 2010. </p>
<p>“We recognize and value the proud Scandinavian history and culture, leading market positions, breakthrough technologies and environmental capabilities of AB Volvo,” said Geely chairman Li Shufu in a statement. </p>
<p>The transaction will make Geely the biggest single shareholder in Volvo and the second biggest holder of voting rights. Christer Gardell, the co-founder of Cevian Capital, said Geely would be able to provide Volvo with valuable access to the Chinese market and know-how in the field of electric and self-driving vehicles. </p>
<p>Li said Geely would support Volvo management’s current strategy. </p>
<p>Geely owns Geely Auto, one of China’s biggest independent automakers. It agreed in May to buy 49.9 percent of Proton and 51 percent of Lotus, which was owned by the Malaysian automaker. </p>
<p>Geely also launched a new brand, Lynk &amp; Co., in 2016. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Ben Goessling</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, who’s been one of the surprise stories of the 2017 NFL season, will be a free agent in March and is in line for a significant raise next year because of how he’s played while leading the Vikings to a NFC North title. </p>
<p>The fact Keenum has been the Vikings’ starting quarterback for most of this season has him set to earn a little extra money this year, too. </p>
<p>According to sources with access to NFLPA salary data, Keenum would make an extra $250,000 if he plays 85 percent or more of the Vikings’ offensive plays this season. Keenum, who’s played 90.4 percent of the team’s offensive snaps this year, would hit the bonus if he starts on Sunday. He’d earn $150,000 if he plays 75 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps, but with the team still trying to secure a first-round bye against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Keenum figures to play. </p>
<p>He’d also add to a per-game roster bonus that pays him $46,875 each time he’s on the 46-man active roster on game day. Keenum has been active for every game this season, and would maximize his roster bonus at $750,000 if he’s active on Sunday. If he starts and plays most of the Vikings’ snaps, his bonuses and incentives for the season would total $1 million, in addition to $950,000 base salary, $250,000 signing bonus and $50,000 workout bonus. </p>
<p>That’d give Keenum a total of $2.25 million for the season. In any case, he’s going to end the year as a major bargain for the Vikings. But as the team turned to him, it also gave the quarterback a chance to earn a little extra cash. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at several other Vikings players who have a shot at incentives and roster bonuses in the regular-season finale. </p>
<p><strong>G Joe Berger: </strong>Can earn an extra $900,000 if he plays 90 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps (Berger has missed just two snaps all season). Berger can also cap out his per-game roster bonus at a total of $250,000 by being on the active roster for the 16th time this season on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>WR Michael Floyd: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $171,875 by being active for his 11th game.</p>
<p><strong>LB Emmanuel Lamur: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>LS Kevin McDermott: </strong>Will likely end the season with per-game roster bonuses of $23,437.50, given the fact he’s expected to miss Sunday’s game with a dislocated left shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>RB Latavius Murray: </strong>Can reach a $500,000 incentive, as well as a $500,000 salary escalator for 2018, by rushing for 169 yards on Sunday and finishing with 900 yards for the season. Can earn another $46,875 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season to tal to $750,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>CB Terence Newman: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Newman, who’s played 56 percent of the Vikings’ defensive snaps this season, is likely to fall short of a $150,000 incentive for playing 65 percent of the Vikings’ defensive plays.</p>
<p><strong>TE Kyle Rudolph: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Rudolph, who has 56 catches this season, won’t hit a $375,000 salary escalator for 2018 by reaching 80 catches this year, but already triggered one for next season by catching 83 passes last year.</p>
<p><strong>PR Marcus Sherels: </strong>Can earn a $100,000 incentive if he finishes the regular season as the NFL leader in punt return average. Sherels, who is currently sixth in the league with an average of 10 yards per punt, would need a prolific day to vault up the standings; the Lions’ Jamal Agnew currently leads the league with a 16.0 average.</p>
<p><strong>S Harrison Smith: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>WR Adam Thielen: </strong>Can earn a $1 million salary escalator for 2018 by catching five passes on Sunday, bringing his season total to 90 catches. Thielen has already secured a $750,000 salary escalator for next year by reaching 80 catches.</p>
<p><strong>WR Jarius Wright: </strong>Can make another $93,750 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $1.5 million by being on the 53-man roster for his 16th game. Wright restructured his deal with the Vikings before the season, taking a $1.05 million base salary instead of the $2.5 million he was scheduled to receive and converting $1.5 million to per-game bonuses. The restructuring came just before roster cuts at the end of the preseason.</p>
<p>Wright caught just 11 passes last season; with rookies Rodney Adams and Stacy Coley on the team’s initial 53-man roster, and Floyd set to join the team in October after a four-game suspension, the Vikings clearly wanted to retain some flexibility with the 28-year-old. The team wasn’t in a tight cap situation, and players don’t usually agree to convert base salaries to week-to-week bonuses unless they believe they’re at risk of not earning the money at all. </p>
<p>But Adams eventually wound up on the practice squad; Coley has played 27 snaps this season, and Floyd has caught only 10 passes for 78 yards. Wright has 18 catches for 178 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He could have to fight to stick around again in 2018, when his base salary is scheduled to jump back to $3.6 million, but he’s handled his role without griping and continued to prove his value. </p>

<p>After the first two-interception game of his career, Vikings safety Harrison Smith has been named the NFC Defensive Player of the Week. </p>
<p>Smith picked off two passes in the Vikings’ 13-0 win over the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night, stepping in front of a Brett Hundley throw to thwart the Packers’ best chance to score in the first half and sealing the game with a sideline interception in the fourth quarter. He also posted eight tackles, including one for loss, and broke up two passes. </p>
<p>The safety, who was not named to his third Pro Bowl despite his role in the league’s top-ranked defense, has matched his career high with five interceptions this season, while recording 1 1/2 sacks and 72 combined tackles. </p>
<p>He is the third Vikings player to win NFC Player of the Week honors this season, and the first on the defensive side of the ball to claim the honor; Sam Bradford was the NFC Offensive Player of the Week in Week 1, and Kai Forbath won NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors in Week 7. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The engagement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has dominated the covers of supermarket tabloids since it was announced in November. And it’s likely to stay that way until they get married in May. </p>
<p>Which raises a question that comes up every time a member of the British royal family walks down the aisle: Why are Americans so obsessed with this topic? </p>
<p>After all, as an op-ed in the Washington Post argued recently, the Founding Fathers “violently overthrew our tea-sipping stamp-taxing overlords in large part so that we should not have to genuflect in front of the altar of royal bloodlines.” Right? </p>
<p>Yet Americans do love a British royal wedding. In 2011, they reacted with similar excitement to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. And the whole country stopped to watch Prince Charles and Princess Diana get married. </p>
<p>These bouts of monarch-mania in the former colonies have played out in a pop-culture environment shaped by imported shows like “Downton Abbey” and “The Crown.” We appear to be living in a golden age of American Anglophilia. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama even remarked upon it in 2015. “I think it’s fair to say that the American people are quite fond of the royal family,” Obama said during a White House visit from Prince Charles. “They like them much more than they like their own politicians.” </p>

<p>So what is the appeal? Observers of American Anglophilia say it is complicated. </p>
<p>Tom Sykes, an Englishman in Dublin who writes about the royal family for the Daily Beast, described the royals as the ultimate celebrities, albeit ones with “some meat on the bone.” </p>
<p>“I do think if you’re going to be interested in celebrities you don’t know,” Sykes said, “the royal family are probably more interesting people to be interested in than the Kardashians, say, because of the thousand years of history behind them.” </p>
<p>Glamour and escapism are a big part of the allure. It also helps that the British royal family does not play any formal role, ceremonial or otherwise, in American life. As such, they are insulated from the criticism about the cost of maintaining a monarchy — $57.6 million in taxpayer money during the 2016-17 fiscal year — that some in Britain criticize as out of touch. </p>
<p>Suzanne Mackie, executive producer of “The Crown,” attributed the royal family’s appeal in part to “the mystique, the mythology around the throne and the monarchy.” </p>
<p>That interest is very British-centric. </p>
<p>“Americans are particularly interested in the British monarchy, it’s not just monarchy in general,” said Arianne Chernock, a historian at Boston University. “You don’t see the same kind of interest directed at the Japanese Crown. I think it is about this special relationship, at root.” </p>
<p>Anglophilia in the United States dates back to “almost immediately after the American Revolution” ended British rule, Chernock said. “There is a desire to retain that strong cultural tie, and I think that persists to this day.” </p>
<p>It is a feeling that has long cut across the social divide. In 1860, when Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, visited the United States on the eve of the Civil War, hundreds of thousands gathered to see him, said Elisa Tamarkin, a scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>
<p>“The love of this 18-year-old traveling prince was described as a universal feeling,” Tamarkin said. “South Carolina had committed to secede if Abraham Lincoln won, Wall Street was in a panic, but the Prince of Wales was actually on the cover of Harper’s Weekly five times in six weeks.” </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>STROUDSBURG, Pa. — A Pennsylvania police officer has pleaded guilty to a plot to blackmail his wife over having sex with a 14-year-old boy while she has pleaded guilty to plotting to kill her husband. </p>
<p>Keith Transue, a Bushkill Township officer, pleaded guilty last week to misdemeanor criminal coercion, and Robin Transue pleaded guilty to felony solicitation to commit aggravated assault and statutory sexual assault. The Mount Pocono residents, both 43, are scheduled for sentencing March 20. </p>
<p>Authorities in Monroe County said in court documents that Robin Transue told an informant her husband threatened to expose her 2010 relationship with the boy if she left him. Prosecutors say she suggested several ways to kill her husband, including a drug overdose or a hunting accident. </p>
<p>“Mrs. Transue freely talked about arranging for her husband’s murder,” District Attorney Michael Mancuso said. “All kinds of potential death scenarios were discussed.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Keith Transue failed to report the abuse when he learned about it, as he was legally obligated to do as a police officer. </p>
<p>“Transue was using his wife’s crime to keep her from leaving or divorcing him. This in turn was essentially the motive for Robin soliciting Keith’s murder,” Mancuso said. </p>
<p>The police department placed Keith Transue on leave after the charges were filed, and Police Chief Mike McLouth said Wednesday said the officer had submitted a resignation letter. </p>
<p>Mancuso praised an informant who came forward and cooperated with police, saying he “likely prevented a homicide and also brought to light a sordid history of sexual assault and criminal coercion.” </p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — A Tokyo-bound flight returned to Los Angeles hours into the journey after the crew discovered that one of the passengers had boarded the wrong plane, All Nippon Airways said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The pilot of Flight 175 decided to return to the originating airport as part of the airline’s security procedures, ANA said in statements that apologized to passengers but supported the decision. </p>
<p>The flight left Los Angeles International Airport at 11:36 a.m. Tuesday and returned at 7:33 p.m. </p>
<p>Model Chrissy Teigen and her singer husband, John Legend, were aboard and she live-tweeted the developments. She wondered on Twitter why the plane was turning around four hours into the 11-hour flight. </p>
<p>“Why did we all get punished for this one person’s mistake? Why not just land in Tokyo and send the other person back? How is this the better idea, you ask? We all have the same questions,” she wrote. </p>
<p>Teigen also tweeted photos, videos and updates as they waited to resume the trip. </p>
<p>“Taking off!!!” she finally tweeted early Wednesday. </p>
<p>FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency conducted interviews Tuesday night but made no arrest. She said no charges were filed, but the investigation is ongoing. </p>
<p>A U.S. government official with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that the incident involved two brothers — one ticketed on ANA and the other on a United Airlines flight leaving about the same time. </p>
<p>The official who spoke on condition of anonymity says both cleared security and had valid boarding passes. ANA and United are codeshare partners. </p>
<p>ANA said it was trying to determine how the passenger boarded the wrong flight. </p>
<p>“At the time during the flight, the pilot in command was presented with information about the discrepancy in the passenger manifest. Based on the available information in flight, he made the correct decision to return to LAX,” ANA said. </p>
<p>The airline said it supported the pilot’s decision “out of the abundance of caution and safety for the passengers and crew.” </p>
<p>“ANA would like to express its apologies to the passengers for the inconvenience,” the airline said. “We take great pride providing exemplary customer service, and on this flight we failed to do so.” </p>

<p>The National Football League is on message with the Bold North theme for Super Bowl LII ane then some in a television commercial called, “The Will to Survive.” </p>
<p>The 30-second spot features NFL stars such as Von Miller, Earl Thomas and Dak Prescott, trudging through a snowy, frozen mountain pass landscape, wind howling fiercely as a cloudy image of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in his uniform briefly appears in the dark sky. </p>
<p>The players wear furs, heavy boots and carry hiking sticks looking ready to step into a gnarly story arc on HBO’s Game of Thrones series. Maybe I missed it, but I didn’t see any Minnesota Vikings featured in the spot. </p>
<p>The ad culminates with an image of U.S. Bank Stadium, aglow in purples and blues, atop a mountain off in the middle distance. Message: It’s going to take all you’ve got to get into the game Feb. 4. </p>
<p>Watch the spot here: <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wsP_/nfl-the-will-to-survive-featuring-dak-prescott-von-miller#">https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wsP_/nfl-the-will-to-survive-featuring-dak-prescott-von-miller#</a></p>
<p>The lead-up events start in less than a month on Jan. 26 with Super Bowl Live on Nicollet Mall. In the coming days, expect to see an increasing presence of Super Bowl ads around town featuring the theme colors of blue, purple and green, evoking the Northern Lights. </p>
<p>Let’s hope the weather isn’t as imposing as it appears to be in the ad or as it actually is this week. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">With nothing more than seeding at stake, it sounds as though the Rams are giving heavy consideration to resting a bunch of starters for Sunday’s finale against the 49ers.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Rand</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/randball/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/27104121/mcvay.jpg">Week 17 in the NFL is a weird mix of teams with nothing to play for but pride, others with plenty on the line and a few who have a little bit to play for but are more interested in answering the question of whether it’s more important to keep momentum going into the postseason or more important to give key players a week of rest.</p>
<p>In the NFC, there are some obvious teams who fall into these categories. </p>
<p>The Eagles are locked into the No. 1 seed and can decide whether to rest players or try to keep them focused knowing that they can rest the following week since they’ve earned a bye. </p>
<p>The Vikings are still working to clinch the No. 2 seed, and the easiest way to do that is to beat the Bears on Sunday. The Saints can clinch their division with a win over Tampa, while Carolina can steal the division instead with a win over Atlanta. The Falcons, too, can clinch a wild card spot with a win. </p>
<p>So the Vikings, Saints and Panthers have plenty to play for, while at least the Vikings and Saints opponents, the Bears and Tampa, have nothing but pride at stake. </p>
<p>In the weird middle, though, are the Rams. They’ve already clinched their division and sit at 11-4. With a win, they can lock up the No. 3 seed, but they can do no better than that. With a loss, they would fall no further than the No. 4 seed. In both cases, they’d have a home playoff game to start the postseason. </p>
<p>With nothing more than seeding at stake, it sounds as though the Rams are giving heavy consideration to <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000899051/article/sean-mcvay-rams-to-rest-some-starters-in-week-17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resting a bunch of starters for Sunday’s finale against the 49ers</a>.</p>
<p>“Being locked into that third or fourth seed — every single game is important — but I think it will provide an opportunity for us to potentially get some guys healthier, rest them, give some other guys a chance to step up,” head coach Sean McVay said Tuesday. </p>
<p>That decision could impact how the NFC playoff picture shakes out, and by extension could impact the Vikings. </p>
<p>A Rams win, as noted, would make them the No. 3 seed and put them on course to play either Seattle or Atlanta (the teams battling for the No. 6 seed) in the wild card round. If the Rams won that game, they would play the No. 2 seed in the division round — the spot that the Vikings will claim unless four different things go wrong Sunday. Even if New Orleans won Sunday, the Saints would be the No. 4 seed and would face Carolina in the wild card round. The winner of that game, assuming the No. 3 seed Rams won their game, would face Philadelphia. </p>
<p>But if the Rams lose and New Orleans wins Sunday, the Rams would be the No. 4 seed. New Orleans would be No. 3. And if both won in the wild card round, the Saints would play the Vikings (assuming they hold down the No. 2 seed) and the Rams would face the Eagles. The Rams could still defeat the 49ers Sunday even while resting players, but L.A. at full strength certainly has a better chance of doing that. </p>
<p>So McVay’s decision could be about giving players rest. It could also be about creating a potentially easier path in the playoffs. Who would you rather line up to face if you were the Rams: Carolina at home and Philly on the road or Seattle/Atlanta at home and the Vikings on the road? I’d pick the first one given how the Eagles have looked without Carson Wentz. </p>
<p>Either way, the Vikings would have a tough matchup in the division round if either New Orleans or the Rams advanced as the No. 3 seed. It’s entirely possible, of course, that one or both will lose, shaking up the seeding even more. Remember, the team with the worst remaining seed after the wild card round faces the No. 1 seed, while the better of the two faces the No. 2 seed. </p>
<p>And yes, the Vikings still need to secure that No. 2 seed. It’s worth noting on that front that the Rams’ decision could play a role in that as well. Though it shouldn’t come to this, the Vikings can still claim the No. 2 seed even with a loss to the Bears at home Sunday if New Orleans wins … or Carolina loses … or the Rams win. </p>
<p>If you thought the Rams game against the 49ers was a strong line of defense against catastrophe, it feels less like that if L.A. is resting a bunch of players. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A rare pour-your-own beer concept is coming to Minneapolis’ North Loop this spring. </p>
<p>First Draft Taproom &amp; Kitchen (324 6th Av. N., Mpls., <a href="https://www.firstdraft.beer/">firstdraft.beer</a>), a self-serve bar that started in Denver, will offer 54 taps, heavily featuring local brews, at its Twin Cities location.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: When patrons arrive, the staff will check their ID, swipe a credit card to start a tab, and hand them a tap card. </p>
<p>From there, drinkers set their own pace and determine how much — or how little — they’d like to consume. Each tap will be accompanied by a tablet with information about the brew. Using the card, patrons can pour as little as an ounce — prices range from about 40 cents to $1.20 per ounce — or as much as a full pint. </p>
<p>A similar concept, Union 32 Crafthouse, debuted in Eagan earlier this year. </p>

<p>“I was just at the point where I was inundated with all the new styles and the new beers that everyone was producing,” said First Draft founder Mark Slattery, who is partnering with Minnesota locals Andrew Valen and Joe Maselter. “If a place has 100 beers on tap, well, you have to pick a pint but you’re not sure what you like and if it’s worth the price. With [First Draft], it’s just a fun, centralized spot to come in and try all the state’s beers.” </p>
<p>Slattery said First Draft will purchase just one keg at a time of each beer, so the lineup will be constantly changing. A handful of ciders and wine will be on tap, as well. Locally inspired food, including walleye sandwiches, burgers and charcuterie plates, can be ordered at a walk-up counter. </p>

        <title>Timberwolves unveil gray ‘City Edition’ uniform</title>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Chris Miller</h4>
<p>Just in time for the fourth day of Christmas, the Timberwolves unveiled their fourth and final uniform — the City Edition — on Wednesday. </p>
<p>And here it is: </p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/cmiller_1514395884_grayagain.jpg"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The uniform will debut on Feb. 1 when the Wolves play the Bucks at Target Center. </p>
<p>According to a team press release: <em> The Timberwolves City Edition uniform follows the theme of “Bold North” which celebrates the area hosting Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018. The strength and civic pride of this region will be on full display over the next few months, which has been an inspiration for the design of the team’s City Edition uniforms. The primary color celebrates the tonal gray winter coat of the wolf, while the white mimics the snow-covered land that is the North. The color allows the Wolf to reflect its surroundings and be an apex predator while camouflaging and protecting the wolf, which is reflective of the “New Era” of Timberwolves basketball – hungry and determined to break through and establish a winning culture. The pattern of the jersey is representative of the wolf’s guard hair during the winter months, which represents our fans willingness to defend our team and home court.</em><br>
 <br>
The City Edition also will be worn April 5 at Denver, April 6 at the Lakers and at the home finale April 11 against Denver.</p>

<p>In county tax offices Wednesday across Minnesota, long lines snaked from counters and urgent phone calls poured in from that rarest of all creatures: Property owners who wanted to pay their taxes early. </p>
<p>“It’s a last shot at the deduction,” said Mark Chapin, director of Hennepin County’s Resident and Real Estate Services. “The demand to prepay is something we’ve never seen before and don’t expect to happen again.” </p>
<p>The rush was prompted by the newly enacted federal tax law that, after Jan. 1, will cap the annual state and local tax deduction at $10,000. </p>
<p>That’s a change that could cost some taxpayers thousands of dollars. And it’s the reason why Hennepin County officials decided to extend the hours they will accept prepayments on 2018 property taxes and set up the county’s website to take payments online. </p>
<p>As of late Wednesday, Hennepin County had received $47 million in prepaid property taxes. <span>In comparison, the county received about $6 million in prepayments in all of 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>Nearly 500 people have been coming in person each day to prepay their taxes, said Derrick Hodge</span><span>, the county’s resident services administrative manager in the Property Tax Division.</span></p>

<p><span>“It’s the most excited I’ve seen people come in and pay taxes,” he said. One example was taxpayer David Anderson,</span><span> who had a fairly hefty check in hand on the advice of his accountant — and said he was happy to turn it over.</span></p>
<p>The race to prepay is trending across the nation. <span>While the federal tax law specifically prohibited prepayment of income taxes to avoid the new limits, it didn’t include any language on early payment of property taxes. That means that property </span>taxes paid before Tuesday — New Year’s Day — can be deducted on 2017 returns, up to the amount stated on the truth-in-taxation notices sent out in November.</p>
<h3><span>Things were ‘blowing up’</span></h3>
<p><span>Because Hennepin County is home to 420,000 taxable property parcels and more than 20 percent of the state’s population, Chapin wasn’t surprised that it would see the most significant number of people wanting to prepay their bills.</span></p>
<p><span>To accommodate demand, the county has temporarily moved its tax payment services from the sixth floor of the Government Center in downtown Minneapolis to the skyway level, so people won’t have to go through weapons screening.</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond Hennepin, each of the metro area’s six other core counties also were experiencing an uptick in tax payments this week. Ramsey County had handled 893 prepayments since Tuesday, compared to 418 in 2016. Anoka and Dakota counties, which combined had collected nearly $8 million in property taxes, shifted staffers to handle the increased workload.</span></p>
<p><span>None of the metro counties beyond Hennepin extended the hours they will accept prepayments. But business was booming nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span>“My phone is blowing up,” said Pam LeBlanc</span><span>, Anoka County’s director of property records and taxation. “We are seeing double the amount of people who want to make early payments.”</span></p>
<p><span>Outstate, Wabasha County, on the Mississippi River southeast of the metro area, had taken in $100,000 in prepaid taxes by 2 p.m. Tuesday</span><span>; it collected $139,000 in prepaid taxes in all of 2016</span><span>. Olmsted County, also dealing with a steady stream of eager taxpayers, took in $600,000.</span></p>
<p><span>Dozens have called or e-mailed the St. Louis County Auditor’s Office this week wanting to pay their taxes early. Others have mailed in checks for the amount listed on their property tax statements, even though that amount is just an estimate based on the preliminary budgets of the various taxing jurisdictions; the actual amount due won’t be known until taxes are calculated and established in late February 2018.</span></p>
<p><span>“Our current cashiering and property tax software doesn’t allow us to provide a receipt showing that property taxes are prepaid,” said St. Louis County Auditor Don Dicklich.</span><span> “And it’s not possible for us to make that sort of procedural or software change in the final two weeks of the year. We can provide a receipt showing that we received a payment on a specific date, but not that the payment is for 2018 taxes.”</span></p>
<p><span>Other questions may arise, such as whether prepaying taxes might subject a taxpayer to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax. Chapin stressed that the county’s top priority is to make the taxpaying experience go as smoothly as possible rather than address specific tax concerns. Dicklich said that officials can’t give legal advice on whether early payment will help a person’s tax situation, or offer early refunds if it doesn’t benefit the county.</span></p>
<p><span>“I would recommend a person consult a professional tax accountant for that advice,” Dicklich said.</span></p>
<p><span>As Hennepin officials developed a plan to handle the rush of taxpayers, Chapin said he ran things by several commissioners. Getting enough staffers together during the holidays wasn’t easy, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>There will be some overtime costs to cover staffers who are working extended hours, but Chapin said he expected that expense to be covered by the folks who park Saturday in the typically closed ramp.</span></p>
<p><span>The significant amount of prepayment money actually can create a potential investment income benefit, said County Administrator David Hough</span><span>. County funds are managed and invested in a diversified investment portfolio, he said.</span></p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Wild forward Zach Parise likely will play Thursday night with the American Hockey League Iowa Wild against the Rockford IceHogs in Des Moines.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>The last time <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Zach Parise</strong> was in the minors was during the 2004-05 NHL lockout.</p>
<p>Well, 12 years later, he’s making his triumphant return. </p>
<p>The veteran Wild forward likely will play Thursday night with the American Hockey League Iowa Wild against the Rockford IceHogs in Des Moines. Parise has been practicing with the big club recently as part of his recovery from a late October microdiscectomy surgery. </p>
<p>He missed most of training camp and all of season so far because of the injury and surgery, so now that he has recently gotten the OK for full contact, this will be his first game. </p>
<p>“Even on that eight-day trip, we practiced one time. When you’re not on a line, these guys have to get ready to play games, and when you’re not on a line, it’s tough to get reps,” Parise said Wednesday at Xcel Energy Center. “So I think this would probably be the best thing to move forward to go there, practice with them, play a game and go from there. </p>
<p>“I talked to a good friend of mine who missed camp as well and missed a good chunk of games, and he said in hindsight that he wished he had gone down and played some games and gotten in shape and then stepped in,” Parise said. </p>
<p>“It takes awhile to catch back up to the conditioning level, the endurance level that these guys are at. It doesn’t happen overnight, and you can skate by yourself as much as you want, but you have to get in those games and get those reps in. And so it just made the most sense that it would be a good starting point.” </p>
<p>Parise said after Thursday’s game, he plans to come back up to Minnesota and practice with the Wild on Friday. But that’s as far as he’s planned. Coach <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> Bruce Boudreau</strong> said he hoped to see Parise’s return sometime “very early in the new year.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m not doing the back-to-back, I know that,” Parise said, as Iowa also plays Friday at Rockford. “I did look at that, though, I did consider it, but we just thought we didn’t know how good of an idea that would be maybe to play and then hop on a bus for five hours and play the next night. Work a little slower than that.” </p>
<p>The Wild’s highest-paid star joked about packing his gear because he’d been “sent down,” but his memories from his last stint in the minors are actually pretty fond. </p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s changed a little bit since then,” Parise said. “It was awesome. The league was really good. It was, I’m not joking. Each team had probably six or seven [NHL] regulars.” </p>
<h3><strong>Pitlick party</strong></h3>
<p>At least for one night, one Pitlick has a chance to upstage the other in Minnesota </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tyler Pitlick</strong>, a former Centennial High School standout, will play in his home state Wednesday as a forward for the Dallas Stars. But these days, it’s usually his younger cousin <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Rem Pitlick</strong>, a sophomore forward for the Gophers, who snags the spotlight.</p>
<p>“Our family’s a hockey family, and it’s definitely cool to see him doing so well,” Tyler Pitlick said. “I mean, I think he’s leading in goals and points over there … drafted by Nashville. And it’ll be pretty cool to get to play against him some day.” </p>
<p>Pitlick said he texts with his cousin every now and then, mostly when Rem asks him for advice on how to balance school and hockey. Pitlick joked that he’s not actually the best source for that, since he lasted only a season at Minnesota State. But according to Pitlick, Rem is one of the most hard working and dedicated players he’s seen, so he should be just fine. </p>
<p>Tyler Pitlick, who joined the Stars from Edmonton this past summer, said he wasn’t sure if his cousin would be one of the 50 or so family and friends coming to see the game against the Wild on Wednesday. But Pitlick already has received probably the most Minnesota welcome of all since he’s been home throughout the Christmas break. </p>
<p>“It was minus-5, and I got together with a couple buddies yesterday and got out on the outdoor rink to get my legs moving,” Pitlick said. “That’s the part that I think’s so special.” </p>
<h3><strong>Hanzal’s back</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s how <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Martin Hanzal</strong> summed up his time with the Wild: “It was short.”</p>
<p>Well, he was only here for a grand total of 20 games last season after a February trade from the Arizona Coyotes. And while it lasted just a few months before he signed with Dallas this past summer, the veteran winger said he still remembers how the fans were so into every small play. </p>
<p>With a rival team now in the stacked Central Division, Hanzal said he’s enjoyed being one of several additions who have helped reshape the Stars. </p>
<p>“It’s a lot of new stuff, you know, a lot of new tactics,” Hanzal said. </p>
<p>“And even the older guys like [ <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jason</strong>] <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Spezza</strong>, <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jamie</strong> [<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Benn</strong>], [<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tyler Seguin</strong>], they were here, but the new coach, he brought in all new stuff.</p>
<p>“So you have to adapt to that. But I think we are lately playing better, so it’s been fun.” </p>
<h3><strong>Etc.</strong></h3>
<p>• Winger <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Nino Niederreiter</strong> still is out because of a foot or ankle injury he endured before the break. He did not practice Wednesday. But Boudreau said he was hopeful the forward would practice Thursday.</p>
<p>• Goaltender <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Devan Dubnyk </strong>did practice Wednesday and was on the bench as the backup for <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Alex Stalock </strong>in the Dallas game. Dubnyk likely will play at some point this weekend after missing six games because of a lower-body injury.</p>

                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Sam Bradford</strong> is expected to return to Vikings practice next week, according to coach <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Mike Zimmer</strong>, which is a step toward the veteran quarterback possibly being activated from injured reserve during the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Vikings placed Bradford on injured reserve Nov. 8, a day after he underwent surgery on his ailing left knee. The operation reportedly cleaned up cartilage and smoothed a bone spur, per ESPN’s <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Chris Mortensen</strong>.</p>
<p>“He’s been working out, doing things, getting on the field,” Zimmer said Wednesday. “He’s throwing the ball, doing workouts. I haven’t seen him. I’ve seen him, but I haven’t seen him work out.” </p>
<p>Bradford was first eligible to return to Vikings practice last week, when he reached the required six-week stay on injured reserve. But the Vikings will hold him out of practice until next week, when he’s actually eligible to return to play. </p>
<p>With a win Sunday against the Bears, the Vikings earn the NFC’s No. 2 seed and first-round bye, giving the coaching and athletic training staffs extra time to assess Bradford’s possible return in the playoffs. </p>

<p>“We’ll see when he practices,” Zimmer said. </p>
<p>Bradford, whose contract expires in March, has played six quarters for the Vikings this season. Two quarters came after he injured his left knee — which has previously undergone two ACL repairs — while starring in the Week 1 win against the Saints. He returned in Week 5 in Chicago, looking unable to move well while taking four sacks and completing five of 11 passes for 36 yards. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Case Keenum</strong> replaced Bradford 25 seconds before halftime in Chicago and led the Vikings to a 20-17 win. Keenum is 10-3 as the Vikings’ starter this season.</p>
<h3><strong>New play-caller is an option again</strong></h3>
<p>Zimmer again is considering handing off defensive play calling to coordinator <strong style="font-weight: 500;">George Edwards</strong> after this season ends. Zimmer considered the switch last offseason when evaluating ways he could be a better head coach on game days.</p>
<p>“He really does everything for me, other than I call the plays on Sunday,” Zimmer said during a conference call with Chicago reporters on Wednesday. “But I may change that next year.” </p>
<p>This is Zimmer’s 18th NFL season calling plays, which he’s alluded to as one of his strengths. The numbers back that up. The Vikings are the NFL’s No. 1 scoring defense entering the final regular-season game. Minnesota has ranked no worse than 11th since hiring Zimmer. </p>
<p>“You know, I don’t know,” Zimmer said when asked why he’d delegate play calling. “It’s a lot of work when you sit down and do it. I’ve done it for a long time. And because I have confidence in George, as well. I think maybe just the fact that, um, you know, I don’t know — I guess I’m just getting older.” </p>
<h3><strong>Elflein held out </strong></h3>
<p>Center <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Pat Elflein</strong> was unable to practice Wednesday because of a left shoulder injury that has bothered him since the Vikings’ Dec. 3 win in Atlanta. Elflein missed one game and has started twice since.</p>
<p>Defensive tackle <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Shamar Stephen</strong> (ankle), long snapper <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kevin McDermott</strong> (shoulder) and cornerback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tramaine Brock</strong> (foot) were also held out of practice. Tight end <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kyle Rudolph</strong> (ankle) and cornerback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Terence Newman</strong> (non-injury) were limited.</p>
<h3><strong>Smith honored</strong></h3>
<p>Safety <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Harrison Smith</strong> was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week after he led the Vikings with eight tackles and two interceptions in Green Bay. It’s Smith’s first such honor of his career and the Vikings’ eighth defensive player of the week award in four seasons under the current coaching staff.</p>

<p>Gift wrap from weeks of celebrations has been tossed. Our house is in relatively good order. Traffic to work remains temporarily (and blessedly) light. </p>
<p>It’s time, thus, to revisit one of my favorite annual traditions: reviewing a year’s worth of columns to catch up with folks whose stories I’ve told here. This year is unusual, because a few updates reach back to columns I wrote long ago. That’s the sweetness of a job like this. People keep in touch to share their good news, and their sorrows, too. </p>
<p>I begin with thanks to you, readers, for stepping up, as you always do in amazing ways. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jessica Rogers</strong>, the gregarious executive director of <a href="https://www.c2iyouth.org/">Connections to Independence </a>(C2i), has received about $23,000 in donations, plus “an awesome volunteer,” and a 2017 15-person van, paid for by a corporate donor. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-who-age-out-of-foster-care-can-still-find-help-with-life-skills/442404273/">Her organization</a> provides stability and independent living skills to youths aging out of foster care.</p>
<p>Low-income women busting through glass ceilings, and <a href="">building entire heating systems</a>, got a massive boost when a donor gave Dunwoody’s <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Women in Technical Careers </strong><a href="http://www.dunwoody.edu/women/">(WITC)</a> a $100,000 infusion in November.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Project Teddy Bear </strong>was inundated with yarn for inmates at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sandstone, Minn.

<h3>Everyday heroes </h3>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Hanadi Chehabeddine </strong>continues to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rosenblum-muslim-bridge-builder-urges-us-to-fight-fear-ask-questions/364394821/">build bridges as a speaker and diversity trainer </a>on Muslim issues. “Unity comes with understanding and empathy,” said Chehabeddine, who launched her own company, <a href="https://www.hanadispeaksout.com/copy-of-about">Hanadi SBC,</a> this year. “That’s what I try to accomplish by telling my story as a Muslim in America.”</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Peter Izmirian</strong> moved to South Dakota, but the 68-year-old still returns regularly to the Twin Cities to donate platelets. Izmirian told me he <a href="http://www.startribune.com/so-much-taken-from-minnesota-man-yet-still-he-chooses-to-give/407967926/">donates blood </a>because he wants to give back, despite being on a limited income. He donated his 75th gallon with Memorial Blood Centers on Nov. 1.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Joanne Labernik</strong> called with the happy news that seniors distraught over the closing of the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-seniors-who-lost-their-center-make-halloween-call-for-help/453094283/">Skyway Senior Center</a> in March have not one, but two places to call home-away-from-home. Westminster Presbyterian Church and the Downtown Central Library will together operate a senior center every morning, Monday through Thursday, starting in March. Westminster will host in its newly opened wing on Tuesday and Thursday; the library on Monday and Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Pickle maven Doris Rubenstein’s</strong> consciousness-raising effort regarding the Minnesota State Fair Creative Activities food competition continues. “A Pickle,” the play based on her <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local-pickle-maker-gets-rejected-from-minnesota-state-fair-competition-wins-a-play/438154993/">fight for kosher dill justice</a>, will be performed Jan. 22 at the St. Louis Park Sabes Jewish Community Center during its Twin Cities Jewish Humor Fest.</p>
<p>I was disappointed to hear that writer and feminist <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Brenda Ueland’s</strong> home in southwest Minneapolis did not avoid demolition, despite <a href="http://www.startribune.com/there-s-a-big-battle-to-save-author-brenda-ueland-s-little-house-in-linden-hills/414663393/">a robust preservation</a> effort by many. A three-story condo is being considered for the site. Perhaps the developer will at least nod to her literary contributions with a Little Free Library posted outside.</p>
<h3>Burning issues </h3>
<p>As I write this, it does look like <strong style="font-weight: 500;">alimony deductions</strong> will be going away in the massive tax overhaul, but the effective date has been pushed back by a year to Dec. 31, 2018. While there may be some ability to preserve deductibility for pre-existing obligations modified after that date, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-divorce-lawyers-alimony-changes-would-shortchange-families/463937113/">this shortsighted change</a> is likely to create even more fighting by couples facing this difficult passage.</p>
<p>I’m still hearing your opinions on <strong style="font-weight: 500;">whether or not one should take off shoes</strong> when entering another’s home. Thank goodness I found a way to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/must-minnesota-party-guests-toe-the-line-on-requests-to-remove-shoes/464251223/">distract you from politics</a>! Most readers say they do de-shoe because it’s polite; others noted that this is standard in many other countries. But my favorite e-mail came from a reader recalling a party where she cleaned off her shoes, but kept them on, only to be followed around all evening by the host, wiping the floor with a paper towel after every step she took. Needless to say, she’ll be finding other parties.</p>
<h3>Saying goodbye </h3>
<p>We lost some quiet heroes this year. Among them is educator <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Elizabeth G. “Betty” Johnson,</strong> to whom I turned for decades when I wrote about the challenges and joys of raising gifted children. Johnson, who devoted 30 years to the Minnesota Council for the Gifted and Talented, was 86.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Robert B. Dalton</strong>, 94, taught elementary education in Minneapolis for 30 years, officially at least. In truth, he never stopped teaching. I met charming Dalton in 2011 when we featured him and his former student, Ann Hinrichs, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/bob-ann-a-lesson-in-life/115430834/">in “Duets,”</a> a feature celebrating unique friendships. There was nobody like her sixth-grade teacher, Hinrichs said, noting that the two became lifelong friends, meeting regularly for coffee and cream-filled Bismarcks.</p>
<p>“He led me on a path of discovery in that one single year that would forever affect my life.” Dalton helped the shy girl perform in front of a live audience as “Raggedy Rose,” and taught her how to make a box camera, which led to her passion for photography. On her wedding day years later, he pulled from his basement filing cabinet a poem she’d written in his class. “He remembered and treasured his students,” she said. Let’s all remember and treasure the teachers in our lives. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kevin Johnson</strong> was ecstatic to tell me that his two-year campaign to save the Wilderness Discovery Resort for the Disabled paid off for “all our disabled loved ones,” and one person in particular. His buddy, Kirk Williams, a U.S. Navy veteran with multiple sclerosis, accompanied the Johnsons to the 6.8-acre Canadian resort for years before it abruptly shut down. Johnson and his wife, Lorie, created a Facebook campaign, wrote editorials and collected more than 29,000 signatures to get <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rosenblum-advocate-won-t-retreat-in-effort-to-bring-friend-to-outdoors/383984381/">the resort reopened</a>. Johnson felt urgency to do so as Williams’ health declined. But it was Johnson who died suddenly Sept. 29 of a major stroke. He was 59. Williams moved to a foster home run by veterans. And a “Kevin’s Road to Paradise” ramp will be installed at the resort. Heartbroken Lorie calls it “a beautiful ending.”</p>
<h3>Simply grateful </h3>
<p>I’m going to leave you with <strong style="font-weight: 500;">leftovers</strong>. After I shared my concern with <a href="http://www.startribune.com/let-s-learn-to-love-leftovers-and-fight-food-waste/459403753/">how wasteful we’ve become with food</a>, a reader sent me this meaningful food for thought. “When I buy food over the counter,” he wrote (requesting anonymity), “I say thank you to the vendor because I know how wonderful it is that I live and buy in a country where food is plentiful and affordable and tasteful and healthy and politely served to me by someone working at little more than minimum wage. I also thank the person who sells me affordable clothes that look good, drugs that are pure and that work, a car we use all the time, and a house of worship in which I am welcome.”</p>
<p>I can’t top that, so I’ll just say thank you for your immeasurable generosity to others in our community. Thanks, too, for reading the Star Tribune (in any form you choose) and for writing to me. A healthy, happy and safe New Year to all. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Brinks wasn’t eating. Although green beans are among his favorite foods, he turned his nose up at two bowls of them placed around the Minnetonka house where the yellow Lab lives. </p>
<p>To help, canine massage therapist Heidi Hesse rubbed Brinks in a specific spot on his ankle, an acupressure point, to soothe his lower back, bladder and kidneys. After an hour of massage with Hesse, Brinks regained his appetite and chowed down on a bowl of the veggies. </p>
<p>Massage is just one of a growing body of alternative therapies that Mary Kelley and Mark Falstad, Brinks’ humans, employ to ease the 10-year-old dog’s stiff joints, jump-start his appetite and soothe his ailing liver. Acupuncture is another. </p>
<p>As people increasingly take a holistic approach to their health, they’re also looking to alternatives to conventional medical care for their nonhuman family members. That’s why a new breed of wellness services for dogs — from chiropractic and aromatherapy to Chinese herbs and psychic communication — is springing up in the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>“It stems from human stuff,” said Dr. Cathy Sinning of <a href="http://lakeharrietvet.com/">Lake Harriet Veterinary (­lakeharrietvet.com)</a>. “There’s more mainstreaming now because of people learning how it can help themselves.”</p>
<p>Almost a third of Americans seek out “complementary and alternative medicine” to enhance their medical care, according to studies by the Centers for Disease Control. That includes using natural products, such as fish oil to combat heart disease; engaging in mind and body practices, such as meditation and yoga; or other approaches such as herbal remedies, traditional Chinese medicine or homeopathic drugs. </p>

<p>More humans, it seems, want their pets to have the same options. </p>
<p>When Sinning and her husband, Jim, began practicing in south Minneapolis 20 years ago, they were among the few veterinarians in the area integrating chiropractic and herbal medicine into standard care. These days, Sinning said, “most clinics have someone on staff doing acupuncture.” </p>
<p>Courses for veterinarians to learn additional “modalities” have been booming over the past 15 years, said Dr. Barbara Hodges, a holistic veterinarian and veterinary adviser for the California-based Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association. </p>
<h3>Adding to, not replacing </h3>
<p>Hodges doesn’t view the interest in alternative therapies as a rejection of traditional veterinarian medicine, just a complement to it. </p>
<p>“It’s simply enlarging your horizons and the array of things you can offer to your patients,” she said. </p>
<p>For example, a drug that can help a dog with an ailment might also cause serious side effects. So some vets might recommend an herbal remedy or a diet-and-exercise plan to mitigate those effects. </p>
<p>Practitioners say alternative treatments can improve circulation or digestion, ease muscle and joint pain, help animals recover from injury or surgery and calm a host of behavioral issues. </p>
<p><a href="http://amywilliamsdelong.com/">Amy Williams DeLong</a>, a certified aromatherapist who specializes in working with animals, says aromatherapy can provide all of those benefits. Oils of herbs and roots that are known to ease pain travel by scent, and in a dog “are absorbed into the brain and bloodstream in less than a second,” she said.</p>
<p>At a recent appointment in Shoreview, DeLong let 8½-year-old German shepherd Izzy sniff a canvas tote filled with small bottles of essential oils. Izzy seemed to choose cinnamon and ginger by repeatedly licking the caps of the bottles. DeLong said those scents indicated that Izzy wanted a “warming” fragrance to help with circulation. </p>
<p>“We’re going to make you a holiday blend,” she told Izzy. </p>
<p>Izzy’s human, Julie Northenscold, was looking for something to alleviate her dog’s arthritis. </p>
<p>On DeLong’s instructions, Northenscold sprays a custom scent in her home or rubs it into her hands and then onto Izzy’s coat. Northenscold said that the scents have proved more effective than other medicines. The scents also help Izzy, who is deaf, find her owner. An initial aromatherapy session with DeLong (amywilliamsdelong.com) costs $65. </p>
<p>Training and certification for holistic pet practitioners vary widely. Some are veterinarians, such as animal acupuncturists, who are required in Minnesota to have a veterinary degree. Pet massage therapists don’t need any certification in Minnesota. But Hesse, Brinks’ massage therapist, trained at the Chicago School of Canine Massage. Her work requires a deep understanding of dog anatomy, she said. An initial consultation with her <a href="http://soundhoundmassage.com/">Sound Hound Canine Massage (soundhoundmassage.com)</a> runs $80.</p>
<p>Still, most practitioners caution pet owners to work with trained professionals and not to try DIY remedies found on the internet. </p>
<h3>‘Out there’ remedies </h3>
<p>In addition to more familiar treatments, there are other, less common pet care methods available. </p>
<p>Elaine Garley is a holistic practitioner who communicates telepathically with animals. Clients send her a photo of their pet along with questions they want her to ask (packages start at $39 for three questions). Garley then writes back with a “transcript” of the conversation. </p>
<p>“I get a running conversation in my head just like we’re talking on the phone,” said Garley, whose Minneapolis company is called <a href="http://animalbridges.com">Animal Bridges (animalbridges.com)</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, a client with a cat who was howling hired Garley. “As soon as I connected with the cat, I had a sinus headache,” indicating that was what was ailing the cat, Garley said. </p>
<p>Hesse, the massage therapist, hired Garley to “speak” to her sheepdog before it died, and then again afterward. </p>
<p>“It’s a little out there, even for me, but it was still comforting to hear what Lulu said,” Hesse said, tearfully. “I think there is something to it.” </p>
<p>With <a href="http://lenaswanson.com/">Lena Swanson</a>, another local animal communicator, people describe their pets during a phone call and explain their concerns. Swanson then places them on hold while she communicates telepathically with the animal. She charges $2.75 per minute for her services. (<a href="http://">lenaswanson.com</a>)</p>
<p>Clients come to her to understand why a cat stopped using its litter box, or ask a sick pet if it’s time to let go. </p>
<p>“It sounds so outlandish,” Swanson said, but she said she believes that animal communication is an important skill many people can learn to tap into. Next month, she is <a href="http://lenaswanson.com/2018-01-27-plan-ahead-animal-communication-weekend">teaching a course</a> for anyone interested in trying it themselves.</p>
<p>“A lot of people don’t hear words; they just get a gut sense of knowing what animals say,” Swanson said. “It’s the hardest thing to trust.” </p>
<h3>‘Part of our family’ </h3>
<p>Not all pets come to holistic care through their humans; sometimes it works the other way. </p>
<p>After seeing the reviving effects of acupuncture and massage on Brinks, Kelley and Falstad are considering trying it themselves. Kelley has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair to get around. (Brinks is her service dog.) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, they’ll continue to give their pets every option they can to live comfortably, from mainstream veterinary medicine to the hands-on healing that practitioners such as Hesse offer. </p>
<p>“People might think this is frivolous, but they’re a part of our family,” Kelley said. “They’ve given us so much. We can give something back.” </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Buzz Aldrin, center, models pieces from his collaborative collection with Sprayground, a youth-oriented street wear label.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>If anyone can restore proper awe to the notion of space travel, Buzz Aldrin can. At 87, Aldrin, who made history in 1969 when he set foot on the moon, has hung onto his plain-as-folk charm and easy, infectious enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Those attractions may well factor into pop culture’s resurrected romance with the pioneering astronaut, who raised his profile in recent years with guest spots on shows including “The Simpsons” and “Dancing With the Stars,” and an appearance at the Summer Olympics in Rio last year. In November, Aldrin led the annual Veterans Day parade in New York City, serving as grand marshal. </p>
<p>Unstoppable, it seems, he recently embarked on yet another life chapter: Last winter, he strode the runway of menswear designer Nick Graham, showing off a silver foil jacket with distinctly aerodynamic loft. So it may have been only a matter of time before Aldrin made the leap to a mainstream brand. </p>
<p>This fall, Sprayground, a youth-oriented streetwear label, enlisted this all-American hero to give a shout-out to its wares. And, improbable though it may seem, Aldrin, an outspoken proponent of travel to Mars, attached his name, and his myth, to a “Mission to Mars” fashion capsule collection of coats, duffels, backpacks and the rugged like. </p>
<p>“Buzz was the man who gave us a taste of space in the ’60s,” said David Ben-David, Sprayground’s founder and chief executive. “We thought it would be cool to see where his head’s at now.” </p>
<p>Aldrin, a space evangelist preaching the gospel of interplanetary travel through his Space Share Foundation, said he had little practical input into the products’ design. Their value, he maintained, is less in pushing the wares than in promoting a vision. </p>
<p>“The idea of flying around in space, even though it seems a little far out, certainly catches young people’s attention,” he said in a phone interview. “Especially when you jazz it up by carrying a briefcase that lights up in your hands.” </p>
<p>This quirky rag-trade partnership resonates for sure in the popular culture, which is celebrating its own astral moment. The notion of space travel appears to be exerting a new hold on people’s imaginations, seducing with the promise of a fresh start on unsullied terrain. </p>
<p>“Everything streams from the zeitgeist,” said Daniel H. Wilson, a robotics engineer and author of science fiction novels such as “A Clockwork Dynasty” and “Robogenesis.” In the world of sci-fi publishing, he said, there has been tendency to forsake gloom-and-doom scenarios in favor of more exhilaratingly upbeat fare. The objective, it seems, is to revive the optimism of the late 1960s, when the promise of adventure and discovery — and the reality of a lunar landing — spawned a generalized blue-sky optimism. </p>
<p>That mood contrasts mightily with the one of the moment. In a currently divisive, often chaotic sociopolitical climate, “space exploration offers a vision of escape that’s really appealing,” Wilson said. “If reality is dystopia, why shouldn’t our dreams turn utopic?” </p>
<p>Fashion is celebrating its own return to the galaxies. Past expeditions included those of Karl Lagerfeld, Rick Owens and Christophe Decarnin of Balmain, who nearly a decade ago cast a wistful backward glance at the swashbuckling universe of space-traveling superheroes, a universe earlier explored by André Courrèges, Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin. </p>
<p>Somehow their vision persists. This year, Alessandro Michele of Gucci introduced fall advertising images of UFOs and beam-me-up-Scotty teleportation platforms. Lagerfeld, in his fall show, offered the spectacle of a simulated rocket launch to highlight a collection of sparkle tights, dresses and cap-toe boots, and a silver Mylar space blanket. Last spring, Stuart Vevers of Coach, no laggard in this latest fashion space race, unveiled a retro-futuristic capsule collection of NASA-themed handbags, light jackets and sweatshirts. “The collection is very nostalgic,” Vevers said at the time. “There’s something about the time of the space program that just gives this feeling of possibility.” His cosmic references, he said, “are symbolic of a moment of ultimate American optimism and togetherness.” </p>
<p>But the appeal of the cosmos isn’t all nostalgia — at least if you believe the battery of entrepreneurs intent on boldly going where few have gone before. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, who aims to ship colonists to Mars in a decade, said he plans to send two tourists on a flight around the moon as early as next year. </p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has reached deep into his pockets to finance his rocket company, Blue Origin. And Robert D. Richards, chief executive of Moon Express, has conceived a business plan intended, he said, “to expand Earth’s economic sphere to the moon and beyond.” </p>
<p>Aldrin, who predicts settlements on Mars by 2040, has loftier aims, some founded on his indelible recollections. “You’ll always remember the times when you launch and when you’re in a coasting condition — zero gravity,” he said. “There is the view of other spacecraft that you’re close to, and, of course, the landing, touching down on soil that in hundreds of thousands of years has been ground to a little fine dust. </p>
<p>“You can’t find anything like that here on Earth. It is exciting to see something that is so absolutely un-reproducible.” </p>
<p>He hopes to inspire a youthful generation, “obsessed,” in his phrase, with “the short-term payoff,” to participate in a larger, more ennobling scheme. While not technically suited for space exploration, his backpacks and solar-panel flight jackets serve metaphorical function, he said, to remind wearers that they are but fragments in a whole, “members of a team, part of something bigger than themselves.” </p>
<p>Ben-David of Sprayground wants to share in that dream. But for now, he said: “My goal is to make the ultimate backpack. And the ultimate backpack is a jet pack.” </p>

<p>Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer is again considering handing off defensive play calling to coordinator George Edwards, however only after this season ends. </p>
<p>Zimmer considered the switch last offseason, saying he was evaluating ways he could be a better head coach on game days. </p>
<p>“[Edwards] really does everything for me, other than I call the plays on Sunday,” Zimmer said during a conference call with Chicago reporters on Wednesday. “But I may change that next year.” </p>
<p>The NFL’s Career Development Advisory Panel recently distributed its list of annual head-coaching candidates, which reportedly included both Vikings coordinators Edwards and Pat Shurmur. </p>
<p>“George does everything,” Zimmer said. “He helps with the game plan. He runs a lot of the meetings, the defensive meetings. Him and I really sit down and talk about all the different things that are going on. He studies the game just like he’s calling the game. So he’ll come in and talk to me about second down-and-whatever. ‘They’re doing this,’ or, ‘they’re doing that.’ Really, he does everything other than call the game on Sunday.” </p>
<p>Edwards last called defensive plays full-time in 2011 for the Bills. He stepped in for Zimmer and called defensive plays during the Vikings’ 17-15 loss to the Cowboys last season, when the defense played well. </p>
<p>This is Zimmer’s 18th NFL season calling plays, which he’s alluded to as one of his strengths. The numbers prove it. </p>
<p>The Vikings are the NFL’s No. 1 scoring defense entering the final regular season game. Minnesota has ranked no worse than 11th since hiring Zimmer. </p>
<p>“You know, I don’t know,” Zimmer said when asked why he’d delegate play calling. “It’s a lot of work when you sit down and do it. I’ve done it for a long time. And because I have confidence in George, as well. I think maybe just the fact that, um, you know, I don’t know – I guess I’m just getting older.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>For Eric Fischer, not knowing hurts the most. </p>
<p>Since his son was critically wounded in a police shooting at Minneapolis City Hall last week, Fischer says he’s been allowed little contact with Marcus Fischer, 18, who is still recovering from self-inflicted stab wounds and police bullets. </p>
<p>Hospital officials have not disclosed details about his son’s condition, he said. What little information he’s been able to pry out of authorities has left him feeling empty. He learned from a psychiatrist who interviewed Marcus that he was up and walking around. He said he could only wonder what must have been going through Marcus’ mind. Police say the younger Fischer brought a knife into an interview room and stabbed himself repeatedly, after being left unattended. </p>
<p>“I didn’t raise my son to be like this, so I don’t really have a comment on what his mental state was,” he said. </p>
<p>Eric Fischer brought his pain to court on Friday and Tuesday to watch what should have been Marcus’ first appearance on charges that he robbed and shot a man during a gun deal gone awry in northeast Minneapolis earlier this year. But both times the hearing was pushed back a day, because he wasn’t yet well enough to leave the hospital. No one told Fischer. On Wednesday, Hennepin County prosecutors announced that Marcus Fischer’s court date was again rescheduled to Jan. 3. </p>
<p>Eric Fischer said he did not learn of the shooting until late Monday morning when his daughter called him at work, after seeing a post about Marcus on social media. </p>

<p>On his first visit to Marcus’ room at Hennepin County Medical Center last Saturday, Eric said he was kept from approaching Marcus’ bed by a sheriff’s deputy who stayed in the room the whole time. Another three deputies were stationed outside the door, he said. </p>
<p>“They wanted to make sure I didn’t share any information about the case; they wanted to make sure I didn’t touch my son,” Eric Fischer said. “I just wanted to give him a hug and kiss on the forehead, to make sure he knows that I’m here for him.” </p>
<p>His son had just emerged from surgery to repair a deep gash to his throat, Eric Fischer said, and wasn’t able to speak. Fischer said he can now see his son during regular inmate visiting hours on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. </p>
<p>The sheriff’s office said it is following procedure with limited visits. </p>
<p>“If somebody’s in our custody and they are being treated at HCMC, our policy doesn’t allow for visitors except for under special circumstances,” said spokesman Jon Collins. But, he said, exceptions are made occasionally, “if we believe that it’s in the best interests of the inmate’s health and wellness.” </p>
<p>“These policies are in place for both inmates’ safety and security, as well as the safety and security of our deputies, as well as the general public,” Collins said. </p>
<p>The hospital has stated that per policy it can’t release information about a patient in police custody. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Eric Fischer and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/after-outcry-relatives-of-man-shot-by-minneapolis-police-demand-visitation/466687053/">a group of supporters marched</a>, first to County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office and then the Sheriff’s Office headquarters at City Hall, to demand that the family be allowed to visit Marcus without supervision in the hospital. A supporter has started an online fundraiser for Marcus Fischer’s hospital expenses at <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/marcus-fischer-medical-fund">gofundme.com/marcus-fischer-medical-fund</a>.</p>
<p>Mary Moriarty, the county’s chief public defender, said that her office had been assigned to Marcus’ criminal case — in which he faces charges of first-degree assault, first-degree robbery and possession of a handgun by a prohibited person. </p>
<p>She clarified that a public defender would be representing Marcus only in his criminal case, and not in any civil action that springs from the City Hall shooting. </p>
<p>After his arrest Dec. 18 on suspicion of involvement with a robbery and shooting, Fischer was brought to police headquarters for questioning. </p>
<p>At one point, he was left unattended in an interview room when the case detectives got up to get him some water. When they returned, sources say Fischer was cutting himself with a large folding knife that he brought into the room in his waistband and tried to slash his own throat. Officers tried to negotiate with Marcus, unsuccessfully using a Taser to subdue him, the sources said, then opened fire when he ignored orders to put the weapon down and started moving toward the door. </p>
<p>The two officers who fired their guns — Sgt. Gene Suker and officer Jerome Carey — <a href="http://www.startribune.com/robbery-suspect-shot-by-minneapolis-police-to-make-first-court-appearance/465942403/">are on routine paid leave</a> pending the outcome of a state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into the incident. So is officer David Martinson, who deployed the Taser. Officials said that metal-detecting wands will now be placed in every interview room at headquarters and at each of the five police precincts.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>A Roman Catholic priest on leave from two northwestern Minnesota parishes for 20 months amid an allegation of sexual misconduct with a 15-year-old boy returned to public ministry in time to celebrate Christmas. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.crookston.org/offices/bishop/from-the-bishop/741-december-23-2017-statement-of-the-diocese-of-crookston-re-reinstatement-of-fr-pat-sullivan">statement</a> posted on the Diocese of Crookston website Saturday, Bishop Michael Hoeppner said its clergy abuse review panel scrutinized a deposition given by the accuser in a lawsuit “and deemed the allegations not credible.”</p>
<p>The diocese statement also pointed out that local and federal authorities investigated the allegations and that “no criminal charges were filed.” No other accusations have been leveled against the Rev. Patrick Sullivan, who has denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Sullivan returned to his work at the same parishes where he had been before, St. Elizabeth’s in Dilworth and St. Andrew’s in Hawley, said the Rev. Mike Foltz of the Crookston diocese. </p>
<p>“He was there for Christmas,” Foltz said. “The people were ecstatic, from the children to the parents to the grandparents. They swarmed him with love and affection and hugs.” </p>
<p>His accuser, now an adult, said that the sexual misconduct occurred more than eight years ago, when Sullivan was pastor at St. Mary’s Mission Church in Red Lake. </p>
<p>The diocese panel, called the Board of Review for the Protection of Children and Young People, is composed of two social workers, a county sheriff, a police detective, an attorney and a diocesan priest. </p>
<p>The board’s ruling was unanimous, Foltz said. </p>
<p>Foltz declined to reveal the identities of the board members, saying that he didn’t want them “to get calls from the media.” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.andersonadvocates.com/Posts/News-or-Event/2196/News-Release-Diocese-of-Crookston-Wrongly-Reinstates-Priest-Accused-of-Child-Sexual-Abuse.aspx">Jeff Anderson</a>, the St. Paul attorney representing the plaintiff, said Wednesday that Sullivan’s reinstatement is a “reckless” act that “poses a threat of harm to children.”</p>
<p>Anderson, who has represented many victims of clergy abuse in legal actions from the parish level all the way to the Vatican, said, “There is information that has not been made known to the public that is in Bishop Hoeppner’s possession that demonstrates that this diocese and Hoeppner are doing the wrong thing again.” </p>
<p>Anderson cautioned that the suit, filed on behalf of Doe 457, remains active and the plaintiff and the defendant continue to exchange information about the case. </p>
<p>The attorney went on to say that his firm has received information that Hoeppner received notice that Sullivan “posed a serious risk of harm” before Doe 457 came forth with his allegations. </p>
<p>Foltz said the diocese is unaware of any other troubling information concerning Sullivan, “otherwise, we wouldn’t put him back in the ministry.” </p>
<p>The diocese statement concluded by stating that it “takes any and all accusations of sexual misconduct by clergy very seriously.” </p>
<p>It then urged that anyone with knowledge of sexual misconduct involving the Diocese of Crookston to contact its victim’s assistance coordinator at 218-281-7895. </p>
<p>Since 2014, Crookston has released the names of six other priests credibly accused of sexually molesting minors. The diocese has also acknowledged similar allegations against a now-retired priest, Roger Grundhaus. </p>
<p>More than 500 claims of sex abuse by Minnesota clergy have been made in the past four years, most through a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/more-than-800-sex-abuse-claims-filed-under-minnesota-law/380524441/">law</a> that allowed older civil cases to be filed over a three-year period that ended in 2016.</p>
<p>Catholic leaders have said that the abuse scandal is in the past, and that reforms have been made. </p>

<p>Chuck &amp; Don’s, the pet-supplies store, is adding a 40th store in January, at 50th and France Avenue in Edina. <br> Chuck &amp; Don’s will open a small shop of 2,300 square feet, which includes a pet-grooming studio, its third. <br> The store also will sell a limited selection of pet food and other products.<br> “We’re thrilled to join the [Edina] business community in 2018,” said CEO Bob Hartzell. “We jumped at the opportunity to lease the available space for our 29th retail location [in Minnesota] and are excited to expand by welcoming the [Edina-store] grooming duo to the Chuck &amp; Don’s team.”<br> Chuck &amp; Don’s operates 10 locations in Colorado, 28 stores in Minnesota and one in Wisconsin. <br> Chief Financial Officer Thomas Murphy said Chuck &amp; Don’s opened four Minnesota stores this year and that the company expects revenue this year to grow to “in excess of $70 Million.”<br> Hartzell, 64, and co-owner Chuck Anderson, 76, of the 27-year-old company, are in the fourth year of selling their ownership to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.<br> It is funded gradually, out of the employee portion of pretax profits.<br> “ESOP” proponents say that they are a great way for employees to gain ownership and wealth from a growing business. That is if the owners are willing to “get rich slowly,” through a staged, conservative buyout. Hartzell said this fall that he and Anderson chose the ESOP route over higher cash-out transactions to a competitor or financial buyer, such as a private equity shop.</p>

<p>Airplane food tends to be more of a punchline than a pleasure. And yet, at 35,000 feet, even a forlorn-looking tray can serve as both entertainment and sustenance for a captive audience. With that in mind, Charles Platkin, director of the New York City Food Policy Center at Hunter College, sought to uncover just how healthy or unhealthy airplane food is, and the results are published in the Annual Airline Food Investigation, a survey he’s conducted since 2000 (it became annual in 2009). </p>
<p>For the survey, Platkin reached out to representatives with 12 major airlines to inquire about their meal and snack options. He ranks them based, in part, on calories, nutrition, menu innovation and transparency (some airlines are more candid than others about what’s in their food). </p>
<p>“They call me an airline food bully,” says Platkin, who is also founder of the site DietDetective.com. “I’m aggressive about it. People have choices about what airline they fly, but they don’t have choices about what they eat on that flight,” he says. </p>
<p>Each airline is given a “health score” on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest. This year, Delta and Virgin America tied for the lead, with each scoring 4 points, and Air Canada tied for second with JetBlue. Hawaiian Airlines came in last. </p>
<p>It’s telling that no airline scored the highest rating of 5. “The airlines still have a tremendous amount of room for improvement,” says Platkin. “No airline blows me away, like, ‘Oh my gosh, they got it.’ ” To that end, he was more inclined to use phrases such as “not awful” when describing a meal or snack, rather than showering it with praise. While a handful of those surveyed serve complimentary meals on select flights (Delta, American and Hawaiian), Platkin is more inclined to encourage health-conscious passengers to eat a full meal before they fly and to carry their own snacks (nuts, fruit, vegetables, hummus) onboard. </p>
<p>Here’s how the 12 airlines scored, along with some of the “Best bets” to munch on from each. ( <a href="http://www.dietdetective.com/annual-airline-food-investigation-2017-18/">Click here</a> for the full survey and more “best bets” and nutritional info.)</p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Delta</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Excellent </p>
<p>Health score: 4 stars </p>
<p>Average calories overall (meals, snack boxes and individual snacks): 480 </p>
<p>Delta was notable for its willingness to share nutritional information, its variety of offerings and the fact that the average calories in the snack boxes, meals and individual snacks decreased from 2016’s 527 to 480, and meal calories decreasing from 628 calories to 559. Delta has also begun offering complimentary meals in economy class on select flights. </p>
<p>Best bets: For a snack, opt for the almonds (124 calories); the vegan, GMO-free Delta Flight Fuel Tapas Snack Box (it should be eaten as a meal, not a snack, because of the higher calories, says Platkin), which has Super Seed Crackers, Snapea Crisps, almonds, hummus, quinoa with pepper dip and other items (665 calories); the fruit-and-yogurt continental breakfast (345 calories if you save the Kind bar for later); the sesame noodle salad (345 calories); or the Greek mezze plate (330 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Virgin America</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Excellent </p>
<p>Health score: 4 stars </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 340 </p>
<p>Platkin says that healthier options and openness about calories and nutrients have all been a part of Virgin’s approach since the airline launched (although it has since been purchased by Alaska Airlines). </p>
<p>Best bets: Go with the nuts as a snack (Creative Snack Brain Smart Nut Mix, 510 calories, and Hail Merry Seasoned Nut Blend, 220 calories) and share them or save part for later; opt for one of the meals, such as the 420-calorie, vegetarian protein-packed quinoa wrap; the 440-calorie protein plate with a cage-free hard-boiled egg, cheese, grilled chicken breast, fresh vegetables, wheat pita rounds and edamame hummus; or the 390-calorie farro salad. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Air Canada</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 3.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 320 </p>
<p>Best bets: Skotidakis fat-free vanilla Greek yogurt (90 calories); Avocado Smash Box with fresh guacamole, aged cheddar cheese, hard-boiled egg, green apple slices, multigrain muesli bread, chili flakes (590 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">JetBlue Airways</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Somewhat helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 3.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 337 </p>
<p>Best bets: Platkin highlights the Amp Up Box, with hummus, a fruit bar, olives, crackers, almonds and other items (425 calories) for its nutritional value, but acknowledges the calories are high. Other good choices on select flights: yogurt and granola (210 calories), kale and quinoa salad (320 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Alaska Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Extremely helpful </p>
<p>Health score 3.5 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 479.6 </p>
<p>Best bet: Platkin suggests sharing the Mediterranean Tapas Picnic Pack (vegan, kosher and gluten-free) or having it as a meal, because it’s 510 calories. It comes with multigrain snack chips, olives, hummus, almonds and more. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">United</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Somewhat helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 2.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 416 </p>
<p>Best bet: For a snack, go for the hummus (160 calories) or the Tapas Snack Box, which comes with a variety of items including flatbread, crackers, bruschetta, hummus, almonds, mints and more (avoid the cheese spread, says Platkin). The Mezze Sampler (501 calories), is another good option. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">American Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Below average </p>
<p>Health score: 2.5 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 446 </p>
<p>Best bets: Go for the hummus box as a snack (220 calories) or the Chicken Arugula Wrap (when available) for lunch and go easy on the dressing (401 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Frontier Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health Rating: 2.25 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 372 </p>
<p>Best bet: Snack options are fairly limited. Go for the Colorado Nut Co. Trail mix (393 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Southwest Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health Score: 2 </p>
<p>Average calories: 125 </p>
<p>Best Bet: Southwest offers a fairly limited selection, but the ones it does offer are complimentary. Peanuts (70 calories) are the best bet, says Platkin, even though the pretzels have lower calories. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Allegiant Air</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health Score: 1.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 402 </p>
<p>Best bets: The Nut Medley (680 calories) if shared with another person or portioned out; hummus and pita chips (150 calories). Platkin warns people away from the Wingz Kids Snack Pack (Oreos, baked Goldfish and Welch’s fruit snacks, 240 calories) and the Deli Snack Pack (Wheat Thins, cheese spread, almonds, Biscoff cookies, Slim Jim, 530 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Spirit Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 1.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 316 </p>
<p>Best bet: Hummus with pita chips (220 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Hawaiian Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Terrible/unresponsive </p>
<p>Health score: 1 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 568 </p>
<p>Platkin says that the airline representatives didn’t share nutritional information, so he and his team had to estimate in their findings. Hawaiian Airlines offers free meals, and the high calorie counts associated with them, which he found averaged 971 calories, worked against them in Platkin’s ratings. </p>
<p>Best bets: Hummus and pita chips (197 calories). Although Platkin writes in his report: “In the end, it would be best to eat before you board the plane; otherwise you might wind up feeling lethargic and cranky after one of these calorie-heavy meals. Just say no, and bring your own food.” </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">The income limits will change by about 2 percent based on inflation.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Nicole Norfleet</h4>
<p>The Minnesota Department of Revenue has shifted the state’s individual income tax brackets for next year based on inflation. </p>
<p>For the 2018 tax year, the state’s tax brackets will change about 2 percent from tax-year 2017, the department said on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The adjustment does not change the Minnesota tax rate that applies to each income bracket. Since 1979, there has been an annual adjustment of the brackets to take inflation into account. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><style type="text/css">.embed iframe{height:345px;} @media only screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 767px){.embed iframe {height:450px;}}</style></p>
<div><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="345" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1PcJF/1/" width="100%"></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>For example, for a single person, the income limit grew $500 to $25,890 to qualify for the lowest tax rate of 5.35 percent. The taxable income that pushes a single person into the top bracket, with a rate of 9.85 percent, increased $3,120 to $160,020. </p>
<p>Taxpayers who make quarterly payments on estimated taxes should use the new rate schedule to figure out payments, which are due starting next April. </p>
<p>Under new federal tax law, both brackets and rates have changed. The Internal Revenue Service is likely to publish the schedule in February. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">It is at least the third time a local worker has been accused since 2013.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Brandon Stahl</h4>
<p>An employee at the Eden Prairie Massage Envy faces two counts of third-degree sexual assault after being accused of molesting his clients while giving them massages. </p>
<p>Mitchell Le Dac Ho, 28, of Eden Prairie, is at least the third Massage Envy employee in the metro area <a href="http://www.startribune.com/edina-masseuse-charged-with-sex-assault/452565203/">to be charged with sexually assaulting a client</a> since 2013.</p>
<p>One of Ho’s clients told Eden Prairie police in March 2016 that he digitally penetrated her during a massage until she told him to stop, according to the criminal complaint. She paid for the session and left. She told police she was too afraid to tell anyone about what happened. As officers continued to investigate they lost contact with the woman, according to the charge, until they were able to find her again. </p>
<p>Ho was still working at the Eden Prairie franchise in September 2017 when he digitally penetrated a juvenile girl for five to 10 minutes, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>A district manager for the Eden Prairie Massage Envy referred questions to the company’s media relations department, which has not immediately responded for comment. </p>
<p>At least five Massage Envy clients have accused their massage therapists of assault in the last four years. John Earl Young II, 29, was charged in 2013 with molesting a client at a Minnetonka franchise in June that year. </p>
<p>The next month he was working at a Bloomington store when he sexually assaulted another client. He was convicted in both cases in 2015 and sentenced to half a year in jail. </p>
<p>In October, Matthew Ryan Perry, 41, of Hopkins, was charged with criminal sexual conduct after a client at the Edina store accused him of touching her vagina during a massage. His case is still pending. </p>
<p>Massage Envy has more than 1,000 franchises in the country, including 22 in the Twin Cities metro area, according to the company’s website. In a statement, the company said they are cooperating with law enforcement, and that Ho is no longer with the franchise. </p>
<p><span>“Safety in the treatment room is </span>– and always will be – our priority, and we believe our recently announced Commitment to Safety defines a clear path forward that will create meaningful change to ensure the safety and well-being of members and guests,” the statement said.</p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">In this Dec. 1, 2017 photo, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn leaves federal court in Washington.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>President Donald Trump’s legal team plans to cast former national security adviser Michael Flynn as a liar seeking to protect himself if he accuses the president or his senior aides of any wrongdoing, according to three people familiar with the strategy. </p>
<p>The approach would mark a sharp break from Trump’s previously sympathetic posture toward Flynn, whom he called a “wonderful man” when Flynn departed the White House in February. Earlier this month, the president did not rule out a possible pardon for Flynn, who is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. </p>
<p>Attorneys for Trump and his top advisers have privately expressed confidence that Flynn does not have any evidence that could implicate the president or his White House team. But since Flynn’s cooperation agreement with prosecutors was made public earlier this month, the administration has been strategizing how to neutralize him in case the former national security adviser does make any claims. </p>
<p>Flynn is the most senior former Trump adviser known to be providing information to Mueller’s team. The lenient terms of his plea agreement suggest he has promised significant information to investigators, legal experts said. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of lying to the FBI, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Prosecutors said they will recommend a sentence from zero to six months in prison as part of his cooperation deal. Flynn’s son, who served as his chief of staff, also faced the risk of criminal charges, according to people familiar with the plea negotiations, but was spared. </p>
<p>Trump’s legal team has seized on Flynn’s agreement with prosecutors as fodder for a possible defense, if necessary. In court filings, the retired lieutenant general admitted that he lied to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the December 2016 transition. </p>
<p>“He’s said it himself: He’s a liar,” said one person helping craft the strategy who was granted anonymity to describe private conversations. </p>
<p>Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, declined to comment. Ty Cobb, the White House attorney overseeing the response to the special counsel investigation, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Defense lawyers have said privately that Flynn will be unable to point to White House or campaign records turned over in the probe to bolster any claims of a criminal scheme. None of those records suggest a conspiracy by Trump or his inner circle to improperly work with Russians to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, according to people who have reviewed the documents. </p>
<p>The private talks about assailing Flynn’s credibility come even as Trump has signaled that a pardon is not off the table. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet,” the president said Dec. 15. “We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.” </p>
<p>Some of Flynn’s family members appear to be counting on Trump to act. On Tuesday, one of Flynn’s brothers tweeted a message urging the president to pardon his former adviser, responding to a tweet by Trump alleging bias in the FBI. </p>
<p>“Mr. President, I personally believe that a pardon is due to General Flynn, given the apparent and obvious illegitimacy of the manner in which the so called ‘crimes’ he plead guilty to were extracted from him,” Joseph Flynn wrote. “I ask for quick action on this. Thank you and keep up the good work!” </p>
<p>Joseph Flynn did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Outside legal experts said that discussing ways to undermine a possible witness is a natural first step for defense lawyers to consider. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty predictable,” said Randall Eliason, a former public corruption prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington. “Defense will always argue that a cooperator who lied previously should not be believed, and that there is insufficient evidence of the conspiracy. It’s Defense Strategy 101.” </p>
<p>He added: “How effective it would be depends entirely on the strength of the other evidence that the prosecution can present to prove its case and corroborate Flynn.” </p>
<p>Barbara Van Gelder, a veteran white-collar defense lawyer and former prosecutor, called it “textbook” for the defense team to raise doubts about Flynn’s version of events. </p>
<p>“They will pull out all the arguments: ‘You pleaded guilty. You don’t have anything more than your word, and you probably got your son off with this. You got the deal of the century,’ “ she said. </p>
<p>Securing documents that corroborate the statements of cooperators such as Flynn is often key when the case comes down to dueling accounts, legal experts said. </p>
<p>“People’s recollections can be faulty but … you can’t cross-examine a document,” Van Gelder said. “It is what it is.” </p>
<p>Exactly what Flynn might offer Mueller about what he saw inside the Trump operation remains a mystery. Van Gelder noted that in the way the special counsel structured Flynn’s plea agreement, prosecutors avoided sharing the guts of their ongoing investigation. </p>
<p>“That is what I thought was the brilliance of the Flynn plea,” she said. “It said: ‘I’m giving just enough to have the judge sentence you within the guidelines, but not giving anything to anybody else.’ “ </p>
<p>White House advisers have noted Flynn did not plead guilty to being a co-conspirator in any criminal scheme, which they argue shows he is not able to provide evidence of a larger conspiracy. </p>
<p>Some legal experts said prosecutors could still rely on Flynn’s testimony to allege such a scheme. However, others said persuading a jury to charge a conspiracy that did not include a key witness would be more difficult. </p>
<p>If Mueller opted not to charge him in a conspiracy, Van Gelder asked, “how much of a crime is it, really?” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Regions Hospital is seeking state approval for an expansion that officials say is needed to serve an aging population in a facility that is already near capacity. </p>
<p>By 2040, the large medical center in St. Paul said it wants to add 100 beds and the equivalent of 950 full-time workers, according to a filing this month with state regulators. The figures represent increases of more than 20 percent in the current bed and employee counts. </p>
<p>Ultimately, approval for the project must come from the Legislature, which hasn’t been asked for such a large expansion of medical/surgical beds and maternity capacity since it approved the construction of Maple Grove Hospital more than 10 years ago. </p>
<p>“Most of the moratorium exceptions that have been granted in the last 10 years or so have generally been for mental health care services,” said Matt Anderson, a senior vice president with the Minnesota Hospital Association. </p>
<p>Minnesota established in 1984 a moratorium that blocks the expansion of existing hospital capacity without legislative approval. Legislators were concerned about the possible impact on health care spending, since each licensed bed can represent a significant expense in terms of staffing, technology and use of health care services. </p>
<p>At Regions, hospital officials said they would not need to expand the footprint of its existing campus to accommodate much of the proposed growth. And they contend the expansion won’t add to overall health care costs, since Regions is part of the integrated system at Bloomington-based HealthPartners that includes a health insurance company and a commitment to holding down expenses. </p>
<p>Plans call for 60 new medical/surgical beds in space the hospital vacated as part of a campus expansion project that was completed in 2009. Another 20 beds would be placed on a vacant floor within the hospital’s new tower for mental health patients, which opened in 2012. </p>
<p>The remainder of the beds would be used for maternity care, with most allowing for better flow of patients through the unit as opposed to growth, said Heidi Conrad, the hospital’s chief financial officer. Separately, the hospital is considering a plan for building a new center for mothers and babies, said Megan Remark, the chief executive at Regions. </p>
<p>The proposal for more maternity space comes just a few months after St. Joseph’s Hospital, which also is located in downtown St. Paul, closed its unit. </p>
<p>That closure, plus population growth, leads Regions to believe the hospital “needs an additional two licenses to increase services for mothers and babies and 18 licenses to transform our model of care,” according to its filing this month with the Minnesota Department of Health. </p>
<p>Regions said it is unique among hospitals in downtown St. Paul in using more than 90 percent of its licensed beds — a ratio that hospital officials believe will increase to 100 percent next year. That contrasts with utilization rates of 72 percent at nearby United Hospital and 60 percent at St. Joseph’s Hospital, according to the regulatory filing. </p>
<p>“Regions is one of the only hospitals using all of our bed licenses,” Remark said. “The other hospitals in the immediate east metro have an opportunity to grow by putting more beds that they have licenses for into use.” </p>
<p>A spokesman for Minneapolis-based Allina Health System, which owns United, did not comment. A spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services, which owns St. Joseph’s, did not immediately comment. </p>
<p>The Regions proposal will be reviewed by the state Health Department, which will make a recommendation to legislators about whether the project is in the public interest. The hospital hopes the Legislature will pass a bill granting an exception to the moratorium during the 2018 session, which ends in May. </p>
<p>The goal would be to gradually renovate space to add beds, starting in about a year to 18 months, Remark said. The timeline for bringing all beds into service stretches to 2040, according to the regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Market-share figures from Regions show the hospital has been gaining patients in recent years, as market share has slipped for St. Joseph’s as well as St. John’s Hospital in Maplewood. Both of the Regions rivals were operated by St. Paul-based HealthEast until it merged into Fairview earlier this year in the wake of somewhat weakened financial performance. </p>
<p>Regions officials, however, downplay the magnitude of the recent market-share shifts, and said they don’t expect to grow going forward by taking patients from other hospitals. </p>
<p>“We truly believe that when you look at the data … you look at the population growth and the aging of the population, in total the east metro is going to need more beds,” said Conrad. “We think St. Joe’s and United are going to need to be a part of the solution.” </p>
<p>Health Department figures show that Regions in 2015 ranked eighth among the 10 largest hospitals in the state in the number of licensed beds, and had a relatively high utilization rate for those beds. At the time, seven of the state’s largest hospitals were using less than 75 percent of their licensed beds, while the ratio exceeded 90 percent for Regions and two others. </p>
<p>Overall, hospitals in Minnesota aren’t using about 30 percent of their licensed beds, said Anderson of the Minnesota Hospital Association. So, not many hospitals have been expressing frustration, he said, about their bed capacity. </p>
<p>At Regions, officials say they have been “running hot” for quite a while now — meaning operating with a high occupancy rate. </p>
<p>“Running hot is kind of our new normal,” said Remark, the hospital CEO. “Having a little bit of flexibility just continues to make sure that you can accommodate when volume spikes up.” </p>

The Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears 20-17 in an NFL Monday Night Football game on October 9, 2017 at Soldier Field in Chicago.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Asked to assess the significance of a victory over the Chicago Bears on Sunday — which would secure a first-round bye for the Vikings — tight end Kyle Rudolph paused, took a breath and proceeded to topple one of the NFL’s most banal clichés. </p>
<p>“I think this is the first time in my career where you can officially say a game counts as more than one,” Rudolph said. “Every week, we stand up here and say, ‘It’s one week. It’s one win. It’s one loss.’ This week counts as two wins, essentially. If we can go out and get a win, it guarantees us that we get next week off.” </p>
<p>There were enough Vikings players repeating some variation of the this-one-counts-double line Wednesday that it’s safe to assume they received it as a mantra from coach Mike Zimmer. And as the Vikings head into their regular-season finale against a 5-10 Bears team, it’s clear they will leave nothing to chance. </p>
<p>The Vikings (12-3) already have secured the NFC North title, and have a strong chance of clinching the conference’s No. 2 seed even if they lose to the Bears on Sunday. They’d secure a first-round bye with a Panthers loss, a Saints victory or Rams win in Week 17. </p>
<p>All three games that could provide help to the Vikings, though, are scheduled for late-afternoon starts Sunday, meaning Minnesota cannot watch the scoreboard to see if help is on the way during its game. </p>
<p>For the Vikings, it’s simple: Beat the Bears and get the bye. </p>

                  Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph wasn’t unveiled some new math when he pointed out the significance of Sunday’s season finale against Chicago.

<p>“When you get in the playoffs, you have a chance,” Zimmer said. “Whatever it is, whether it’s sixth seed or second seed, you have a chance. I think our guys feel good about that. This game is important and we need to win this game. If you go back through the history of the league, there’s been some [No.] 6 seeds that made it. But most of the time, these teams that only have to play a couple games to get to the big one, there’s a lot more of those.” </p>
<p>Since 2012, teams with first-round byes are 16-4 in the division round of the playoffs, and only one team in that time (the 2012 Ravens) has reached the Super Bowl without a first-round bye. </p>
<p>Put in those terms, the trade is relatively simple; Instead of resting starters this week, the Vikings can work hard in a regular-season game and swap a hard-fought playoff game for a week of rest. </p>
<p>“It’s important to finish the season well, first of all,” guard Joe Berger said. “You don’t want to back your way into the playoffs. That’s a terrible way to go into the postseason. And second, [it’s] to have that week of recovery, health-wise.” </p>
<p>Vikings players aren’t expecting Zimmer would send them home for the entire wild-card week — “No, no chance,” Rudolph said — but they aren’t necessarily looking for that, either. </p>
<p>“Honestly, I think if you want an entire week off, when we have a chance to win two games and get to the Super Bowl, why would you really be here?” Rudolph said. “I have a feeling this bye week would be different than a bye week in the middle of the year, where guys can’t wait to get away. </p>
<p>‘‘Yeah, you do have to rest your body and rest your mind. But I think there will be an eagerness and a sense of urgency like, ‘Hey, let’s get back to work. We’ve got two games, and we could be playing in a Super Bowl in our own stadium.” </p>
<p>The Vikings won their first four games after their bye week in November, and it would seem likely they’d follow a similar schedule to what they did after returning from a victory over the Browns in London, spending at least a couple days of a playoff bye week with practice sessions focused on cleaning up their own flaws, before giving players a few days off and beginning preparation for a division round opponent. </p>
<p>They also have done strong work the past two weeks against teams with nothing at stake, beating the Bengals and Packers by a combined score of 50-7. With such a big payoff available to them Sunday against the Bears, the Vikings’ focus figures to be sharp. </p>
<p>“We have a lot of competitive guys that love to play football,” wide receiver Adam Thielen said. “We have a lot of guys that don’t care what the situation is — if we’re in the playoffs, out of the playoffs. We just want to go out there and play football, and I think that shows on the field, for sure.” </p>

<p>Tucci Benucch will close its Mall of America location on Feb. 4, ending a 25-year run and bragging rights as one the mall’s original eateries, managers confirmed Wednesday. </p>
<p>Also closing will be the restaurant’s adjacent Magic Pan Crepe Stand. </p>
<p>Employees were notified about the change three weeks ago, including two servers who have been at the classic Italian Tucci restaurant since the mall’s opening day in 1992. Several others have worked at Tucci for nearly two decades. </p>
<p>“There have been a lot of tears,” said Tucci manager Erin Weeks. “Everybody loves it here.” </p>
<p>She noted that 80 affected employees from Tucci and Magic Pan Crepe will be given the chance to transfer to other local restaurants owned by Tucci’s parent firm, Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises. </p>
<p>Lettuce Entertain You also operates the Twin City Grill at MOA; three Big Bowl restaurants at the Ridgedale Center in Minnetonka, the Galleria Edina and Rosedale Center in Roseville; 14 Big Bowl Chinese Express sites inside Lunds &amp; Byerlys supermarkets; and “Tucci Italian” sites in Minnetonka and Edina, said spokeswoman Laura Nessel. </p>
<p>It is not yet known which tenant or tenants will fill the soon-to-be vacant sites that sit on the mall’s west side on the first floor. </p>
<p>“We are sad to see them go and thank all our guests who supported them throughout the years,” the Mall of America’s management said in a statement. “With change always comes opportunity and we look forward to exciting announcements for those spaces in 2018.” </p>
<p>About 40 of the more than 500 stores and restaurants at MOA opened when the mall did. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Men’s skaters take to the course for practice during the Red Bull Crashed Ice 2017: Saint Paul.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Crews in downtown St. Paul on Wednesday began constructing the Red Bull Crashed Ice course, which will host extreme ice skaters for the annual event in January. </p>
<p>Starting this year, the course will be gated for security reasons and attendees can buy premium tickets. Premium tickets cost $10 to $20, though spectators can pay up to $350 for additional perks like a heated bar and access to the starting line of the event, which runs Jan. 19 and 20. </p>
<p>“The premium ticketing option is just to offer the option for viewers to have a different viewing experience, to get different views and closer to the track,” said Alyssa Stalzer, account executive with New York-based M&amp;C Saatchi. </p>
<p>The sloping, curving course in front of the Cathedral of St. Paul runs more than 1,100 feet and takes about three weeks to build. Project manager Andrew Markey said workers on Wednesday began unloading seven trucks of scaffolding steel that arrived from Nashville. </p>
<p>“This weather is a little demotivating. But so far so good,” Markey said. </p>
<p>Workers first construct the scaffolding, then lay the plywood track, install hockey rink-style boards along the sides, assemble refrigerated matting and create the ice. </p>
<p>The course follows the same path as last year, Markey said, but has some new features like a large jump on the John Ireland Boulevard bridge over Interstate 94. </p>
<p>Markey said the frigid temperatures can slow the pace of work. </p>
<p>“The real challenge is when we start to make the ice, when we start running water and trying to keep all of our hoses from freezing,” he said. </p>
<p>He added that the site will be about evenly split between the premium and free zones, and there will be three entry gates. </p>
<p>Tickets are available at <a href="https://www.universe.com/events/red-bull-crashed-ice-2018-st-paul-tickets-saint-paul-ZM630P">tinyurl.com/crashed2018</a>. People can RSVP online for the free admission, but it is not necessary.</p>
<p>A $10 or $20 ticket on Friday or Saturday, respectively, allows viewing from the lower track. For $135 ($200 on Saturday), spectators can watch from the warmth of the Ice Club with an open bar. Three hundred dollars also buys access to the starting line and an after party at the Palace Theater. </p>
<p>“Everyone will be accommodated who wants to attend,” Stalzer said. </p>

<p>New house and apartment construction soared in December, ending a year to remember in Twin Cities residential real estate. </p>
<p>There was a 36-percent increase in single-family construction permits this month, with apartment developments experiencing a similar gain, Housing First Minnesota and the Builders Association of the Twin Cities reported Wednesday. </p>
<p>And for the full year, builders throughout the metro area pulled 6,113 permits to build 13,436 houses and rental units, the most since 2005, the trade groups said. Compared to last year, that represents a 14-percent increase in permits and a 36-percent increase in total units. </p>
<p>“Everyone was flat-out busy,” said Bob Michels, president of Housing First Minnesota and a Twin Cities builder. “It felt like the good old days.” </p>
<p>Demand for rentals has been stronger than for single-family houses for the eight years since the 2007-09 recession, but this year builders scrambled for both types of construction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Through November, there were just under 5,000 sales of newly built homes in the metro, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors (MAAR). That was up 18.5 percent from the first 11 months of 2016. Those figures don’t include new houses that were never listed through the Regional Multiple Listing Service. </p>
<p>For both apartments and houses, affordability is a growing concern as prices reached a new high in 2017. Increases are being driven by a combination of a shortage of housing and high construction costs. </p>
<p>As of November the median sale price of a new house in the Twin Cities was $329,000, or $174 per square foot, according to MAAR. That’s compared with $238,000, or $142, for an existing one. </p>
<p>“Our industry is facing a serious labor shortage along with high regulatory costs. Both will continue to constrain the homebuilding industry and have an impact on housing affordability in 2018,” said David Siegel, executive director of Housing First Minnesota. </p>
<p>Though the permit data is for the 13-county metro area, the bulk of that housing is being built in the cities and counties at the core. But there was more activity this year in outlying suburbs where land is more plentiful and less expensive. </p>
<p>In terms of total permits, Lakeville was the busiest city with 502. Plymouth was next with 380, followed by Blaine with 327. Lake Elmo issued the fourth most permits with 261. It was also the biggest gainer after issuing fewer than 30 permits in 2016. </p>
<p>“Excellent school districts are a major motivating factor for new home buyers in Lake­ville,” said Todd Stutz, president of Robert Thomas Homes, a semi-custom builder. </p>
<p>Last year, the company sold 94 homes in Lakeville’s Spirit of Brandtjen Farm, one of the most popular housing developments in the metro. Of his sales in that development, he said, house prices ranged from $400,000 to $1.1 million. Nearly 70 percent of those houses were to-be-built while about 30 percent were spec houses already in the company’s inventory. </p>

<div><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="375" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6sjfN/1/" width="100%"></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>Stutz said his current sales backlog is already about 20 percent higher than at this time a year ago. </p>
<p>“We are cautiously optimistic about the new home market in 2018 based upon positive job growth, historically low mortgage rates and consumer confidence,” Stutz said. </p>
<p>The local report mirrors a national trend. As of November, the latest data available, single-family permits reached a 10-year high, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. </p>
<p>In the coming year, the demand for single-family houses is expected to keep growing. </p>
<p>Nationwide, apartment construction is expected to show signs of easing as rising rents and vacancy rates stifle demand. That won’t be the case in the Twin Cities, where the apartment construction market is forecast to reach new highs. About 5,000 new units are expected to hit the market, up from about 3,500 this year. </p>
<p>Multifamily projects represented 57 percent of all new home construction in the metro this year. Minneapolis was the busiest for apartment construction with 1,690 total units. </p>

        <title>DA won’t file charges against officers in Kansas man’s death</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By JOHN HANNA — Associated Press</h4>
<p>TOPEKA, Kan. — The local district attorney announced Wednesday that he does not plan to file criminal charges against two Kansas police officers in the fatal shooting of a black man earlier this year, saying the man struggled with the officers and reached for a gun he had attempted to hide. </p>
<p>Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay released a seven-page legal analysis that was in line with the initial account Topeka police gave of the Sept. 28 shooting of 30-year-old Dominique White near a park. Kagay’s report described White, who had spent seven months in prison on a felony gun charge, as acting suspiciously after the officers responded to a call about shots being fired. </p>
<p>The district attorney’s analysis said police found a firearm loaded with eight rounds of ammunition on White, along with two loaded magazines and a knife. The report described White as “uncooperative and combative throughout the incident.” </p>
<p>“It was Mr. White’s actions that escalated these events,” Kagay said in his report, adding later that “no reasonable judge or jury would find the actions of either officer involved in this matter to be unlawful.” </p>
<p>The city has faced criticism over the handling of the shooting. It has not released the names of the officers involved, and police body camera footage wasn’t made public until Kagay showed it to news reporters Wednesday. </p>
<p>In the footage , which some media including The Topeka Capital-Journal posted online, the officers try to search White. He struggles briefly with the officers when one of them grabs his hands and wrists. They repeatedly urge him to stop, and he breaks away to flee from them. Moments later, multiple shots are fired at him. </p>
<p>White’s death certificate shows he died from gunshot wounds to his back. Kagay’s report confirms he was shot in the back. </p>
<p>White’s family members said in a statement that they are “incredibly disappointed” by the district attorney’s decision. </p>
<p>“My son was shot in the back while attempting to run away from officers,” White’s mother, Mary Theresa Wynne, said in the statement. “The video shows that they did not need to shoot and kill him.” </p>
<p>The family’s attorney is Gillian Cassell-Stiga of Beldock Levine &amp; Hoffman, the same law firm that represented the family of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was stopped by police on Staten Island in 2014 for selling untaxed cigarettes and died after a white officer placed him in a chokehold. While no one was prosecuted over Garner’s death, the city paid $6 million to settle a civil court lawsuit. </p>
<p>Topeka city spokeswoman Molly Hadfield said the Police Department will complete its own follow-up internal investigation before deciding whether to release the officers’ names. </p>
<p>Kagay’s report noted that the area on Topeka’s east side where White was shot has had nearly weekly reports of gunshots, 32 reported robberies and two homicides in the past five years. The report described the two officers as police veterans familiar with the area. </p>
<p>White had been out of prison less than five months. He was ordered to serve probation after pleading guilty to a burglary charge in 2015, went to prison in October 2016 after pleading no contest to illegally possessing a firearm and was not supposed to have a gun. </p>
<p>According to Kagay’s report, White tried to walk away from officers when they arrived at the scene and ignored multiple requests to stop before they caught up with him. The report said his blood later tested positive for the presence of marijuana and methamphetamine. </p>
<p>White had gloves in his possession that tested positive for gunshot residue, the report said. That and other evidence suggested White fired the shots that brought officers to the area, according to the report. </p>
<p>“There is also little doubt that Mr. White was attempting to avoid being detained or searched by the officers,” Kagay said in the report. He added that the officers remained “calm and professional.” </p>
<p>White’s stepmother, Molly White, said the situation still shouldn’t have ended with his death. </p>
<p>“Had Topeka police exercised restraint, Dominique would be alive with us today,” she said in a statement. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>NEW YORK — New York City says its jail population is below 9,000 for the first time since 1982 and is hailing the drop as a step toward closing the notorious Rikers Island jail complex. </p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio (dih BLAH’-zee-oh) said Wednesday the city is on track for a daily average jail population in December of about 8,980 people. </p>
<p>Crime has been falling for years in the nation’s largest city. Officials also reduced detention for people charged with low-level crimes and took steps to trim the numbers awaiting trial and serving sentences in jail. </p>
<p>Most inmates are at Rikers, where violence, mismanagement and corruption have come under scrutiny in recent years. </p>
<p>The Democratic mayor has said he wants to close Rikers and instead build smaller jails and expand existing ones. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Susan Shanard Burns-Stidger hated obituaries and funerals, so when she died of cancer on Dec. 10 at age 68, she had already <a href="http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/232934/?fullname=susan-shanard-burns-stidger">written her own tribute</a> — a simple, humor-filled note declaring that she had been “excused from the table.”</p>
<p>On Jan. 7 — after the holidays because she didn’t want to bother anyone — her husband, Gene Stidger, will host a happy hour at the Wayzata American Legion, in place of a funeral. </p>
<p>“That was her,” Stidger said. “She had a very smart wit about her. And a celebration of life, that’s it, was what she wanted.” </p>
<p>A Minnetonka native, Burns-Stidger grew up at the Panama Canal, where her father worked as a lawyer for Cargill. The family moved back to Minnesota when she was a teenager. Burns-Stidger graduated from Orono High School and went on to earn a four-year degree in Virginia. </p>
<p>She was an avid book lover, known for reading a book in a single day. As a young adult, she opened her own book shop. Later, she and her husband made a spare bedroom into a library, which they filled with nearly 3,000 books. </p>
<p>Stidger said they met later in life (both had been married previously) but had a passionate marriage, rarely separating and never going to bed angry. </p>
<p>About a decade ago, Burns-Stidger was nearing the end of her 43-year career working in the Hennepin County child protection services. She was looking for a golf partner to join her and another pair of friends at the Orono public course. Stidger was at the course that day and volunteered to play a round with Burns-Stidger. They hit it off and quickly started dating. And soon, they decided to adopt — a 115-pound black Labrador named Brut. </p>
<p>Six years later, they were married at the nine-hole golf course where they met. </p>
<p>When friends asked why they were getting hitched after living together for some time, Burns-Stidger would reply with a smile: “Well, we have to make the dog legitimate.” </p>
<p>Behind the quick humor, though, was a heart of gold, Stidger said. His wife — a woman who loved to drive fast, bet on horse races and grow flowers in shades of yellow, her favorite color — never had children of her own but was a mother figure in her community. </p>
<p>At the Wayzata American Legion, where she and her husband often went for happy hour to watch Wild games and visit with friends, she’d often lend money to folks who were down on their luck. </p>
<p>“She’d give people $50 or $100 to get back on their feet,” Stidger said. “Sometimes she’d pay their rent. And she never asked for it back.” </p>
<p>Both she and Stidger, 71, retired in their early 60s and spent much of their time traveling, taking their pontoon boat out on Lake Minnetonka near their Wayzata home and golfing in mediocre fashion — the ball occasionally going straight, Stidger said with a laugh. </p>
<p>“She was the best thing that ever happened to me,” he added tearfully. “She’s my angel in heaven, looking down.” </p>
<p>When Burns-Stidger got sick in August, she urged him not to tell anyone. She died quietly, at home. </p>
<p>In her obituary, she wrote: “Never lost God during my illness; wasn’t aware I’d misplaced him,” and urged people to “direct any memorials to a friend in need.” </p>
<p>Stidger hopes that friends, family and acquaintances will come for the celebration of Burns-Stidger at the Legion in an outpouring of love for the witty, giving love of his life. </p>
<p>“I’ll miss you,” she wrote to the impending crowd in her tribute. Then she added, in parentheses: “Well, most of you.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The world’s richest people grew a whopping $1 trillion richer, according to a new report from Bloomberg News. That is about four times the gains they made last year. </p>
<p>That data come courtesy of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks and ranks the world’s 500 richest people. It attributes much of the economic growth to the stock market’s record-high year. (The MSCI World and Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 indexes grew about 20 percent this year.) </p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, clocked in as the world’s richest person, gaining $34.2 billion in wealth. (Bezos owns the Washington Post.) Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates came in at No. 2. Bezos is worth about $99.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. Gates is valued at $91.3 billion. </p>
<p>China’s 1 percent did particularly well. There are 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index, and they gained a combined $177 billion this year. That 65 percent jump was the largest for any of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of China Evergrande Group, a property developer, saw his personal bank accounts swell by $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year. </p>
<p>Ma Huateng, co-founder of Tencent Holdings, a Chinese technology investment firm, saw his fortune double to $41 billion, making him the second richest person in Asia. The number of billionaires in Asia has surpassed the number in the United States for the first time, according to a recent UBS Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. </p>
<p>Russia’s 27 richest residents did well, too, adding $29 billion to grow to $275 billion, despite the international economic sanctions imposed after President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — The Latest on a rush to take advantage of a disappearing tax exemption (all times local): </p>
<p>6:30 p.m. </p>
<p>The IRS has issued guidance that could help homeowners figure out if they can save money by paying next year’s local property taxes early. </p>
<p>The federal tax overhaul signed by Republican President Donald Trump last week puts a new $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes. </p>
<p>People in some states have been lining up to pay their 2018 taxes early, hoping for one last shot at the exemption. </p>
<p>The IRS says Wednesday that some homeowners who pay real estate taxes early will be able to claim the deduction, but only if the taxes were assessed, billed and paid in 2017. </p>
<p>The IRS says people can’t guess at what next year’s assessment might be, pay that amount ahead of time and still get the deduction. </p>
<h4>___ </h4>
<p>12:48 p.m. </p>
<p>Homeowners are lining up in droves at local tax collection offices, hoping for a last chance to take a major tax deduction before it is wiped out next year. </p>
<p>In Hempstead, New York, town Tax Receiver Donald Clavin said “thousands” of people packed his office Tuesday trying to pay their 2018 property taxes a year in advance. </p>
<p>Similar scenes played out at government offices in towns and counties around the country with high local taxes. </p>
<p>The federal tax overhaul signed by President Donald Trump last week puts a new $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes. </p>
<p>People in some states are trying to delay that hike for a year by paying their 2018 taxes early. </p>
<p>The IRS hasn’t yet said how it would handle prepayments. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>I appreciate the earnest tone and the call to read great literary classics that emerge from <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-40-greatest-books-we-all-should-read/466007713/">the piece</a> written by two law professors (“The 40 greatest books we all should read,” Dec. 23). However, I am dismayed, and unfortunately not surprised to see only four female authors in a list of 39.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, “Designating a ‘canon’ of great works is a daring enterprise.” And yet, so many male literary theorists and historians over the last three centuries have enthusiastically taken on this task, relegating the masterpieces written by women authors to the dustbin or to distinctly minor positions beyond the gates of the sacrosanct literary masterpiece club. </p>
<p>As a literature professor for 46 years, I think I have a well-defined sense of what constitutes timeless, universal and truly artful writing that moves readers to reflect deeply about the human condition. Yet I think that the “unapologetic” mission of Profs. Robert Delahunty and John Radsan to “pass on the traditions” they themselves “received during [their] educations” suggests that they have unquestioningly accepted the largely patriarchal standards of what constitutes great literature. </p>
<p>I am left wondering why the following books, for example, are left out of their list of greats: Edith Wharton’s “House of Mirth,” Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse,” George Eliot’s (Mary Ann Evans’) “Middlemarch,” Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple,” Amy Tan’s “The Joy Luck Club,” Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God” and Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice.” </p>
<p>Could it be that such books were not a staple of the masculine-centered “classical” education that this article’s authors had? What makes these literary works less durable, less powerful in presenting heroic, vividly drawn characters whose lives and situations are uniquely memorable and meaningful? What makes the above works by enormously skilled women writers less “great” than those by John Updike, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and Homer? </p>
<p>What makes “A Raisin in the Sun,” Lorraine Hansberry’s magnificent play on the dynamics of family life and the fragility of human dreams in a racist society, less great than Chekhov’s play “The Cherry Orchard” or Shakespeare’s “King Lear”? </p>
<p>And lastly, what criteria are Delahunty and Radsan using when they privilege Charles Dickens’ novel, “A Tale of Two Cities” over his contemporary Elizabeth Gaskell’s novel “Mary Barton”? </p>
<p style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;"> </p>

<h4>In the annals of President Donald Trump’s odd dealings with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, give Trump credit for making a straightforward decision to defy Putin by <a href="http://www.startribune.com/us-officials-say-lethal-weapons-headed-to-ukraine/466068573/">supplying arms</a> to Ukraine.</h4>
<p>The State Department says the U.S. will provide Ukraine with “enhanced defensive capabilities” to protect itself against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. What this means, according to news reports, is that the U.S. is finally prepared to help Ukraine’s military punch back in a murky conflict cooked up by Putin. American weapons going to Ukraine will include Javelin anti-tank missiles and sniper rifles. </p>
<p>You may be surprised to learn there still is a conflict in eastern Ukraine. Indeed there is, with reports of intensified shelling in recent days, though an ostensible cease-fire has been in place for more than two years. Violence there has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 and driven 1.5 million people from their homes. </p>
<p>Putin is the scheming villain responsible for splintering Ukraine as part of his ambition to reassert Russian power. In 2014, he waltzed into Crimea (there is no better verb to describe his actions). Putin seized and annexed that vital region of Ukraine in the wake of Ukrainian political upheaval. He followed up by orchestrating the uprising in eastern Ukraine, intentionally destabilizing a country that had dreams of joining the European Union and NATO. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia but did little else after Putin took the Crimean Peninsula in what was the first big European land grab since World War II. Obama decided that providing lethal weapons to Ukraine would accomplish little but antagonize Putin. Yet refusing to arm Ukraine had the opposite effect:  It emboldened Putin. Obama’s hesitance is one reason why Russia-backed rebels control eastern Ukraine today. </p>
<p>Putin’s meddling in the affairs of other states won’t stop unless he is challenged. Trump has done that. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The recent reversal of a last-minute Obama administration move to block a mining project on the edge of northern Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is troubling but should come as a shock to no one. </p>
<p>A year ago, the state’s environmental advocates were hailing a major victory in their efforts to derail a risky new type of mining in Minnesota — copper and nickel extraction, which can discharge polluted water long after mining ends. A high-profile lobbying campaign led by Ely’s politically connected <a href="https://www.savetheboundarywaters.org/sites/default/files/public/attachments/15.fall_broadsides_beckyprofile_0.pdf">Becky Rom</a> helped convince outgoing Obama officials to reject a Chilean-owned mining company’s routine request to renew two leases on federally owned land near the BWCA.</p>
<p>But what is accomplished via political back channels can just as easily be undone, as the Star Tribune Editorial Board <a href="http://www.startribune.com/victory-for-environmentalists-and-bwca-eventually-could-backfire/407147396/">warned</a> in late 2016. The victory for environmentalists set an alarming precedent, injecting political advocacy at another point in the oversight process. That cracked open the door to not only undo the decision, but to allow interference elsewhere in what should be a consistent, data-driven review process.</p>
<p>Predictably, the U.S. Department of the Interior, now led by Republican Ryan Zinke, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/feds-ok-mining-on-edge-of-bwca/465989843/">announced</a> last Friday it has rejected the Obama’s administration’s legal basis for denying the two leases. This paves the way for federal officials to grant the leases sought by Twin Metals, which is owned by Chilean conglomerate <a href="http://www.antofagasta.co.uk/">Antofagasta</a>.</p>
<p>Some context is critical as Minnesotans weigh the developments. The decision does not greenlight mining on the leased parcels, located south of Ely and north of Babbitt. The company is still doing exploration. When it decides to go further, the project will have to go through environmental reviews and permitting, a process that has mired down PolyMet, another northern Minnesota copper mining project, for a decade. </p>
<p>The Interior decision also leaves intact an additional proposal by the outgoing Obama administration to “withdraw 235,000 acres of federal lands and minerals in northern Minnesota from future mining activity,” according to a Twin Metals statement. </p>
<p>Still, there’s reason to be alarmed about the credibility of future decisionmaking on the Twin Metals project, which unlike PolyMet is located within the BWCA watershed. The lease reversal by Obama officials, done in the last days of the administration, spotlighted the project. That put a big target on it under a new president and Republican-controlled Congress who are aggressively pursuing environmental protection rollbacks. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, legislation favorable to the mining industry has been introduced in Congress. A bill authored by U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, a Republican representing Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District, would restore Twin Metals’ leases and reopen the 235,000 acres to mining exploration. The bill <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2017/12/miner-problem-emmer-mining-bill-passes-house-who-will-take-it-senate">passed</a> the House last month but hasn’t cleared the Senate.</p>
<p>The Obama administration denial may have spurred Antofagasta to ramp up its own efforts to protect its project. Is it really mere coincidence that the head of the wealthy Luksic family, which controls Antofagasta, just happened late last year to the buy the Washington, D.C., <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanka-trumps-landlord-is-a-chilean-billionaire-suing-the-u-s-government-1489000307">home</a> that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner now rent?</p>
<p>The Editorial Board has long doubted that mining can be done safely so close to the BWCA. But it has put its faith in traditional environmental and permitting reviews that rely on data-driven analyses by state and federal agencies. The retaliatory politics now re-energizing the Twin Metals project cast serious doubt on the process for this particular project. </p>
<p>For that reason, it’s time to discuss other protective measures, such as legislation creating a permanent mining buffer zone around the BWCA. An act of Congress, rather than administrative measures, is a preferable, more transparent avenue to accomplish this. It’s a long shot but not impossible. U.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen, a Republican representing Minnesota’s Third District, <a href="https://paulsen.house.gov/press-releases/paulsen-votes-to-protect-boundary-waters/">voted</a> against Emmer’s bill. Paulsen also issued a moving <a href="">statement</a> on how the BWCA must be “preserved for future generations.”</p>
<p>Paulsen should put those words into action and lead on a buffer zone before it’s too late to protect one of America’s greatest natural treasures. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Helping someone at the scene of a recent auto accident sparked in me a resolve to publicly address health care costs and universal critical care coverage. I firmly believe Minnesotans want their elected leaders to stop drawing lines in the sand, stop the partisan quibbling, redouble their efforts to get something done with the health care crisis and do it in the coming 2018 session. </p>
<p>I have been asked if I would support a discussion regarding a state-based mandate for health care (“After lost mandate, what’s next for care?” <a href="http://www.startribune.com/congressional-aca-mandate-repeal-could-roll-back-health-coverage-gains/466008013/">editorial</a>, Dec. 24). Yes, I would engage such a conversation — why wouldn’t I? Health care is infected with big problems, and easy solutions are not looming on the horizon. Legislators are in no position to close their minds to an idea that has received support from both sides of the aisle over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>In 1989, an individual mandate to purchase health care insurance was championed by the politically conservative Heritage Foundation when Stuart Butler wrote: “If a young man wrecks his Porsche and has not had the foresight to obtain insurance, we may commiserate, but society feels no obligation to repair his car. But health care is different. If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance.” </p>
<p>An individual mandate resonates with conservative principles of personal responsibility, and comparisons are often made to similar requirements for auto insurance. But it is crucial to realize that an individual mandate requiring insurance companies to include too many “essential” benefits will likely sabotage the affordability and sustainability of such a mandate. Patients are capable of championing their own health care, and they should be allowed to choose what they want to buy. Teetotalers should not be forced to buy inpatient chemical dependency coverage, and seniors may want to invest their dollars on maladies of aging rather than prenatal care. Choice matters! </p>
<p>Public and private entities have both indicated strong support for a health care insurance mandate. Brainstorming and discussion may help create a blueprint for catastrophic coverage for such essentials as hospitalization, access to generic and select trade name medications, emergency room visits for true emergencies and mental health problems. (Please trust my 30 years in the trenches on at least this one point — no one knows when a mental health crisis might occur, so coverage of some sort is indeed essential.) </p>
<p>Let’s not forget that Medicare started in 1965 as a limited part A hospital-only plan and it grew thereafter. We can take a lesson from this initiative. Just because we can’t do everything doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do something. Indeed, we should do it now. </p>
<p>As a starting point, maybe everyone can agree that people should not die on the streets from heart attacks — but also that not every wart, runny nose or incidental hernia needs to be paid for by a third party. </p>
<p>But a mandate for health insurance is just one idea needing to be explored in the coming months, and individual coverage is not the only sector of the insurance marketplace clamoring for attention. Employer-based insurance is experiencing its own escalating affordability crisis. Some earnest soul-searching needs to happen at the Capitol — soon! </p>
<p>The Senate Select Committee on Health Care Consumer Access and Affordability has deliberated on numerous cost-reduction issues, including pharmaceutical prices, narrow networks, transparency of fees, low-value services, end-of-life decisions and protecting patient-doctor relationships. </p>
<p>As elected leaders, we need to roll up our sleeves and get the job done. If we don’t, we will have failed our constituents. </p>
<p>Hospitals all over the state are in trouble financially because too many bills go unpaid and charity care is crippling their ability to respond to community needs. </p>
<p>Parents and patients are being forced to make impossible choices as to whether critical medical care for their children or themselves should be subordinated to paying bills or house payments — a health crisis should not invoke fear of bankruptcy or a second mortgage. </p>
<p>Home health aides work for $12 per hour with no benefits, and the shortage of these compassionate servants intensifies while the sick and infirm pray for help and a bath. </p>
<p>The time has come for statesmanship — and this will require attention to patient choice, unintended consequences, sustainability, representation from both parties, civil tongues, and a passion for what best serves our state, our nation and the common good. </p>
<p>(Maybe now is the time for Gov. Mark Dayton to take the lead and host a breakfast with Senate and House leaders from both sides of the aisle to determine the level of resolve for addressing our health care crises in 2018. I suspect such a meeting would be more fruitful if cellphones, egos and sound bites are checked at the door.) </p>

                                    </div>
<p>On Dec. 13, the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee passed the mountain bikes in wilderness bill (HR 1349), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. This bill weakens the 1964 Wilderness Act to allow mountain bikes and other wheeled contraptions into every wilderness in the nation (“A matter of wheels in the wilderness,” <a href="http://www.startribune.com/wheels-in-the-wilderness-bill-to-allow-bikes-divides-outdoor-lovers/464650143/">Dec. 17</a>).</p>
<p>The bill passed 22-18, after initially failing 15-19. U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, the committee chairman, brought the bill back up again after more Republicans had arrived at the committee markup session. All Democratic members of the committee opposed the bill, and one Republican (U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.) also voted against it. The bill will now go to the House floor for a vote. </p>
<p>A mountain biking splinter group, the Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), has joined forces with the worst anti-wilderness Republicans to promote this attack on wilderness. And sadly, both the STC and the Republican promoters in Congress rely on a number of outright falsehoods and deliberate distortions to advance the bill. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Republican committee leadership corrupted the hearing process and refused to allow any testimony on the bill, but for the STC. Not one of the 133 conservation organizations that co-signed a letter of opposition to the bill, no wilderness experts from academia or the legal profession, and no wilderness specialists from any of the four federal land management agencies that administer wilderness were allowed to testify or correct the falsehoods. </p>
<p>Here are some of their most common misrepresentations and outright lies: </p>
<p>• That the 1964 Wilderness Act doesn’t ban bikes in wilderness. Not true. The Wilderness Act specifically prohibits “mechanical transport” in wilderness, and the law also mentions the threat of “growing mechanization.” Bikes are mechanical machines. A recent Los Angeles Times article quoted Ed Zahniser, a retired National Park Service official whose father (Howard) wrote the Wilderness Act: “The act clearly says no mechanized uses. How could they possibly say the original act allows this? They are just making it up.” </p>
<p>• That the U.S. Forest Service unilaterally banned bikes in 1984. Not true. It was the Wilderness Act that banned bikes, not the Forest Service. And none of the other three federal agencies that oversee wilderness has ever interpreted the Wilderness Act as allowing bicycles. Though the initial Forest Service regulations were confusing, the agency’s regulations were made more explicit in 1977 to specifically mention bikes. Biking bill proponents claim that because the agency’s original regulations mentioned “mechanical transport” but didn’t explicitly name bikes, it means bikes were allowed. By that measure, snowmobiles, ATVs, and helicopters should also have been allowed because the regulations mentioned only “motor vehicles.” </p>
<p>• That mechanical transport in the Wilderness Act only means motorized vehicles. Not true. The Wilderness Act specifically bans both “mechanical transport” and “motor vehicles.” </p>
<p>• That wheelchairs are prohibited in wilderness. Not true. The 1990 amendments to the Americans with Disabilities Act allow both motorized and nonmotorized wheelchairs in wilderness with reasonable safeguards to avoid abuse of the exception. And many people with disabilities want to and do enjoy nonmechanized and nonmotorized experiences in wilderness. </p>
<p>• That mountain bikers are prohibited from visiting wilderness. Not true. Only the machines that mountain bikers ride are prohibited in wilderness; mountain bikers are free to hike, paddle or horseback ride like other wilderness visitors. </p>
<p>• That mountain bikes don’t do as much trail damage as horses in wilderness. Horses certainly create impacts, as do hikers, but the test of whether something is appropriate in wilderness goes beyond physical impacts. Mountain bikes destroy wilderness character by the mere presence of these modern machines, by their speed, by their penetration of remote areas, by their destruction of solitude, by their disruption of wildlife and much more. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, HR 1349 is a dangerous attempt to weaken the Wilderness Act and crack open the National Wilderness Preservation System to bikes and other machines, and who knows what else afterward. It would be extraordinarily sad if this bill becomes law, but it would be even worse because it is based on falsehoods and deliberate distortions. </p>

Johnson, who was defeated for re-election in November, introduced a resolution at the Dec. 15 council meeting to raise the salaries of council members and the mayor. The resolution did not go through committees and was approved without discussion.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Retiring Minneapolis City Council President Barbara Johnson deserves commendation for her long service as a leader and an apology from the Star Tribune for the Dec. 27 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-s-pay-hike-needlessly-sneaky/466668853/">editorial</a> “Council pay hike needlessly sneaky.” Johnson and the other council members were simply being practical. Anyone who reads this otherwise good newspaper knows that pay for public officials is a contentious subject. Somehow, proud Minnesotans don’t think elected officials should be paid anywhere near what the private sector pays for CEOs and boards of directors running a company with a $1.5 billion annual budget. And somehow, when we extol our virtues as a city compared with Portland and Seattle, we don’t mention that they pay their council members $20,000 a year more than we do.</p>
<p>We have been lucky so far because we have a tradition of getting generally competent and honest public officials on the cheap. But as readers of this newspaper may also have noticed recently, we are neglecting civics education in our public schools. This means we are raising a generation of children who know little about government and how it works. Respect for government and what it does is declining. And with the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission we are seeing massive amounts of money being poured into campaigns, now including local campaigns. Special interest groups with a narrow agenda and money-raising ability can select, train and finance candidates who will fight for their agenda. </p>
<p>Any new mayor and council members who made raising their salaries an early priority would know it would be political suicide, as well as time-consuming. Those on the current council were political realists, exercising leadership, which is what we taxpayers who believe government is necessary pay them to do. Transparency may be an ideal, but it is not always fair or practical. The council broke no laws or rules. It simply exercised leadership for the good of the city. </p>

<h4>GUNS </h4>
<h4>Base concealed-carry reciprocity on data (which looks favorable) </h4>
<p>The Dec. 26 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/push-for-gun-permits-across-state-lines-concerns-minnesota-law-enforcement/465038423/">article</a> “Permit push for guns is divisive” says that “law enforcement leaders” are concerned that a proposal to make any state’s permits for carrying concealed guns applicable in all other states “could harm public safety.” But later the article says that 24 state attorneys general wrote to Congress supporting the bill while only 17 wrote against the bill. It sounds to me like at least some law enforcement leaders support the bill.</p>
<p>The article didn’t provide data as to whether concealed-carry permit holders commit crimes at a higher rate than other citizens. According to a report by John R. Lott Jr. of the Crime Prevention Research Center, permit holders not only commit fewer crimes than the general population but also commit fewer crimes than police officers. The general population commits 3,813 crimes per 100,000 people per year. Policemen committed 103 crimes per 100,000 officers per year. Permit holders in Texas and Florida committed crimes at one-sixth the rate of policemen. Of course, the crime rates of permit holders vary from state to state. There may be some states where permit holders commit crimes at a higher rate than in Texas and Florida. But even if they commit crimes at seven times the rate of Texas and Florida, the rate would be comparable to that of policemen and much lower than that of the general population. </p>
<p>The decision about whether to allow concealed-carry permits to apply in all states should be made based on data. And it is the responsibility of the Star Tribune and other newspapers to supply that data. The article didn’t provide the necessary data to make the decision and instead relied mostly on quotes from opponents of the bill. </p>

<h4>GREAT BOOKS </h4>
<h4>Don’t limit yourself to classics </h4>
<p>Reading the Dec. 23 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-40-greatest-books-we-all-should-read/466007713/">commentary</a> “The 40 greatest books we all should read,” I recalled being at a local bookstore doing a signing for a book I had written. A man approached, and we had a brief exchange. Then he put a self-satisfied smile on his face and said he only reads the classics and promptly walked away. I didn’t say anything, but thought to myself that he must let other people decide what he will read.</p>
<p>Making a list of the greatest books, and teaching only those books, indicates the attitude that anything worth reading has already been written and we shouldn’t bother with whatever is being written today or will be in the future. In reality, those books did not start out as influential classics. They became that way because authors were willing to write new works and, when they first came out, readers were willing to pay attention to books that did not have any durability or influence. </p>
<p>While attention should be given to the classics, people should also be taught to look to contemporary and little-known writing and decide for themselves what to read. </p>
<p>Bill Cutler, Oak Park Heights </p>
<h4>THE CULTURE </h4>
<h4>Fellowship without judgment — that’s the spirit we need </h4>
<p>Driving down to the Mankato area the day after Christmas, I passed a little apple orchard painted neon yellow. A sign at the orchard said “Merry Christmas” on one side and “Season’s Greetings” on the other — subtly skewering a political divide small businesses must straddle not just at this time of year but all year long these days. </p>
<p>I reflected on the sign as I continued on my way to New Creation Church, a large, evangelical congregation that for the last two years has opened its doors to about 400 people in the Native American and European-American communities who come together to heal the old self-inflicted wounds created when racial hatred, fear and the breakdown of the U.S. government during the Civil War led to starvation, massacre and finally the largest mass hanging in our nation’s history. </p>
<p>Members of New Creation welcomed me and my humanist/agnostic/atheist companions into their kitchen and spiritual home without judgment and stood beside us in common cause and purpose as we fed the 400 folks bent on sharing bread and fellowship. Here’s hoping that love can overcome hate, that kindness can heal and that even highway signs can eventually make peace with themselves. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By JENNIFER PELTZ — Associated Press</h4>
<p>NEW YORK — A ferry carrying more than two dozen people hit a sandbar and got stuck for hours Wednesday, spurring an evacuation on a frigid night in the waters off New York City. </p>
<p>No injuries were reported in the second stranding in a month for the city’s newly-expanded ferry service. </p>
<p>The city-sponsored, privately run ferry left the Rockaway peninsula in Queens with 27 people aboard at 5:15 p.m., bound for lower Manhattan on a 20-degree evening. About 10 minutes into the trip, “we just came to a screeching halt,” passenger Jake Nicholson said. </p>
<p>“Everyone pretty much went flying,” he later told The Associated Press by phone from the boat, stuck in the waters between Rockaway and Brooklyn. He said he was nearly tossed over the row of seats in front of him, and his phone ended up a few rows away. </p>
<p>Nicholson, a 21-year-old senior at Loyola University Maryland, said passengers initially were told that there was a mechanical error, then that the boat had hit a sandbar and that the captain tried to back the boat off it. </p>
<p>Four hours later, he, his brother and a friend were waiting their turn to get off the chilly ferry in the small, inflatable boats rescuers were using because of the shallow water. By then, passengers were “just sitting down, trying to stay warm,” said Nicholson, who’d missed the Washington Capitals-New York Rangers game that was the reason for his ferry trip. </p>
<p>“It was difficult because they had to climb down a ladder, a 12-foot straight ladder, down the back of the ferry onto our boat and then transferred onto several different boats — so a very slow, tedious, time-consuming operation,” said fire department Chief John Esposito. </p>
<p>The evacuation got underway around 7:30 p.m. Officials said 23 passengers and one crewmember were safely removed sometime before 11 p.m. The disabled boat was expected to be towed off the sandbar overnight. </p>
<p>Phone and email messages to the ferry company, Hornblower Inc., weren’t immediately returned. </p>
<p>The ferry to and from Rockaway is part of a $335 million effort , launched this summer, to use the waterways to ease strains on New York’s public transportation system. The $2.75-a-ride service is separate from the famous free ferry that has long traveled between Manhattan and Staten Island. </p>
<p>Last month, more than 100 passengers were rescued from a Rockaway-bound ferry that ran aground off lower Manhattan. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Guilt can be a complicated element in the parent-child equation; we feel guilty, they feel guilty, we may make them feel guilty and then feel guilty about that. But certain kinds of guilt are a healthy part of child development. </p>
<p>Tina Malti, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto who has studied the development of guilt in children, considers guilt an emotion similar to empathy. </p>
<p>“Moral guilt is healthy, good to develop,” she said. “It helps the child refrain from aggression, anti-social behavior.” </p>
<p>A child who has made another child cry might have an empathic reaction, she said, and feel bad because the other child is sad. Or he might feel guilty because whatever he did to the other child violated his own standards of right and wrong. “Those two reactions can be entirely independent, or can go together.” </p>
<p>There is a developmental pathway for guilt, Malti said; very young children may cry if they break a toy, but children do not have enough understanding of other people’s perspective to experience the more complex emotion of guilt until around age 6. By then, she said, most children report guilt in response to transgressions, and that can help them treat other people kindly. “There’s lots of evidence that healthy guilt promotes children’s pro-social behavior,” she said. </p>
<p>Count this as another area where our parents and grandparents probably had it easier than parents do today — they probably didn’t worry too much about making their children feel guilty. They might even have invoked the S-word — shame — as in, “You should be ashamed of yourself.” </p>
<p>The usual distinction is that guilt is the internal emotion, what you feel inside when you know you’ve done wrong or caused harm. Shame is external; it’s what you feel before the judgment of other members of your family or your society who know of your transgression. But that distinction is a little simplistic, said Roy Richard Grinker, a professor of anthropology at George Washington University, because “in the absence of an audience, we can feel shame just imagining it.” Part of growing up in your culture is “a kind of internalization of the values that a society holds,” he said. </p>
<p>For Colin Leach, a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut, both guilt and shame are loaded terms. “What really matters is the way adults and also kids think about missteps or mishaps,” he said, “how much they believe they themselves or their relationships can be improved with effort.” </p>
<p>Dr. Helen Egger, chairwoman of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health, said that guilt reflects what is called “theory of mind,” that is, a child’s developing understanding that other people have feelings and a point of view; “children have to have developed a theory of mind, self and others, to be able to feel guilt.” And rarely, if a child doesn’t develop the capacity to feel guilt, she said, “when you have lying or lack of guilt, the child seems to have a reduced capacity for empathy.” </p>
<p>For example, she said, you might worry about a child who shows a pattern of more deliberate aggression, hitting another child in order to get something, rather than out of anger, then not responding to the other child’s distress. </p>
<p>Guilt is part of children’s normal development, and we don’t actually want to see children grow up without it, but we also worry that they may judge themselves too harshly, or feel responsible for things that are well beyond their powers. </p>
<p>With younger children, Egger said, guilt can get mixed up with magical thinking and a sense of their own omnipotence, as when they feel responsible for a sibling’s illness or disability. And as children grow, that kind of worrying can be linked to anxiety disorders, she said. </p>
<p>So how can parents nurture the development of conscience and moral feelings, but avoid weighing children down with dark feelings of doom? Guilt when it’s constructive should give a child an appropriate sense of power and agency, a realistic determination to do things differently. Focus on specific actions, and not on the child’s character; the message is not that there is something wrong with the child, but that the child chose to do something wrong, with certain results. </p>
<p>Malti talked about guilt “induction,” in which parents explain the consequences of actions very clearly: “Your sibling is crying, and this is because you have damaged his toy.” As a clinician, she said, she has worked with children who showed a lack of guilt, and induction can be very helpful. On the other hand, she has also worked with children weighed down with dysfunctional guilt, in which they feel responsible for the sufferings of other people well outside their control. </p>
<p>“If parents are fighting,” Malti said, “it’s important to say how this is not related to the child’s behavior.” Otherwise the child may continue to worry, and “this can lead to a more existential type of anxiety or depression.” </p>
<p>Children have to be able to look at their behavior and their relationships, to understand what is actually their responsibility. “They have to have an accurate gauge,” Leach said. “Feeling a little bad about it can motivate us, but retrospectively ruminating about where we’ve fallen short or being paralyzed by that tends not to be productive and tends to be really psychologically painful and harmful.” </p>
<p>And some children, just like some adults, he said, are more inclined to negative thinking and to blame themselves: Parents and teachers should think about how they respond to mistakes, because the language adults use can either interrupt or reinforce the child’s negative way of thinking. Avoid “language that sends kids the message that something’s wrong with <span>you</span>, as opposed to giving kids concrete strategies for being better going forward.”</p>

                                    </div>
<p><span>WASHINGTON </span>– The Trump administration is setting the stage to unveil tough new trade penalties against China early next year, moving closer to an oft-promised crackdown that some U.S. business executives fear will ignite a costly battle.</p>
<p>Corporate officials and analysts closely tracking trade policy said that President Donald Trump is expected to take concrete actions on disputes involving China within weeks. </p>
<p>Trump is due by the end of January to render his first decision in response to petitions from U.S. companies seeking tariffs or import quotas on Chinese solar panels and washing machines manufactured in China and its neighbors. </p>
<p>U.S. trade officials in both cases have determined that domestic manufacturers have been injured by surging imports and have recommended that he erect new trade barriers. </p>
<p>China is Minnesota’s biggest export market outside North America, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development. Companies in the state sold $615 million of goods to customers in China during the third quarter, including $173 million worth of machinery and $167 million worth of medical equipment. </p>
<p>Trump could also order new limits on Chinese investment in the U.S. or raise tariffs unilaterally — a likely violation of U.S. commitments to the World Trade Organization — pending the outcome of a broader investigation into Beijing’s alleged failure to protect foreign companies’ intellectual property rights, analysts say. </p>
<p>White House action is also due on a Commerce Department probe triggered by worries about the national security impact of rising imports of Chinese steel and aluminum. </p>
<p>“Their intent is to bring shock and awe,” said Scott Kennedy, an expert on Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They’re not kidding around.” </p>
<p>On Dec. 6, Robert Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, had a contentious discussion of administration trade policy with members of the US-China Business Council’s board of directors, which includes chief executives of companies such as Chubb Insurance and General Motors, said three executives familiar with the session. </p>
<p>During the closed-door briefing for chief executives with business in China, Lighthizer said that U.S. complaints about Chinese trade practices could not be resolved simply by additional talks with Beijing, and he appeared indifferent to concerns that the administration’s hard line risked rupturing a $600 billion annual trade relationship. </p>
<p>A Lighthizer spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment. The business group also declined to comment. </p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how extensive the administration actions will be. Trump’s repeated campaign vows to retaliate against China for policies that he says contributed to the loss of millions of U.S. jobs have yet to translate into concrete action. During a visit to Beijing last month, the president blamed his White House predecessors rather than Chinese President Xi Jinping for the yawning bilateral trade deficit. </p>
<p>That gap has only grown since Trump became president, despite his “America First” rhetoric. Through the first 10 months of this year, the U.S. incurred a $309 billion trade deficit with China, up from $289 billion during the same period one year earlier. </p>
<p>“So far, it’s been the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy turned on its head: Speak loudly and carry a small stick,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonprofit established by the United Steelworkers union and major steelmakers. </p>
<p>Still, in recent weeks, there have been mounting signs of the president’s intention to act. In a new national security strategy, Trump earlier this month described China as a strategic competitor and said that when it comes to trade, the U.S. “will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating or economic aggression.” </p>
<p>The White House document was issued less than a month after the United States formally told the WTO that China did not qualify as a “market economy” under the trade body’s rules. </p>
<p>In a dispute with the European Union, China insists that it was promised the designation by now under the terms of its 2001 membership in the WTO. The European Union and the United States insist that the Chinese state’s role in the economy remains too large to justify granting China market economy treatment. As a nonmarket economy, China is subject to higher anti-dumping duties under U.S. trade law, making the issue more than a matter of bragging rights. </p>
<p>The president also previewed the tougher line in a speech last month in Danang, Vietnam, saying that the U.S. now expects its trade “partners will faithfully follow the rules just like we do.” </p>
<p>U.S. officials say that China has not lived up to the bargain struck when it joined the WTO. Market liberalization has slowed or reversed, especially since Xi became Communist Party general secretary in 2012. State-owned enterprises get preferential financing and permit approvals and are formidable competitors for multinational corporations. </p>
<p>Total financial flows into the U.S. from China topped $46 billion last year, almost 10 times the figure from 2011. </p>
<p>U.S. business leaders anticipate a difficult 2018. “Our sense,” said Jeremie Waterman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “is that everything is on the table.” </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">A 37-year-old is charged with first-degree burglary while committing assault.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Libor Jany</h4>
<p>When a young girl got home from school one day last week, she was startled by the sight of a stranger running through her Minneapolis living room, screaming, authorities said. </p>
<p>The suspect, Richard Lee Smith, 37, allegedly punched the girl, whose age was not disclosed but who is a juvenile, and then choked her with both hands during the Dec. 22 incident, according to a criminal complaint filed in Hennepin County District Court. She managed to fight him off and break free, before running outside for help, the complaint said. </p>
<p>Police arrived at the 2500 block of Grand Avenue S. to find the front door locked but went inside after getting a key from the victim’s mother, and found Smith hiding in one of the bedrooms. Investigators say the clothes match those worn by a suspect in a restaurant robbery the previous night. A pile of items he intended to steal was found nearby, police said, and a car previously reported stolen was parked outside. </p>
<p>When police found her, the victim had red marks around her neck, the complaint said. In addition, she had bruises and swelling on her forehead and a black eye with broken blood vessels. </p>
<p>Smith, who was charged with first-degree burglary while committing assault, remains jailed in lieu of $150,000 bail. His preliminary court date was set for Thursday. </p>

Greenway officially announced his retirement from the NFL.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Former Vikings linebacker <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Chad Greenway </strong>has stayed close to the NFL and the Vikings by teaming up with the Super Bowl Host Committee to help lead volunteer efforts in the Twin Cities for Super Bowl LII in February. But when Greenway was asked if he missed the game itself, he didn’t hesitate to say no.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been too tough, to be honest with you,” he said. “As my career was winding down, I kind of knew that I wanted to be done playing. This first year out has actually been pretty enjoyable. I have had a lot of fun. It has been fun to watch the guys win and play so well, but I haven’t missed it.” </p>
<p>Greenway was with the Vikings for 11 seasons (but only played 10, after missing his rookie season in 2006 because of a torn ACL) and finished fourth in franchise history with 1,334 tackles. And while he said he loved playing football, one of the big reasons he was fine with walking away from the game was because he still had his health. </p>
<p>“The biggest thing is I have four kids, and I’m married and have a wife. So it’s one of those things where I’m more concerned with my health and my longevity at this point,” Greenway said. “It didn’t factor into me wanting to be done, I just knew I didn’t want to play anymore. It was a situation where I knew I was ready to move on, and I haven’t looked back since it happened.” </p>
<p>So in his first year away from the game, Greenway has focused on his charitable work and his volunteer work for Super Bowl LII. </p>
<p>“I do a lot of speaking events but as far as foundation events, we have most of them coming up in the spring,” he said about his <a href="https://www.chadgreenway.org/">Lead the Way Foundation</a>. “We’re pretty quiet right now but the foundation has been growing. Even this year in retirement it has been a great season, probably our best year as a foundation, actually. It has been good.”</p>
<p>And when it comes to Super Bowl LII, Greenway said the volunteer committee received 30,000 applicants. They narrowed that down to 10,000 volunteers who will greet people at the airport, direct them around the city and otherwise help out-of-town visitors. </p>
<h3><strong>Linebacking corps</strong></h3>
<p>Greenway was asked about the Vikings linebackers this season. </p>
<h4>“ <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Ben Gedeon </strong>is playing the position I played last year and he has played solid, steady football,” Greenway said. “He has been a really good player and a great special teams guy. And of course <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Eric</strong> [<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kendricks</strong>] and <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Anthony </strong>[<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Barr</strong>] have been playing lights out.</h4>
<p>“Those guys, as they came in, you could tell they had a lot of talent. As I got older in my career, you could feel those guys and their presence was going to be good. They are good players. Now that is sort of their defense, as backers, that’s kind of why they are playing so well because those guys are the core of it. They are in the middle of the [defense] and playing well.” </p>
<p>Greenway said the Vikings defense, ranked first in the NFL in total defense (280.9 yards allowed per game), is better than last season and might be the best they’ve had in some time. </p>
<p>“The numbers tell me that yes they are, absolutely,” he said. “The numbers tell me that, [from] the pass rush on the back end to the way we’re covering the middle of the field, the number two rush defense in the league (87.1 yards allowed per game, just behind the Eagles’ 75.9). We’re way better on third downs, so yeah, this is the best defense we have had here in a long time.” </p>
<p>Greenway said he watches games a bit differently these days. </p>
<p>“I look to see if the baby needs something or if the kids need something,” he said. “When I watch the game, I just try to enjoy them. I don’t try to watch too much of the ins and outs of it, just try to enjoy it as a fan.” </p>
<p>The Vikings already have their most victories since 2009, when they eventually lost 31-28 to the Saints in the NFC Championship Game. If they finish 13-3 by beating the Bears at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, they will have their best record since 1998, when they went 15-1. </p>
<p>“The NFL is a wins-and-losses sort of business, so any time you are winning, it’s so much fun to be a part of that and be around that,” Greenway said. “You can just tell the guys are having fun here, very businesslike, but they’re having fun. </p>
<p>“For me, 2009 with the NFC title game was the best run that I went on. Only playoff game I won was that year. Other than that, any time you made the playoffs it was a fun situation, but we didn’t have a lot of success there, unfortunately.” </p>
<p>Greenway said he keeps in contact with a lot of friends on the team and sees them regularly. He was asked if he had any thoughts, as someone closely tied to Super Bowl LII, about what it would mean for the Vikings to play in the game here. </p>
<p>“To have a home game for the Super Bowl would be pretty amazing,” he said. “With the way they’re playing, I think they’re very capable.” </p>
<h3><strong>Robison’s decision</strong></h3>
<p>After Greenway’s retirement, <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Brian Robison </strong>became the longest-tenured Vikings player, in his 11th season with the franchise.</p>
<p>From 2011 to 2016, Robison was one of the better defensive linemen in the NFL, recording 44½ of his 59 career sacks, with a career high of nine in 2013. </p>
<p>But this season his playing time has been more limited, playing 55.9 percent of the Vikings’ defensive snaps, which ranks 12th on the team. Still, Robison has been effective when he is on the field, recording three sacks and 18 tackles. </p>
<p>Earlier this season, he was asked if it bothers him to play less than in previous years. </p>
<p>“I’m not worried about that. I’m worried about winning ballgames,” he said. “It’s not about me. It’s about our team and winning ballgames and trying to be where we want to be at the end of the year, chasing our ultimate goal.” </p>
<p>He added that when it comes to the defensive line, the most important thing this season has been their combined play. </p>
<p>“It’s about all four of us working together. It’s not about individuals,” he said. “This is about the Minnesota Vikings. It’s not about <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Danielle </strong>[<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Hunter</strong>], it’s not about Brian Robison, it’s not about <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tom Johnson</strong>, it’s not about <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Everson Griffen</strong>, it’s about the Minnesota Vikings defense working together and being on the same page.”</p>
<p>Robison, 34, is earning a $3.9 million base salary this season and is on the books for 2018 at $3.2 million. </p>
<p>The Vikings could surely still use Robison’s veteran presence in the locker room and on the field next season. When asked if he has any plans to retire, he said that for now it’s not on his mind. </p>
<p>“I don’t know. I take it one day at a time,” he said. “I’m not thinking about the future. I’ll worry about that in the offseason and see how my body feels and just take it day by day. We’ll see where it goes.” </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">The Vikings signed long snapper Jeff Overbaugh after holding tryouts Tuesday. The San Diego State product, who was named the best specialist at the 2016 Senior Bowl, was with the Rams in training camp last year. He spent time with the Bears and Broncos this year.</div>
                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p>Jeff Overbaugh was one of two long snappers invited to the Senior Bowl in January 2016. He had handled those duties impeccably at San Diego State after arriving there from Service High School in Anchorage, Alaska. </p>
<p>The Senior Bowl workouts get wall-to-wall coverage with NFL.com and the NFL Network. Nuggets are passed along on all players, including the information that Overbaugh camped out among Kodiak bears during his adventurous youth in Alaska. </p>
<p>The Kodiaks were mentioned to Overbaugh during an interview in a small anteroom at Winter Park on Wednesday. He smiled and said: “Yeah, I think there was a little mix-up between me and my guy [Lance] Zierlein on that one. I never did go camping at the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.” </p>
<p>Zierlein is a draft analyst, talk radio host and NFL.com contributor, and apparently it was his information on Overbaugh and sleeping with the Kodiaks that keeps getting repeated when the job-seeking long snapper gets a media mention. </p>
<p>No camping out when surrounded by large bears, then? </p>
<p>“Not Kodiaks,’’ Overbaugh said. “We did camp out at Katmai National Park. There are quite a few grizzlies around there.” </p>
<p>Kodiaks. Grizzlies. I’d say Zierlein was close enough. </p>
<p>Overbaugh was with his girlfriend, Emily Carper, at her parents’ home near San Diego when he received a Christmas call to head for the Twin Cities. The Vikings wanted him at Winter Park for a tryout to replace injured Kevin McDermott as Sunday’s long snapper vs. the Bears. </p>
<p>The Vikings went with Overbaugh ahead of veteran Justin Drescher for what seems to be a one-game assignment. McDermott is expected back when the playoffs start for the Vikings, presumably on the weekend of Jan. 13-14. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure how many tryouts this year — three teams before the season started, then nine or 10 one-day tryouts during the season,’’ Overbaugh said. “I’m not looking back at those. I’m just preparing for this Sunday against the Bears.” </p>
<p>Overbaugh spent the morning at U.S. Bank Stadium working with kicker Kai Forbath and punter Ryan Quigley. He was impressed with the Vikings’ $1.15 billion palace, while also not a stranger to large domes. </p>
<p>The Dome in Anchorage was the locale where Overbaugh spent many hours working on ball-snapping skills, with his father Bill serving as holder or punter. </p>
<p>“Jeff’s goal was to play Division I football,” Bill Overbaugh said. “When he was a sophomore, Ray Guy’s group came through here with a camp for punters, kickers and long snappers. </p>
<p>“He was introduced to techniques to develop the quick-twitch muscles needed by a long snapper. He wasn’t big enough to be a lineman; he’s about 6-1 and 240 now. He saw long snapping as his way into college football.’’ </p>
<p>Overbaugh would go through the drills, and then snap the football to his father, in workouts in that large dome lasting two or three hours. He also went to offseason camps and wound up with a scholarship to be the long snapper at San Diego State. </p>
<p>“It’s a different world for long snappers,’’ Mike Morris said. “When I got into it, we were pretty much self-taught. I tried to do what I saw as a kid watching Bobby Bell with Kansas City and Mick [Tingelhoff] with the Vikings. Red Silvera and Rex McClanahan were a couple of old college coaches who showed me a few things.” </p>
<p>Morris played 13 NFL seasons and was the Vikings’ snapper for every game from 1991 to 1999. Early on, you were expected to back up at a line position; now, long snapper is a stand-alone position. </p>
<p>“You have to be perfect, too,’’ Morris said. “Coaches aren’t going to miss a Super Bowl because they had a bad snap. There are guys like this kid [Overbaugh], working on it full-time, waiting for an opening, trying to show they can throw a strike every time.” </p>
<p>Morris and Overbaugh have this in common: Morris never had a bad snap that directly cost his NFL team points, and Overbaugh was a perfect 510-for-510 on snaps at San Diego State. </p>
<p>He had a chance to snap for punts in a couple of exhibition games with the Bears. On Sunday, he will be snapping in a true NFL game for the first time. </p>
<p>Bill and Julia Overbaugh, and older son Willie, are flying in from Anchorage on Friday to be there. Willie is back home in Alaska, enjoying those grand spaces, as his brother works on throwing fastball strikes to holders and punters. </p>
<p>“Those boys grew up as quite the outdoorsmen,’’ Bill said. “They were up for anything. They went on a kayaking trip through the Grand Canyon, at ages 12 and 11.” </p>
<p>Sounds like a good way to get started on those quick-twitch muscles. </p>

<p>Thousands of Super Bowl visitors are about to experience a downtown Minneapolis rite of passage: getting lost in the skyways. </p>
<p>But planners for the big event have strategies to get perplexed partiers to their destinations, including an army of volunteer guides and a specially designed phone navigation app. </p>
<p>“You kind of know that look,” Steve Cramer said with a laugh, referring to the puzzled expressions on the faces of skyway newbies as they try to plot a route. “It’s an intricate system, not always intuitive. And for folks not from the community, it’s all brand-new.” </p>
<p>It’s Cramer’s job to make things easier. He co-leads an arm of the Super Bowl Host Committee charged with “wayfinding,” a fancy word for helping people get from Point A to Point B with a minimum of fuss and confusion. </p>
<p>It’s not a slam-dunk. Even longtime skyway users sometimes find themselves adrift. </p>
<p>“I still get lost!” said Arianna Gomes, a downtown Minneapolis worker for three years. “But I love them. They keep you warm.” </p>

<p>Larry Chevalier, a commercial real estate broker, said his visiting business clients are always impressed by the skyways. </p>
<p>“We’re unique,” he said. “People coming from other cities will be blown away.” </p>
<p>That’s the feeling Cramer hopes Super Bowl visitors will take away. In his day job as president and CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council, Cramer has a lot of experience with the skyways and people’s reactions to them. Downtown Minneapolis has nearly 9 miles of the elevated walkways, making it “as far as we know, the largest connected system anywhere,” he said. </p>
<p>But the focus of Super Bowl planners is on a few core routes linking Target Center on the western edge of downtown, the Minneapolis Convention Center to the south and U.S. Bank Stadium to the east. The central crossroads for those core routes is the Crystal Court in IDS Center, where ESPN will be setting up its <a href="http://www.startribune.com/espn-chooses-ids-crystal-court-for-super-bowl-week-set/455860383/">main broadcast center</a>.</p>
<p>Along the core skyway routes, users will see “a lot of volunteers” giving directions until 10 p.m., Cramer said. More than 2,000 volunteers will be working the skyways during the Super Bowl festivities, with 120 on duty at all times. There will be prominent event signs with specific directions: “This way to U.S. Bank Stadium,” for example. </p>
<p>Planners are also running the final tests on a phone navigation app developed by Honeywell specifically for the Super Bowl. It will give turn-by-turn directions along the core skyway routes. </p>
<p>One ongoing skyway issue is a lack of consistency in operating hours. Each skyway is controlled by a specific building owner, and there are more than 60 different skyway owners along the entire system. They don’t always observe the same opening and closing hours. </p>
<p>Cramer said the Super Bowl committee is working with the various owners to negotiate uniform operating hours during the Super Bowl festivities. Skyways will stay open later than usual, he said, but there’s no final agreement yet on the time. </p>
<p>Kristen Montag, a communications manager for the tourism group Meet Minneapolis, expects that Super Bowl visitors will like their skyway experience, much as other visitors already do. </p>
<p>“The majority of feedback we get is positive,” she said. “People think they’re cool and unique. And because there are so many amenities in the skyway, people are intrigued by this whole other life that happens in our city.” </p>
<p>But the skyways aren’t for everyone. Mark Hughes of Shoreview, rolling down the Nicollet Mall in his wheelchair, said he actually finds the city sidewalks easier to navigate. His friend, Elisa Axiotis, said being outside is part of being Minnesotan. </p>
<p>“In the winter, you get all bundled up and then if you go in the skyway you have to take it off,” she said. “As long as you’re from Minnesota, you might as well enjoy the weather.” </p>

Amy Klobuchar pinned the Purple Heart on 93-year-old Minnesota World War II veteran Wayne Sundberg on Wednesday at the Veterans Services Building in St. Paul.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Before Gaye Sundberg died in 2014, she dreamed that one day her husband, World War II veteran Wayne Sundberg, would receive the Purple Heart medal he had clearly earned. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, on their 60th wedding anniversary, Sundberg, now 93, did just that. </p>
<p>In 1944, Staff Sgt. Sundberg, a B-26 turret gunner from Milaca, Minn., was shot down and captured by German forces, suffering shrapnel wounds in the ordeal, then was held as a prisoner of war for nine months before being liberated by Soviet troops at the end of the war. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., whose office helped Sundberg’s family secure the medal, pinned it on him at a ceremony at the Veterans Services Building in St. Paul, according to media reports. </p>
<p>“Wayne, like most soldiers, didn’t serve for the accolades or the attention,” Klobuchar said at the ceremony. “He didn’t stick around the base waiting for his Purple Heart to be awarded. He just went home to Minnesota.” </p>
<p>Sundberg’s son, Mark Sundberg, said that as his father was being discharged, he was told that he was entitled to the medal but would need to wait a couple of days for the paperwork. </p>
<p>“We knew he was a POW and had been hurt in the war, but he never got the medal,” Mark Sundberg said. “We had no proof he was wounded in combat. We had no way to verify he deserved the medal.” </p>
<p>Wayne and Gaye Sundberg lived for many years in Edina. Gaye died in 2014; Wayne now lives in Minneapolis. After they retired, Gaye started to look into her husband’s service history and found that Wayne’s military records had been destroyed in a 1973 fire. </p>
<p>After his mother died, Mark Sundberg, a high school teacher who lives in Ramsey, went looking through his father’s memorabilia. That’s when he found an old POW identification card written in German, which also said that Sundberg had been wounded. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, more than 72 years after the war ended, the old veteran, flanked by several generations of Sundbergs, finally received his Purple Heart. “To him, what matters most is that this was something my mom wanted,” said his proud son. </p>

<p>Kids across Minneapolis are playing badminton without racquets and sharing the same jersey number at soccer games. They’re piling into Grandma’s minivan to get to practice or games across town. </p>
<p>For the city’s thousands of teens, school sports have become a do-it-yourself effort as the effect of back-to-back budget deficits shows up at Minneapolis Public Schools’ fields, courts and swimming pools. Cutbacks are coming right in the middle of sports seasons and prompting unease as next school year’s $33 million deficit looms. </p>
<p>“People had to rely on parents and coordinate,” said Emma Schluter, a Minneapolis South High School senior and soccer captain. “It’s definitely something that became much more of an issue for ourselves, rather than the school district supporting us.” </p>
<p>This year, every high school lost a football and volleyball coach. Parents tick off the problems their kids are facing: too few uniforms, buses and coaches. </p>
<p>Middle school sports have also been slashed. Schools are left to grapple with the fallout from a 14 percent cut to athletic funding last year and pinched athletic finances for the past few years. They expect to dip into carry-over funds to match expenses. </p>

<p>The district reports it isn’t seeing some of the parents’ examples of cutbacks. Shortages arose because of several factors, including budget tightening, said student support services executive director Keith Brooks. </p>
<p>Donovann Bower, a sophomore at Roosevelt High School, said his junior varsity soccer team played with mismatched jerseys this year. With money tight, the school prioritizes the varsity team, he said. His mother, Jeanette Bower, plans annual car washes to help kids earn money for sweatshirts. </p>
<p>“If I can, as a parent, raise money for my kids on the side to provide things that the school can’t provide, then I’m going to do everything I can do to raise that money,” Bower said. </p>
<p>Athletes like senior Maddy Tennant, the other South High School soccer captain, feel the financial disparities when playing suburban competitors on their fields. In the suburbs athletes often have better stadiums, and some have had access to competitive sports since they were much younger. </p>
<p>“I wonder how much better we would be if we had the same resources,” Tennant said. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Looming budget concerns</strong></h3>
<p>This year, Edison High School had to turn away soccer players because it couldn’t afford a third boys’ coach. These and other shortages have prompted parents such as Greg Oliver to point to what they call inequity issues. </p>
<p>While district athletic officials say every high school gets the same funding for coaches per sport, schools can build on that amount through a combination of student participation fees, gate fees and grant funds. Schools with winning teams, wide community support and the facilities to host evening games can raise extra money that can pay for extra coaches and sports supplies. </p>
<p>In response to complaints about “haves and have-nots,” the school board directed the district to study the differences in sports funding and present its results in the coming months. District athletics officials said they have heard comments about fairness. </p>
<p>“When kids have fewer opportunities when they’re young, we see the results in the classroom and we see the results on our high school teams,” said board treasurer Jenny Arneson at a fall board meeting. Arneson has championed the study. </p>
<p>The revenue numbers can be examined in different ways, yet disparities show up each time. </p>
<p>For example, Washburn High School will make more than double the North Side schools when total revenue is considered. But that changes when the number of student athletes is factored in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><style type="text/css">.embed iframe{height:400px;} @media only screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 767px){.embed iframe {height:425px;}}</style></p>
<div><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="400" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wcPBU/2/" width="100%"></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>A Star Tribune analysis of projected per-student athlete revenue at high schools shows that two of the poorest schools, North and Roosevelt, will bring in the most per-student money, thanks in part to low student participation numbers. Roosevelt also benefits from evening games on its lighted field, and Minneapolis North High School enjoys strong ticket sales with its string of recent state championships in football and basketball. </p>
<p>The higher household incomes on the South Side make it easier for families to raise money to supplement what the district can provide. But that prompts more parent questions: Is it fair that wealthier schools can raise outside funds to plug budget gaps? Should the district pool all schools’ revenue, carrying money from revenue-rich schools to those with less? </p>
<p>This kind of variation is inevitable, the school district says. Yet parents districtwide say sports are critical to keeping kids in school. </p>
<p>Sports have “a huge impact” on academic success, too, said district athletic director Trent Tucker. That’s why Minneapolis district policy states that all students can play, regardless of their ability to pay the participation fee — generally $60 per sport, though reduced if a student qualifies for lunch subsidies. </p>
<p>“The beauty of athletics is that it coincides with academics,” Tucker said. “Those two are like a marriage.” </p>

<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Uncertain futures</strong></h3>
<p>What lies ahead for athletics is unclear as Superintendent Ed Graff and Minneapolis officials figure out what will go to fix next year’s budget deficit. </p>
<p>“We have a grand opportunity in terms of our $33 million deficit to look at our core values as a district and look holistically at the students,” Brooks said. </p>
<p>The thought of more cuts to already slim programs makes parents uneasy. South High soccer parent Scott Schluter said students are picking up on the budget cuts. </p>
<p>“The ones that are older that are aware of it feel frustrated that they don’t know exactly what’s going to happen,” Schluter said. </p>
<p>At Southwest High School, Jeanne Erickson Cooley drove students on the C and junior varsity baseball teams to games last year — though her own son played on the varsity team. If the district’s financial troubles force more cuts, she said she’s not sure what more the parents can do. </p>
<p>“Teenagers — it’s so freaking hard for them,” she said. “This is the thing that kept my kids going.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Decades ago, Richfield police took a risk, becoming one of the first five law enforcement agencies in Minnesota to assign officers to 12-hour shifts. </p>
<p>With the lengthy shifts came impressive payoffs — a calendar filled with more time off, including three- or four-day breaks to catch up on sleep, help out at home or socialize. </p>
<p>“We’ve been doing it for 25 years now,” said Deputy Chief Mike Koob of the Richfield Police Department. “I think we’d have a revolt if we ever went back.” </p>
<p>Over the past 10 to 15 years, other Minnesota police departments slowly began making the switch to longer shifts over fewer days. </p>
<p>Inver Grove Heights, Blaine, Lakeville and Ramsey police went to 12-hour shifts in the past six years. Hastings cops will do so next year. </p>
<p>“It’s becoming more commonplace in law enforcement,” said Lt. Brian Tholen of the Edina Police Department. “It’s nice to have the time for officers to go home and spend quality time with their family.” </p>

<p>No one tracks police schedules statewide. An informal phone survey found metro-area departments divided between 10- and 12-hour schedules, though some have hybrid shifts. West St. Paul police work a 9½-hour schedule. Cottage Grove will shift from 10½ hours to 11 hours next year. </p>
<p>In Minneapolis, officers work either eight or 10 hours, depending on their job. St. Paul police put in 10-hour shifts. </p>
<p>Most police officials say the officers prefer the arrangement over a conventional eight-hour day, citing improved mental health, increased productivity and more coverage during peak times. </p>
<p>But not everyone is a fan. Lurking behind its appeal are worries about fatigue, which some studies and sleep experts say could hamper judgment or lead to accidents in a profession with high stakes. </p>
<p>“The longer you work, the more it’s going to impact your potential sleep,” said Dr. Michael Howell, a University of Minnesota neurologist. “For police officers, the question is also life and death.” </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Research results mixed</strong></h3>
<p>The Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association and Law Enforcement Labor Services — Minnesota’s largest police union — have taken no position on the issue. Schedules don’t usually affect contract negotiations, union officials said. </p>
<p>Duty rotations can be complex and vary by department. </p>
<p>A 550-page, three-ring binder filled with sample schedules sits on the desk of Capt. Greg Rinzel of the Cottage Grove Police Department, demonstrating how many options exist. “It’s been studied almost to the point of nauseam,” Rinzel said. </p>
<p>Research has reached mixed conclusions. A 2011 study by the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research organization, compared experiences of officers in Detroit and Arlington, Texas, who were randomly assigned eight-, 10- and 12-hour shifts. The study found that officers working 10 hours performed better on measurable tasks. Those working 12 hours said they were sleepier and less alert at work than those working eight hours. Even so, the authors found that the longer schedules “do not raise significant concerns.” </p>
<p>A study published in 2008 by Police Chief magazine (the International Association of Chiefs of Police periodical) examined the results when part of the Lincoln Police Department in Nebraska switched to 12-hour shifts. Most measures, from productivity to discipline rates, remained the same. Every officer preferred the longer schedule, and the study concluded that 12-hour shifts were a “viable scheduling alternative.” </p>
<p>Yet while all of the officers said they could perform under the schedule, 13 percent acknowledged there had been times when they couldn’t function safely. </p>
<p>That’s what concerns Chief Bud Shaver in West St. Paul. </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t consider going to a 12-hour shift,” Shaver said. “After an extended work period, an officer’s work performance and decision-making skills tend to diminish.” </p>
<p>There are other snags. Court days can become complicated, especially when an officer works 12 hours, gets off at 6 a.m., and has court the next morning or afternoon. “Your sleep gets broken up,” said Sgt. Jeff Warner of the Blaine Police Department. </p>
<p>Officials said long shifts mean that on workdays, officers must accept that there’s only time for work and sleep. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Work-life balance</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly everyone interviewed by the Star Tribune said that while there are downsides, the pluses of longer shifts outweigh the minuses. Officials from eight departments said they don’t believe their schedule results in overtired officers. Many said they monitor the issue. </p>
<p>Before Elk River police debuted 12-hour shifts in 2004, Chief Ron Nierenhausen said skeptics predicted that officers would take more sick days and be less productive. That didn’t happen, he said. </p>
<p>Nierenhausen said officers are polled yearly about the schedules, and they opt to stay with 12-hour shifts. </p>
<p>Longer shifts mean more officers on the street when they’re needed, said South St. Paul Chief William Messerich, whose department started the arrangement in 2005. He said other shift schedules sometimes resulted in officers doubled up in squad cars unnecessarily. The 12-hour shifts make it easier for most officers to achieve a good work-life balance, Messerich said. </p>
<p>“There have certainly been officers that have difficulty with their 12-hour shifts,” Messerich said. “It balances out though — an off day is just around the corner.” </p>
<p>The Inver Grove Heights City Council heard a presentation by then-Interim Chief Sean Folmar in early December summarizing the department’s first year with 12-hour shifts. Folmar listed benefits of the system, including boosted morale, having a supervisor on duty 24 hours a day and more efficient training because the department can train in two days instead spreading it over five days as before. </p>
<p>Residents have asked if the department hired more officers, noting they’re more visible now, Folmar said. </p>
<p>Officer-initiated activities — checking on suspicious cars, traffic stops, patrolling crime hot spots — are up 144 percent to 8,959 in 2017 from 3,671 in 2016. Folmar said the only drawback is that officers use less vacation time. </p>
<p>Police officials caution that what works for one department might prove ineffective elsewhere, depending on department size, call volumes and organizational culture. </p>
<p>“Every city is unique,” said Sean Gormley, Law Enforcement Labor Services’ executive director. “Once an agency finds something that works, it’s hard to break that up.” </p>

<p>Overheard in the Dallas Stars’ locker room before the game, here was center Tyler Seguin’s assessment of facing the Wild: “Both teams wear green.” </p>
<p>He’s not wrong. </p>
<p>Turns out, there were a few more differences than similarities Wednesday when the Wild turned in a confident 4-2 victory at Xcel Energy Center in front of an announced crowd of 19,107. That’s a bit of a twist, considering the exact tint of Dallas’ color is “victory” green. </p>
<p>The Wild improved to 19-15-3 while the Stars fell to 20-15-3 — just two points ahead of Minnesota — in the stacked Central Division. </p>
<p>“Well, I mean, I didn’t want to talk about it being a huge game, but it was a huge game,” Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. “We called it the start of the second half [of the season]. So you get a chance to reset. And I likened it this morning to a game of golf here. You play the first nine holes and probably are not as happy as you’d like to be. But you can always make it up on the back nine. I mean, it was only one game, but it was a good divisional start.” </p>

<p>Seguin started off his team’s scoring with 12 minutes, 37 seconds remaining in the first period, redirecting defenseman Esa Lindell’s shot past Wild goaltender Alex Stalock. Wild defenseman Jared Spurgeon tied the score with less than a minute to go in the period, burying a rebound from winger Charlie Coyle’s initial shot. </p>
<p>While it took both teams most of that first period to shake off their three-day holiday break, the action picked up in the second 20 minutes. On an odd-man rush, Wild center Eric Staal scored at 5:12 thanks to an inadvertent assist from Stars defenseman Greg Pateryn. Wild defenseman Matt Dumba then tried to draw unlucky Pateryn into the celebration, which did not go over well. </p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, I was not paying attention, but I saw a couple fists coming in,” winger Tyler Ennis said of Dumba’s move. “But, no, it was a good goal and a great game.” </p>
<p>Stars winger Mattias Janmark scored 10 seconds into a power-play about halfway through the second period when a wide shot from Seguin bounced off the boards and right to him. But the Wild returned the favor with a 10-second power-play goal of its own at 13:08 by winger Mikael Granlund, making it 3-2 Wild. </p>
<p>Spurgeon looked to have scored his second goal of the night with a wraparound buzzer-beater, but the officials ruled that time had expired. </p>
<p>The third period was scoreless until Wild winger Jason Zucker got an empty-net goal in the last minute. </p>
<p>Before the game, Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said it would be interesting to see how his team responded to a weird day of travel after the time off as well as a different take on the morning skate and team meetings because of it. </p>
<p>He also worried about how his team would emotionally connect after the break, especially since he said there is “no gray area” to the Stars, as they either play exactly like they should or are completely hapless. Wednesday, it was the latter. </p>
<p>“It was our poorest effort by a mile,” Hitchcock said. “We were light everywhere. Light on the puck. Light around our net. Light around their net. This looked like the way we played a month and a half ago.” </p>
<p>For the Wild, it was the opposite. </p>
<p>“You could tell we had a bit more confidence tonight,” Spurgeon said. “Guys were handling the puck, and I thought all lines were going as well. Everyone was clicking, and there wasn’t one person that wasn’t doing the job they were supposed to. </p>
<p>“We know the position we’re in and how big the second half is for us,” Spurgeon said. “We’re going to have to win a lot of games for the playoff push, and that’s what we’re trying to start off with right now.” </p>

<p>Wednesday morning the Timberwolves revealed their fourth uniform. Called the “City Edition,” it is mainly gray. After Wednesday night’s game against Denver, the team should consider a fifth. Called the “Jimmy Butler Edition,” it would feature a cape. </p>
<p>He did it again. </p>
<p>After 2½ quarters of beautiful basketball — and an 18-point Wolves lead — had degenerated into a do-or-die overtime, Butler scored 12 of Minnesota’s 14 points in overtime, dishing the ball to Jamal Crawford for the ultimate game-winner in a 128-125 victory over the Nuggets that pushed Minnesota’s winning streak to five games. </p>
<p>Superman struck again. </p>
<p>“I’ve been saying this all year,” Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said after it was over. “I’m hoping everyone is recognizing how special he is. He’s changed everything for us. Big play after big play, guards everyone. Hustle plays. Tough rebounds. Everything.” </p>
<p>That about sums it up. </p>

                  Timberwolves guard Jimmy Butler attempted a three-pointer but was fouled by Nuggets guard Torrey Craig in the second quarter. Butler finished with a game-high 39 points in the Wolves’ 128-125 victory in overtime at Target Center.
              </div>

      <ul>
              </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
<p></p>
<p>Butler had 39 points, with 12 coming in the 5-minute overtime, seven of them from the line. He also got two huge overtime rebounds and the game-winning assist. </p>
<p>“Thibs, all the coaches, my teammates, they told me to keep going,” Butler said. “I was really, really locked in. That’s the scary part about it.” </p>
<p>He did it with Karl-Anthony Towns (14 points, 13 rebounds) having fouled out in the fourth quarter, with Taj Gibson (20 points) fouled out in the first minute in overtime, and with starting point guard Jeff Teague (11 points, 10 assists) out because of an injured left knee that will undergo an MRI Thursday. Butler did it after the Wolves had squandered a 19-point first-half lead, an 18-point lead with 4 minutes to go in the third quarter and a nine-point lead with 2:50 left in regulation. </p>
<p>Denver’s Will Barton (28 points) had forced overtime with two free throws with 5.5 seconds left. </p>
<p>Butler decided his team wouldn’t lose. </p>
<p>“He just imposed his will,” Crawford said. “He really did. He literally willed us.” </p>
<p>And all after Gary Harris’ three-pointer to open the OT gave Denver its biggest lead (three) of the game. </p>
<p>Butler hit two free throws with 4:12 left. After Nikola Jokic (22 points) scored, Butler was fouled on a three-point attempt and made two. After Trey Lyles’ dunk, Butler’s two free throws with 1:46 left tied the score. </p>
<p>At the other end Butler grabbed the rebound of Jokic’s miss, then scored on a 14-footer. Two Jokic free throws with 1:06 left tied the score for the last time, then Butler got the ball to Crawford for what turned out to be the game-winner. </p>
<p>He was going to shoot, he said. But Crawford, open, kept yelling his name. </p>
<p>“I really was going to shoot,” Butler said. “But if Jamal screams, ‘Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy,’ that means he’s open. He did what he’s done for us all year. He made the shot.” </p>
<p>With the sellout crowd of 18,978 chanting MVP, Butler hit one free throw with 16.9 seconds left to finish the scoring. </p>
<p>This has been Butler’s habit this month, during which he has scored 30 or more points in 13 December games. Thibodeau, who coached Butler in Chicago, said he believes Butler is playing the best ball of his career. </p>
<p>Wednesday he simply leapt a tall opponent in a single bound. Bring on the cape. </p>
<p>“When his best is needed, he’s always at his best,” Thibodeau said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Democrat Doug Jones’ historic victory over Republican Roy Moore was declared official Thursday as Alabama election officials certified him the winner of the special Senate election, despite Moore’s last-minute lawsuit claiming voter fraud. </p>
<p>Jones defeated Moore on Dec. 12 by 21,924 votes in a stunning victory in a traditionally red state, becoming the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate victory in a quarter-century. The win came after Moore, best known for stands against gay marriage and the public display of the Ten Commandments, was dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls that occurred decades ago. </p>
<p>Jones said in a statement that he looked forward to going to work for the people of Alabama in the new year. </p>
<p>“As I said on election night, our victory marks a new chapter for our state and the nation,” he said. “I will be an independent voice and work to find common ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get Washington back on track and fight to make our country a better place for all.” </p>
<p>Jones will be sworn in on Jan. 3, narrowing the GOP’s advantage in the U.S. Senate to 51-49. He takes over the seat previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. </p>
<p>In a brief meeting Thursday at the Alabama Capitol, the governor, attorney general and secretary of state signed paperwork certifying the final ballot numbers. It was a quiet punctuation mark to a tumultuous election marked by the misconduct accusations and Moore’s eleventh-hour legal fight. </p>
<p>Moore had refused to concede his loss to Jones and filed a last-ditch lawsuit hours before the certification, saying he believed there were voting irregularities that should be investigated. A judge denied his request to stop the election certification. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said his office has so far found no evidence of fraud. </p>
<p>In a brief statement, Moore stood by his claims that the election was fraudulent and said he had to fight Democrats and over $50 million in opposition spending from the Washington establishment. He said he had no regrets. </p>
<p>“I have stood for the truth about God and the Constitution for the people of Alabama,” he said. </p>
<p>On election night, Moore had pegged his hopes on votes from military serviceman and provisional ballots. The official numbers certified Thursday showed that Jones slightly expanded his lead over Moore. Jones had a lead of 20,715 in the unofficial returns and was ahead 21,924 in the certified result. In all, more than 1.3 million people voted in the special election, including 22,850 write-in votes. </p>
<p>Jones is a former U.S. attorney best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for Birmingham’s infamous 1963 church bombing. </p>
<p>As he launched his campaign, he said he saw an opening for a rare Democratic win against Moore, a polarizing figure in the state. Moore was a twice removed from the position of chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Once was for defying a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. And he was permanently suspended last year for urging probate judges to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples in defiance of federal court rulings. </p>
<p>Moore’s campaign was deeply wounded by the sexual misconduct accusations. Moore denied the accusations and said in the lawsuit that he had passed a polygraph test to prove they are false. </p>
<p>Moore’s attorney wrote in the wide-ranging complaint that he believed there were irregularities during the election, including that voters may have been brought in from other states. He attached a statement from a poll worker that she had noticed licenses from Georgia and North Carolina as people signed in to vote. The complaint also noted the higher-than-expected turnout in the race, particularly in Jefferson County. </p>
<p>“This is not a Republican or Democrat issue as election integrity should matter to everyone,” Moore said in a statement Wednesday. </p>
<p>Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, said Moore’s complaint did not raise the sort of issues that lead courts to overturn an election. He said Moore’s complaint might just be a way for him to fundraise and throw “red meat to his loyal supporters.” </p>
<p>Merrill said Moore has a few options left, such as offering to pay for a recount within 48 hours. </p>
<p>“I can say this. I don’t think there is any doubt from the minds of anybody that’s in the room that if there was ever a question about whether Alabama conducts honest, fair election safe and secure elections, that question has been eliminated,” Merrill said. </p>

<p>A light covering of snow was all it took to turn Thursday’s morning commute into a slippery drive as slick roads led to scores of crashes and spinouts. </p>
<p>At 8:30 a.m., more than 30 incidents snarled traffic, including a car vs. semitrailer truck crash on northbound I-35W at County Road I in Mounds View. Between 5 and 8 a.m., MnDOT’s traveler information site <a href="http://www.511mn.org/">511mn.org</a> has listed more than 50 crashes or spin outs.</p>
<p>It was not the amount of snow, less than an inch in most places across the metro, but temperatures hovering around zero made for treacherous driving. </p>
<p>MnDOT has warned drivers early this morning to expect a much slower commute as chemicals are not as effective when temperatures sink to zero or below. </p>
<p>“Plows out in metro clearing snow, dropping salt,” MnDOT spokesman Kevin Gutknecht said in a tweet before the commute got started. “Temps may create slick spots. Take it slow this a.m., arrive dent free.” </p>
<p>The agency issued the usual advice: Keep the speeds down. MnDOT also reminded drivers to clear the snow off of headlights and tail lights before putting their car in drive. </p>
<p>Hennepin County has 71 plows out clearing snow and laying anti-icing materials on county roads. </p>
<p>By 6 a.m. snow totals were 0.4 inches in St. Cloud and at the weather service’s offices in Chanhassen, and 0.2 inches at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. </p>
<p>Behind the snow, another surge of bitterly cold air will arrive Thursday night and persist into Monday, the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>Windchill readings are forecast to reach -30 degrees in the metro area Saturday morning and -22 degrees on Sunday morning. </p>
<p>“Frostbite can set in in as little as 15 minutes on any exposed skin with wind chills of 25 below or colder,” the weather service warned. And that is the situation most of Minnesota will face . </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">The Vikings should dismiss Dead Bears Walking as easily as they swatted aside Dead Bengals Walking at home a couple of weeks ago.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Mark Craig</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23124558/tdcelebration.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23124558/tdcelebration.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Week 17 is never an easy week to pick NFL games. (As if any week is, eh?) </p>
<p>Teams with nothing to play for typically play that way. So, with that in mind, do you take, for example, an eight-win Cowboys team and give 2 1/2 points at Philadelphia, where the Eagles have 13 wins and homefield advantage in the NFC locked up? </p>
<p>I suppose the Eagles will rest some players. But how much? This is, after all, a team that lost its franchise quarterback three weeks ago. So you also have to consider the momentum factor heading into the playoffs while trying to gauge how the Eagles will treat Sunday’s game. </p>
<p>Jacksonville-Tennessee is another intriguing line. Jacksonville, which has 10 wins and a division title, is getting 6 1/2 points at Tennessee, which has eight wins, but has lost three straight and four of six. Yes, Tennessee is playing for its playoff life, but Jacksonville also is coming off a 44-33 loss to the 49ers. </p>
<p>The Week 16 picks didn’t prove to be all that tough last week. (Although no money was placed where mouth was). The picks here went 12-4 straight-up and 11-5 against the spread. The Upset Not-So-Special dropped to 3-12 on the season when the Raiders didn’t beat the Eagles. Give me Jags over Titans this week. You’re welcome, Tennessee. </p>
<p>I sorta missed on the Patriots. Said they’d win by 20 and they won by 21. This week, as 15 ½-point favorites against the Jets, I’m going to say New England by 28. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, the Browns aren’t the biggest underdog on the board. (Hey, baby steps, Cleveland. Baby steps). They’re getting 13 1/2 at Pittsburgh. I’ll say Steelers by 21 as the Brownies match the 2008 Lions as the only 0-16 teams in NFL history. </p>
<p>As for the Vikings, well, let’s just say they won’t be giving John Fox the same coaching sendoff that the Bears gave Mike Tice back in 2005. </p>
<p>Here are this week’s games … </p>
<p><strong>Bears plus-12 1/2 at Vikings: </strong>Vikings 37, Bears 10</p>
<p>The Vikings should dismiss Dead Bears Walking as easily as they swatted aside Dead Bengals Walking at home a couple of weeks ago. The most likely wrench to be thrown into this scenario would be early sloppiness on the part of the Vikings’ No. 2-ranked run defense. If Jordan Howard, the NFL’s fifth-leading rusher, gets going, the Bears might gain interest in the game. Throw in a few unexpected turnovers and some drive-killing penalties, and the Vikings could lose. But don’t bet on it. I’d give the 12 ½ points. </p>
<p><strong>Cowboys minus-2 1/2 at Eagles:</strong> Cowboys by 3</p>
<p><strong>Redskins minus-3 1/2 at Giants: </strong>Redskins by 7</p>
<p><strong>Packers plus-7 1/2 at Lions: </strong>Lions by 10</p>
<p><strong>Browns plus-13 1/2 at Steelers:</strong> Steelers by 21</p>
<p><strong>Texans plus-4 1/2 at Colts: </strong>Colts by 7</p>
<p><strong>Jets plus-15 1/2 at Patriots: </strong>Patriots by 28</p>
<p><strong>Bengals plus-9 1/2 at Ravens: </strong>Ravens by 3</p>
<p><strong>Cardinals plus-7 1/2 at Seahawks: </strong>Seahawks by 9</p>
<p><strong>Chiefs plus-3 1/2 at Broncos: </strong>Chiefs by 7</p>
<p><strong>Raiders plus-8 1/2 at Chargers: </strong>Chargers by 14</p>
<p><strong>Saints minus-7 1/2 at Buccaneers: </strong>Saints by 14</p>
<p><strong>Panthers plus-3 1/2 at Falcons: </strong>Panthers by 7</p>
<p><strong>49ers plus-4 1/2 at Rams: </strong>Rams by 3</p>
<p><strong> Bills minus-2 1/2 at Dolphins: </strong>Dolphins by 3</p>
<p><strong>UPSET SPECIAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jaguars plus-6 1/2 at Titans: </strong>Jaguars 24, Titans 14</p>
<p>Yeah, the Titans have more to play for. A win and they’re in the playoffs. But they’ve had things to play for the past three weeks and have lost each game. They lost to Arizona and the 49ers. The Jaguars already own a playoff berth and a division title. But they’re also going to want to regain some momentum from giving up 44 points in a loss to the 49ers last week. </p>
<p><strong>Last week straight up; versus spread:</strong> 12-4; 11-5</p>
<p><strong>Year to date:</strong> 155-83; 115-124</p>
<p><strong>Upset specials: </strong>3-13</p>
<p><strong>Record picking Vikings games: </strong>10-5</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By ALEX VEIGA — Associated Press</h4>
<p>U.S. stock indexes were up slightly in light trading late Thursday afternoon, on course to extend modest gains as the market heads into the final trading day of 2017. Banks were among the big gainers. Energy companies also rose following a spike in natural gas prices. Consumer-goods makers lagged the most. Oil prices closed higher. </p>
<p>KEEPING SCORE: The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index was up 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,684 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern Time.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 2 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,546. </p>
<p>THE QUOTE: “It’s a light, light, light calendar,” said John Serrapere, director of research at Arrow Funds. “Normally between Christmas and New Year’s you get a positive, muted upslope in the markets.” </p>
<p>FINANCIALS CLIMB: Banks and other financial companies rose as bond yields rose. Northern Trust added $1.29, or 1.3 percent, to $99.97. </p>
<p>BINGE THIS: Netflix was among the big gainers in the S&amp;P 500. The video-streaming service rose $7.34, or 4 percent, to $193.58. </p>

<p>ROUGH ROAD: Shares in JB Hunt Transportation Services declined after the trucking company issued a disappointing fourth-quarter profit forecast. JB Hunt expects to take about $40 million in one-time charges for the quarter. The stock fell 80 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $114.68. </p>
<p>LACKLUSTER QUARTER: Calumet Specialty Products Partners tumbled 10.7 percent after the oil and solvents processor reported disappointing third-quarter results. The stock gave up 95 cents to $7.90. </p>
<p>OIL &amp; GAS: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 20 cents to settle at $59.84 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained 28 cents to $66.72 per barrel in London. Natural gas prices surged as temperatures dropped in the U.S. Natural gas rose 18 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. </p>
<p>The pickup in natural gas prices helped drive gains for some energy companies. Chesapeake Energy added 17 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $4.05, while Range Resources gained 66 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $17.61. </p>
<p>METALS: Gold rose $5.80 to $1,297.20 an ounce. Silver added 17 cents, or 1 percent, to $16.92 an ounce. Copper climbed 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.31 a pound. </p>
<p>BOND YIELDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.43 percent from 2.41 percent late Wednesday. </p>

Bitcoin futures on the Cboe Futures Exchange slid 7.8 percent to $13,780. South Korea’s government announced additional measures Thursday to curb speculative trading of virtual currencies in the country, including a ban on opening anonymous accounts. </p>
<p>MARKETS OVERSEAS: Major indexes in Europe closed lower. Germany’s DAX slipped 0.7 percent, while France’s CAC 40, lost 0.6 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose less than 0.1 percent, but the gain was enough for the index to close at a record high. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 erased earlier gains to finish 0.6 percent lower. South Korea’s Kospi surged 1.3 percent after government data showed strong gains in retail sales and industrial output last month. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent. </p>

<p>Talk about “lake effect.” </p>
<p>The weather system that delivered a dusting of snow over Minnesota and record-setting snowfall in the East was captured in an impressive satellite photo posted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). </p>

<p></p>
<p>The photo shows a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/imagery-and-data">“cloud streets”</a> that stretched across the Great Lakes region on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>“These parallel rows of clouds, known as ‘cloud streets’ streaming over the Great Lakes on Christmas Day 2017 … helped deliver record-setting snowfall in Erie, Pa., where more than 60 inches of snow fell over a two-day period.” </p>
<p>Strong westerly winds over Lake Erie picked up moisture, developed into snow and converged with opposing winds, dumping snow in a band along the shore from Ohio to New York, said Zach Sefcovic, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Cleveland. </p>
<p>Sabrina Ram drove into Erie on Christmas Eve to visit her parents just as the snow began to fall. Ram, who lives in suburban Washington, D.C., and her father spent five hours on Christmas and two hours on Tuesday clearing the driveway. </p>
<p>“In D.C., we’d be out of commission for weeks,” Ram said. “Things here are pretty much back to normal now.” </p>
<p>In New York, communities near Lake Ontario’s eastern end, including Redfield and Boylston, also saw around 5 feet of snow this week. </p>
<p>Officials said the storm’s timing was good, since people were off the streets and staying home for Christmas, giving plows more space to clear streets. </p>
<p>By Wednesday, Erie’s roads were relatively clear, emergency calls were relatively slow and the big task was digging out, County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper said. </p>
<p>“We’re used to a lot of snow here in Erie, but this is unprecedented, the amount we got,” Dahlkemper said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Not waiting to capture their suspect, authorities have charged a Burnsville man with abducting his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint outside her Minnetonka workplace and fleeing. </p>
<p>Jahon K. Douglas, 37, of Burnsville, was charged Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court with kidnapping, assault with a dangerous weapon and first-degree robbery in connection with the abduction of Nicole Smith, also 37, of Anoka. </p>
<p>Smith had been missing since Dec. 21, when she was seen being kidnapped outside her workplace on Bren Road about 4 p.m., according to police. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Smith persuaded Douglas to let her go, and she returned to her parents’ home in Anoka in Douglas’ car that afternoon, police said Thursday afternoon. She was physically unharmed. </p>
<p>“Our officers continue to work diligently to locate Jahon Douglas,” Police Chief Scott Boerboom said in a statement. “We are working closely with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate any information that could lead to his whereabouts.” </p>
<p>Police have declined to disclose her whereabouts while she was missing or how she persuaded Douglas to release her. </p>
<p>For the first time since the abduction a week ago, police on Thursday released a description of Douglas. He is black, 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair. </p>
<p>The pair have had a history of domestic turmoil, police said. She told police that Douglas planned to kill her and then himself, the criminal complaint read. </p>
<p>A week ago Thursday, Smith and a co-worker got in a car outside Minneapolis Mart, a showroom facility for wholesale home decor on Bren, just northwest of where Hwys. 212 and 62 meet. </p>
<p>Douglas climbed in the back seat, pointed a gun at the co-worker’s head and said to start driving. Douglas then pointed the gun at Smith and “threatened to blow her head off,” the charges read. </p>
<p>Smith got out of the car, and Douglas followed and forced her into his car, the complaint continued. </p>
<p>Police have yet to recover a weapon and said he should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information on Douglas’ location is asked to call 911. </p>
<p>Douglas’ criminal history in Minnesota spans his adult life and includes two cases that are active in Anoka County: one filed in October alleging that he fled police while driving drunk and possessing marijuana, and the other filed a week earlier on charges of fleeing police and threatening violence. </p>
<p>He’s been convicted three times in the state for assault, four times for illicit drug crimes, twice for drunken driving, once each for violating a court order for protection, property damage and disorderly conduct, and more than 20 times for driving after having license revoked. </p>

<p>Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been named the organization’s general manager, in addition to receiving a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday. </p>
<p>Reeve has led the Lynx to four WNBA titles in eight seasons. She was recently named the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports-person-of-the-year-cheryl-reeve-lynx-s-transformer-in-chief/466321813/">Star Tribune’s Sportsperson of the Year</a>. </p>
<p>Reeve has a 195-77 record. Her promotion to GM makes her the sixth coach in the WNBA to hold the dual roles. </p>
<p>The Lynx made a number of other organizational moves on Thursday, as well. </p>
<p>Claire Duwelius, who held the role of basketball operations manager, is the now assistant general manager. Lynx assistant coaches Shelley Patterson and Walt Hopkins have agreed to contract extensions. Assistant coach James Wade remains on the staff. </p>
<p>“I appreciate Glen Taylor’s confidence in me to continue to lead the Lynx organization,” Reeve said. “I’m thrilled with the strong and passionate staff we’ve assembled and look forward to the challenges that lie ahead.” </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Smith is leaving the DMC board to take over the U.S. Senate seat now held by Al Franken.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Matt McKinney</h4>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tina Smith resigned Thursday as chairwoman of the board of directors for Mayo Clinic’s $5.6 billion expansion, known as Destination Medical Center (DMC). </p>
<p>Smith, who has served as the board’s chairwoman since its inception in 2013, submitted her resignation in letters to Gov. Mark Dayton and DMC directors. Smith was appointed by Dayton earlier this month to take over the U.S. Senate seat now occupied by Al Franken. </p>
<p>Former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, the vice chair, will take over as interim chair. </p>
<p>The DMC project, which blends private investment with public money to fuel growth over 20 years, originally was pitched as a needed step to keep Mayo competitive with other world-class medical centers. </p>
<p>Mayo will expand its campus and extend its medical know-how with $3.5 billion in investments over the course of DMC’s life span, while private investors are expected to add another $2.1 billion in residential, retail and commercial investments. About $585 million in tax money will build the public infrastructure necessary to tie it all together. </p>
<p>The plan calls for adding more than 30,000 jobs in Rochester, adding tens of thousands of people to the city’s population and generating billions in tax revenue. </p>
<p>The expansion took off in earnest last year with multiple construction projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Some 14 construction projects worth an estimated $736.8 million are either planned or in the works or have recently been completed in the roughly 550-acre zone delineated for renovations and new construction. </p>
<p>“I am proud of the work we accomplished together, and am confident that under your leadership DMC can continue to move ahead,” Smith wrote in a letter to the board of directors. “During the past four years we have made significant progress … </p>
<p>“These accomplishments are a testament to the leadership of this board and the hard work and ingenuity of the people of Rochester who made this city a global health care destination.” </p>
<p>In a statement Thursday, Dayton called Smith a “tremendous champion” for the DMC expansion, adding that she “has been crucial to the project’s successes.” </p>

                                    </div>
<h3>Kenneth Tam: Cold Open </h3>
<p>The Minneapolis Institute of Art quietly unveiled these <a href="https://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/kenneth-tam/">three video works</a> on the Saturday before Christmas. In “The compression is not subservient to the explosion; it gives it increased force” (2011), the New York artist orchestrates a relationship between himself and a man he met online — except the man is inside a cardboard box, with holes carved for his arms. The viewer never sees him. Together they negotiate boundaries and consent, two types of conversations we don’t usually see played out between men (sexual or otherwise). In “sump” (2015), Tam and his father play with created rituals, from painting circles on each other’s bellies to blowing up balloons. Their shared physicality reveals more about their relationship than dialogue could. “Breakfast in Bed” (2016), a 32-minute video that only screens on Thursday and Sundays, explores the group and performative dynamics of masculinity as a social construct. Tam will visit the museum for a talk at 6:30 p.m. Jan. 18 with curator Gabriel Ritter. (10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tue.-Wed. &amp; Sat.-Sun., 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Thu.-Fri. Ends April 8. 2400 3rd Av. S., Mpls. new.artsmia.org or 1-888-642-2787.)</p>

<p><span>As 2017 approaches its end</span></p>
<p><span>The time has come to re-recommend</span></p>
<p><span>Some movies that you might have missed.</span></p>
<p><span>So take a sec and scan this list.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve skipped any of these movies,</span></p>
<p><span>Too bad. They’re worth their weight in rubies.</span></p>
<p><span>They still remain on screens near you</span></p>
<p><span>Weeks beyond their grand debut.</span></p>
<p><span>Take family, pals, acquaintances, fraternity,</span></p>
<p><span>‘Cause nothing good will last eternally.</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because after the holidays you like a good angry-mom movie …</strong></p>
<p>Line up a double feature because you’re in luck. </p>
<p>Greta Gerwig’s <strong style="font-weight: 500;">“Lady Bird”</strong> is more than the blossoming of her remarkable gifts as a screenwriter and director; it’s an engaging character comedy with complicated emotional clout.</p>
<p>There is almost nonstop verbal sparring between Saoirse Ronan as the cool-nerd title character, who’s eager to flee high school, California and everything else in her early life, and Laurie Metcalf as her strong-willed, deeply opinionated mom, a nurse working double shifts to keep the family afloat after her husband loses his job. To watch these imperfect, vexing, lovable women volley dialogue — “I want to go where culture is, like New York.” “How in the world did I raise such a snob?” — is a rare delight. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then find a seat where they’re screening <strong style="font-weight: 500;">“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”</strong> and buckle up for a bumpy, brilliant ride. Martin McDonagh’s small-town noir is perverse and hilarious in equal doses. Frances McDormand brings a spine of steel to her role as a single mother on a furious quest to locate the killer of her daughter, or at least to punish the local police for failing to find any suspects. Mostly strong-willed, partly kindhearted, always fuming like a blistering blast furnace, she is one woman you do not want to butt heads with.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because you need a good cry-laugh …</strong></p>
<p>Stories involving children and illness can be sugar-sweet and sentimental or manipulative sniffle-jerkers. None of that applies to Stephen Chbosky’s <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> “Wonder.”</strong></p>
<p>A kid-oriented family film, it gracefully navigates the chasm between adult drama with laughs, and young-adult fixations on mean kids, dating and popularity. As the parents of a 10-year-old boy with facial disfigurement, Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson do wonderfully nuanced work, going light on pathos and developing grown-up characters who have personalities and foibles of their own. </p>
<p>Jacob Tremblay is fine as the boy taking his first step out of home schooling as the ultimate outsider among his new private school classmates. He’s sensitive to the cruelties of his peers, but also science-prodigy smart, and a great friend to kids who don’t wall him out. </p>
<p>He’s also a total “Star Wars” nerd, which generates some funny fantasy-based appearances from a galaxy far, far away. So if you’re not all franchised out after “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” there’s that. I told you this wasn’t a shameless weepie. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because Minnesotans love local connections however inconsequential …</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">“All the Money in the World”</strong> is an elegant thriller about the gruesome 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, the 16-year-old grandson and namesake of the world’s richest man. The oil tycoon was worth $2 billion — real money in those days — but refused to pay his grandson’s ransom for five months until he could dicker the captors down to a tax-deductible $2 million.</p>
<p>For all its abduction-procedural surface, the focus of the film is the corrupting influence of money, with Christopher Plummer as the Getty, Michelle Williams as the boy’s moneyless mother and Mark Wahlberg as the former CIA agent Getty dispatched to oversee the crisis. </p>
<p>Much of Ridley Scott’s drama is fact-based — Getty truly did install a coin-operated pay phone in his English mansion for guests to use — but it omits one key fact: Getty grew up in Minneapolis, where his father conducted a successful insurance and corporate law practice. He was born there in 1892 and called it home until 1904 when his father moved his wife and son to Oklahoma to begin a new career in the booming early days of the oil business. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because you just need a change of pace …</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">“Coco” </strong>pushes Pixar films into several new territories, with a Mexican setting, Latino stars, a sprinkling of Spanish dialogue presented without subtitles, and a musical score filled with original songs.</p>
<p>Want the recipe for a delicious Guillermo del Toro sorbet? <strong style="font-weight: 500;">“The Shape of Water” </strong>puts love stories and the Creature From the Black Lagoon in a blender, adds a touch of song and dance, sex and spy thrillers, then tops it with a mesmerizing unspoken performance by Sally Hawkins that any silent screen star would envy.</p>
<p>How about a new take on a great old story? <strong style="font-weight: 500;">“Darkest Hour”</strong> returns us to the early days of World War II, when unstoppable German troops were flooding west across Europe and toward Britain. Gary Oldman is witty, humane and downright amazing as Winston Churchill, weaponizing the English language and using it to rally and unite the country. It’s superb work, a career-best performance that is transformative in every way.</p>
<p>A heaping serving of new movies will begin inundating theaters next weekend. Meanwhile, enjoy these luscious leftovers. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>It didn’t feel like this on Jan. 1, did it? </p>
<p>But 360-something days later, 2017 has turned out to be the Unexpected Year of the Woman. </p>
<p>A shocker, yes. Because remember, 2016 was supposed to be the official, glass-shattering Year of the Woman. </p>
<p>Hillary Clinton made history as the first female major-party candidate for president. Air Force Gen. Lori Robinson became the first woman to head a U.S. combatant command. Kathryn Smith was hired as the first female NFL coach. American women did the job at the Olympics, clanking home with the majority of the country’s medals. Harriet Tubman was picked to replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Three women of color - a record number - were elected to the Senate. And at long last a woman, Samantha Bee, joined the dude-dominated lineup of late-night shows. </p>
<p>Then came the backlash. </p>
<p>Even though the majority of American voters elected a woman to the White House, the electoral college - a convoluted institution created by men - gave the presidency to a man with 2.8 million fewer votes. </p>
<p>And that man, Donald Trump, made a hobby of objectifying women, insulting women and openly bragging about grabbing women. And it felt as though 2017 might be the year that the massive boulder women have been pushing uphill for centuries rolled back down. </p>
<p>But no. It turned out to be the exact opposite, and, in a way, far more powerful than any of the milestones of 2016. </p>
<p>The year began with what was believed to be the largest march the country has ever seen. On Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, women and the men who support them filled the streets, plazas and squares of Washington and cities across the country, as well as across the world. It was a breathtaking mass of humanity. On the ground in the nation’s capital, it felt as though no square foot of land was empty. From the office windows and balconies of those in power, it looked as though a tide was swallowing cities whole. </p>
<p>It was an amazing, powerful moment full of hope. But there was no unifying message, no concrete demand, no specific goal or 10-point action plan. Now we see: There didn’t have to be. </p>
<p>The women’s march ignited an energy that roiled and swelled through the rest of the year. </p>
<p>By the end of 2017, a seismic change in American culture began toppling dozens of sexual predators in the MeToo movement. A surge of female candidates ran for office and won a stunning number of elections, from city mayors to the nation’s statehouses. </p>
<p>“Women claimed big victories” with the Nov. 7 elections “in a night that marked many firsts and could signal the start of a sea change for women in politics,” wrote Governing magazine, a publication not known for breathless declarations on culture and feminism. “The sheer volume of success for women candidates was a surprise to many, mainly because they were running against incumbents who historically win re-election 90 percent of the time. But not this year. Incumbents in Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia all lost their seats to women.” </p>
<p>The milestones women achieved last year were significant, for sure. But for the most part, they were seals of approval bestowed upon women by the patriarchy. Women made progress because men at male-led institutions scooted their chairs over a bit - just a bit - and let a few women join their circle of power. </p>
<p>But what happened in 2017? That was organic and driven by women. It was a massive shift in our culture. It was 51 percent of the population demanding long-overdue change in the way we are treated. </p>
<p>In one year, our nation went from a place where 46 percent of American voters didn’t mind having a commander in chief who brags about grabbing women’s genitals to a place where a celebrity chef who allegedly gropes his female employees isn’t considered fit to be in the kitchen. </p>
<p>We are officially traveling at warp speed, my friends. </p>
<p>The Unexpected Year of the Woman was breathtaking, and the momentum can’t be stopped. </p>
<p>Watch out, 2018. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Cristin Milioti in the Netflix series “Black Mirror.”</div>
                                    </div>
<h3>Space, the frightful frontier </h3>
<p>“Star Trek” fever comes with a severe case of the chills in the most riveting offering from a new pack of “Black Mirror” episodes. In “U.S.S. Callister,” Jesse Plemons plays a lonely nerd whose fantasies about being Capt. Kirk take a dark turn when he steers his ambitions into a high-tech video game. Cristin Milioti, so terrific in “How I Met Your Mother” and “Fargo,” keeps her hot streak alive in the role of a shanghaied crew member determined to live long and prosper. </p>
<p style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;">Now streaming on Netflix </p>
<h3>Let’s get the party started </h3>
<p>Ringing in the new year with your TV as company has never been so tempting, especially if you’re dying to see if Mariah Carey can redeem herself after her disastrous appearance last time around on “Dick Clark’s Rockin’ New Year’s Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2018” (7 p.m. Sunday, KSTP, Ch. 5), a party that will also include a performance by Britney Spears. Kathy Griffin isn’t returning to her CNN perch as telegraphed by the new title “New Year’s Eve With Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen” (7 p.m. Sunday, CNN), but you’ll see plenty of familiar faces during Fox News’ “All-American New Year” with co-hosts Lisa Kennedy Montgomery and Jesse Watters (7 p.m. Sunday). Steve Harvey’s campaign to conquer the world continues with “Fox’s New Year’s Eve With Steve Harvey: Live From Times Square” with Andra Day and Maroon 5. Those who want a “classier” approach to the holiday can opt for “NY Philharmonic New Year’s Eve: Bernstein on Broadway” (8 p.m. Sunday, TPT, Ch. 2). </p>
<h3>Keep ’em coming </h3>
<p>No matter how much you might imbibe this holiday weekend, you can’t keep up with Nick and Nora Charles, the two-fisted drinking detectives in “The Thin Man.” One of cinema’s best cocktails of comedy and thrills, the 1934 film is followed by five sequels, all of which will keep you intoxicated through the night. </p>
<p style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;">7 p.m. Sunday, TCM </p>

<p>Certain comedy traditions are practiced on New Year’s Eve in the Twin Cities, including homecomings for “Baskets” case <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Louie Anderson </strong>(6:30 &amp; 9:30 p.m. Sun., Ames Center, Burnsville, <a href="https://www.ames-center.com/louie-anderson.html">$32.95-$102.95</a>) and “Daily Show” co-creator <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Lizz Winstead </strong>(2 p.m. Sat., 7:30 p.m. Sat.-Sun., Cedar Cultural Center, Mpls., <a href="https://www.thecedar.org/event/1578808-lizz-winstead-in-2017-minneapolis/">$45-$65</a>.), as well as local pioneer <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Scott Hansen</strong>’s semiannual parties with <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jeff Gerbino</strong> and<strong style="font-weight: 500;"> Pete Borchers</strong> (8 &amp; 9:30 p.m. Sat., <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3190927">Turtles Bar and Grill</a>, Shakopee, $20-$25, 1-800-838-3006; 8:30 &amp; 10:30 p.m. Sun., Maple Tavern Bar and Grill, Maple Grove, 763-425-2700). But don’t forget to offer a warm Minnesota welcome to <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Dane Cook</strong>, who just 10 years ago was one of the hottest comics in the land, selling out Madison Square Garden and hosting awards shows. Cook once performed seven hours straight, a feat he’s not likely to repeat to bring in the new year. But you never know. (9:30 p.m. Sun., Mystic Lake, $69-$149. <a href="http://www.mysticlake.com/shows-and-events/dane-cook">mysticlake.com</a>)</p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Jeremy Messersmith brought relentlessly upbeat music to Mears Park in St. Paul and other venues in free concerts in which people were invited to join in.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>There were angry rock songs, folk tunes pleading for peace, love and understanding, and hip-hop tracks steeped in escapism. For me, though, the defining song of 2017 — at least here in Minnesota — was a sweet little nonsensical opus by Jeremy Messersmith called “Everybody Gets a Kitten.” </p>
<p>First off, it’s no secret Minnesotans really love Messersmith and kittens. I mean, what a combo! </p>
<p>The bearded, bespectacled indie strummer has crafted some of this state’s catchiest and/or deeper-thinking pop and rock tunes of the past decade. And cats, oh boy, did we love them in 2017. </p>
<p>The International Cat Video Festival at CHS Field once again sold out in August. All year long, it seemed like the Star Tribune and/or City Pages were running a new blog post or photo gallery with some kind of special, needy or adorable kitty — or, jackpot, a lot of them! — which were always good for huge, viral traffic numbers. </p>
<p>Messersmith’s love song to kittens was meant to be a diversion from the headlines, as were all of the tracks on his coyly titled record <a href="http://www.startribune.com/jeremy-messersmith-invites-musicians-fans-to-sing-his-obscenely-optimistic-songs/417993433/">“11 Obscenely Optimistic Songs for Ukulele.”</a> Seeing Messersmith perform his “Obscenely Optimistic” songs under a big tree in Powderhorn Park as winter thawed in April was one of the more memorable moments in a year of covering Minnesota music.</p>
<p>So was another feline-related moment nearer the end of the year. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/punk-bands-irish-bagpipers-stage-noisy-funeral-for-minneapolis-triple-rock-on-its-final-night/459382463/">On the night the Triple Rock Social Club closed up shop last month</a>, the riotous, lo-fi punk trio Kitten Forever played a set ridiculing, roaring and raging against gender inequality, body-image issues and bone-headed patriarchy. It was the band’s way of paying tribute to the irreplaceable venue that gave them a forum to play those songs even in years that weren’t so rife with those topics.</p>
<p>Minnesota music is probably going to be a lot more like that Kitten Forever set in 2018. Here’s a little more of what defined the scene in 2017. </p>
<p>Best topic for a record this year: Life in the digital age. All wise beyond their 20-something years, Hippo Campus and Reina del Cid both riffed on living and loving in the digital age for their 2017 albums. Hippo Campus’ more atmospheric and experimental effort “Landmark” reflected on kids being absorbed with their phone screens, while RdC’s “Rerun City” concerned Netflix binges and solitary lifestyles. Ironically, though, both records were light on digital augmentation. They were recorded in real recording studios with good, old-fashioned instruments. </p>
<p>Best reason to download the St. Paul parking meter app: The Palace Theatre. St. Paul’s newly reopened theater had an air of familiarity about it <a href="http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-s-palace-theatre-feels-like-a-second-first-ave/415999134/#1">immediately upon opening in March</a>, in part because it’s run by First Avenue staff. By year’s end, it had hosted some of the best-sounding and just plain best-vibed bigger rock shows of the year. The Palace had a positive side effect, too, opening up more calendar space at First Ave’s original main room to local acts and creative dance nights (like this weekend’s double whammy with the Klituation and Bey Ball).</p>
<p>Best new venue for local talent: The Hook &amp; Ladder Theater. Although it opened in 2016, the Hook &amp; Ladder Theater <a href="http://www.startribune.com/tired-of-noisy-rock-clubs-three-new-minneapolis-listening-rooms-thrive-on-intimacy/411888756/">really hit its stride in 2017</a>. Combining its nonprofit, community-oriented, neighborhood feel with an openness (and fairness) about booking, the converted firehouse hosted everyone from young buzzers like ZuluZuluu, the Shackletons and Little Fevers to older mainstays as diverse as Flipp and Cornbread Harris, all with acoustics and aesthetics simply described as cozy.</p>
<p>Best reminders to not take our local legends for granted: Grant Hart and Sonny Knight. It’s not often you get to see a musician sing at his own farewell concert, but that’s essentially what Hüsker Dü co-leader Hart did <a href="http://www.startribune.com/all-star-cast-of-friends-surprises-grant-hart-in-a-special-salute-at-hook-ladder/432202973/">at the Hook &amp; Ladder in July</a>, an emotional night that forecast his death from cancer in September. Soul man Knight didn’t get to return to the stage before <a href="http://www.startribune.com/remembering-talented-upbeat-twin-cities-soul-singer-sonny-knight/430165693/">cancer claimed him in June</a>, but the tribute to him via Sam Cooke’s “Bring It on Home to Me” in the “Rise of the Minneapolis Sound” concert at the Fitzgerald was the year’s other gut-punching performance.</p>
<p>Best offset to all the Prince legal entanglements: His music, duh. As everyone in-the-know predicted, the messy business affairs left behind by Minnesota’s most tidily dressed music legend got even messier in 2017, making it seem like we’ll be waiting until 2047 for a proper posthumous career. Which made the continued array of musical tributes in his hometown seem all the more meaningful and vital, whether it was <a href="http://www.startribune.com/george-clinton-and-p-funk-surprise-prince-fans-at-paisley-park/420013543/">George Clinton bringing the funk at Paisley Park</a> or Dem Atlas, Proper-T and other young scenesters (who weren’t even alive when “Purple Rain” poured) <a href="http://www.startribune.com/first-ave-s-street-party-provides-a-benediction-to-prince-memorials/420181963/">paying their respects at the street party outside First Avenue in April</a>.</p>
<p>Best reason to feel good about our music scene: Charity. In the frustratingly common instances when a band’s or musician’s gear got stolen, the scene rallied with crowdfunding campaigns. When musicians or other music professionals got sick, same thing. Maybe the best example came at year’s end with news of <a href="http://www.startribune.com/mcnally-smith-students-faculty-face-uncertain-future-after-school-s-closure/464509103/">the abrupt closing of McNally Smith College of Music</a> in St. Paul. Faculty members — mostly musicians — finished off the school year for students knowing they weren’t going to be paid. Meanwhile, restaurants, arts groups and general do-gooders helped feed, house and assist students left high and dry.</p>
<p>Lastly and most importantly … </p>
<h3>Best local albums of 2017 </h3>
<p>1. The Replacements, </p>
<p>“For Sale: Live at Maxwell’s 1986” </p>
<p>Think it’s lazy or uncool to put a live recording from 31 years ago at the top of this list? So do I. But I can’t deny it was my favorite thing. No other record this year rocked this gloriously and murderously. And it really did offer a new and interesting angle on the already over-examined band, after so many bootlegs and stories suggested the ’Mats never had their live act together back in the day. </p>
<p>2. Chastity Brown, </p>
<p>“Silhouette of Sirens” </p>
<p>After a decade of honing her writing and an extra year spent remaking this album, the southern-rooted Minneapolis folk-rocker — who’s always had her molasses-thick voice going for her — pieces it all together beautifully on a record that’s mostly about personal perseverance. </p>

<p>3. Greg Grease, “Down So Long” </p>
<p>The innovative rapper/producer hits on plenty of hot topics, including racist cops and rampant poverty, but keeps a charmingly, defiantly cool head on an album loaded with subversive grooves and simmering wordplay. </p>
<p>4. Dead Man Winter, “Furnace” </p>
<p>There’s plenty of blood on the tracks on Trampled by Turtles frontman Dave Simonett’s divorce record, but there’s also a lot of hopeful harmonies and elegant instrumentation that keeps it from ever feeling as cold as the band name suggests. </p>
<p>5. Mary Bue, “The Majesty of Beasts” </p>
<p>The ’90s-flavored Duluth expat covers a lot of musical and lyrical ground on this taut five-song EP, none more flooring than “Petty Misdemeanor,” about her own experience with sexual assault and the men who (used to?) get away with it. </p>
<p>6. Romantica, “Shadowlands” </p>
<p>Ben Kyle touches on religion, family, music, alcohol and other fun staples of his Irish roots on his enduring Americana rock band’s first album in nine years, as musically lush as it is poetically rich. </p>

<p>7. Lady Midnight &amp; Afrokeys, </p>
<p>“Parables of Neptune” </p>
<p>There’s a growing wave of local women singers carving out a cool cross-section between the worlds of neo-soul, hip-hop and electronic music. This was the one record in that mix that was as innovative as it was infectious. </p>
<p>8. Actual Wolf, “Faded Days” </p>
<p>Alt-twanger Eric Pollard and his MVP sidemen ambitiously and unabashedly channel heroes like Neil Young and Tom Petty on a charmingly breezy, liberated-sounding LP for Red House Records that recalls the ’70s as plainly as the vinyl it was issued on. </p>
<p>9. Reina del Cid, “Rerun City” </p>
<p>Former teen wunderkind Rachelle Cordova comes into her own with imaginative storytelling and coolly timeless, casually soulful folk-rock, highlighted by the slow-building centerpiece “Beverly.” </p>
<p>10. Stnnng, “Veterans of Pleasure” </p>
<p>Even on what’s supposedly its last record — another one produced by the legendary Steve Albini — this stormy Minneapolis noise-rock outfit makes most other loud-guitar bands sound like “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Walker Art Center’s <a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/series/out-there-2018">“Out There”</a> series began 30 years ago as a way to get arts lovers out of the house during the dreary, nothing-to-do first month of the year. These days, there are more reasons to venture out in January, but “Out There’s” concerns haven’t changed.</p>
<p>“Where is theater going in the future? How can the form be played with/distorted/expanded? How can it speak to our time and the next?” asks Walker performing arts curator <a href="http://www.startribune.com/philip-bither-getting-out-there-with-the-ultimate-insider/287950581/">Philip Bither</a>, listing some of the questions in the back of his mind as he considers possibilities for “Out There,” a series he says he envisions as “a chance to cleanse the palate in the new year, after lots of ‘Nutcrackers’ and ‘Christmas Carols.’ ”</p>
<p>One challenge of always looking for the next thing is that audiences catch up. The nipple slip that might have shocked audiences in 1987 is barely Tweet-able now. And walk-outs, once common during “Out There” performances, have become less frequent as audiences figured out what to expect from the series — and as artists have stopped thinking of inaccessibility as a badge of honor. That moving-target-of-innovation is why the Walker has become more involved in commissioning works for “Out There,” such as this season’s “Real Magic” and “Quizoola!” from Forced Entertainment. And it’s why Bither has had to cast a wider net; work in the series has become more international over the years. </p>
<p>As Bither scours the world, what is he looking for? It may be easier to say what he’s not looking for: No “well-made plays,” meaning traditional works with beginnings, middles and ends. No new pieces from established darlings of the indie art world such as Laurie Anderson or theater-maker Robert Lepage, although the latter will appear at the Walker in his <a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/robert-lepage-887">“887” in April</a>). Those folks are too big for the kind of surprises “Out There” craves.</p>
<p>“It’s a chance for us — and for audiences — to take different kinds of chances, to see pieces that are entertaining but, at times, unlike anything else you’ve ever seen,” says Bither. </p>
<p>Despite all that innovation, some tropes have emerged over the years, so we’ve added labels to help identify “Out There” standbys that loom large in this year’s shows: nudity; politics; playing around with gender; inter-disciplinary (or mixed-media) works; investigating the relationship between artists and audiences, and grappling with the question “What is theater?” </p>

<p>“It’s a dense work, but very playful and very funny,” says Bither of this work by the Cuban troupe Teatro El Público, in which the late Fidel Castro is depicted as a monkey. “There is a critique of the lack of freedom that’s pretty irreverent and that has lots of built-in questions.” One Walker fave over the years has been theatrical troupes that boldly re-imagine classic works (Bither says the half of the audience that didn’t walk out still comes up to him to rave about a Belgian take on “King Lear” in 2001). Teatro El Publico fits squarely in that tradition with its loose take on the ancient Greek “Antigone,” which pits human will against the gods. The piece will be performed in Spanish, with English subtitles. <span>(8 p.m. Jan. 4-6) <br>
</span>NUDITY, INTERDISCIPLINARY, POLITICAL</p>
<p><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/dana-michel-mercurial-george">‘Mercurial George’</a></p>
<p>This solo work by Montreal-based choreographer/performer Dana Michel is the most provocative of this year’s offerings, says Bither, who confesses “I was having some trouble with it” when he first saw the piece. “Mercurial George” blurs the lines between audience and performer in a way Bither says is meant to make theatergoers uncomfortable about the character they’re watching. She is, of course, played by an actor but there are times when that actor seems to be experiencing genuine distress in a way that made Bither “question whether the piece was more disturbing or more fascinating.” Spoiler alert: He landed on the latter. <span>(8 p.m. Jan. 11-13) </span>NUDITY, INTERDISCIPLINARY, POLITICAL, GENDER ROLES, ARTIST/AUDIENCE</p>
<p><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/600-highwaymen-the-fever">‘The Fever’</a></p>
<p>This interactive piece by the New York-based troupe 600 Highwaymen is designed to give audiences all the feels. “To me, it felt very much like a gentle instruction around how we could be a better society,” says Bither of the timely work, which will put theatergoers right on stage with 600 Highwaymen. The artists have said the idea is not just to illustrate how much we all depend on each other, but to live it. <span>(8 p.m. Jan. 18-20) </span>POLITICS, ARTIST/AUDIENCE, GENDER ROLES, WHAT IS THEATER</p>
<p><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/forced-entertainment-real-magic">‘Real Magic’</a></p>
<p>“Real Magic,” a Walker commission, is the first of two works this year from the experimental, six-person company Forced Entertainment, which could be thought of as an English equivalent of the legendary New York-based Wooster Group. Mixing elements that call to mind Samuel Beckett with dance and a malfunctioning game show, “Real Magic” speaks to the effort to connect. <span>(8 p.m. Jan. 25-26) </span>ARTIST/AUDIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY, WHAT IS THEATER</p>
<p><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/forced-entertainment-quizoola">Quizoola!</a></p>
<p>“Quizoola!” is both a marathon and a sprint, a six-hour performance at the Soap Factory in southeast Minneapolis that audiences are invited to pop in and out of. Part quiz show and part shindig (there will be booze), “Quizoola!” is followed by a free party untl midnight to celebrate the 30th anniversary of “Out There.” <span>(4 p.m. Jan. 27) </span>ARTIST/AUDIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY, WHAT IS THEATER<br>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Starting point guard Jeff Teague sustained a knee injury late in Wednesday’s Timberwolves victory over Denver. If it’s serious, backup Tyus Jones will be in the spotlight.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Rand</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/randball/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/28120127/teague.jpg">Jeff Teague arrived in Minnesota with a three-year, $57 million contract and a reputation for being a solid point guard who could score and distribute while potentially being a defensive liability. He’s been pretty much as advertised through the Wolves’ first 35 games, and while they owe their 22-13 record more to a handful of other players Teague has been a meaningful contributor.</p>
<p>He’s also been put in two unenviable positions of comparison. </p>
<p>One is to departed point guard Ricky Rubio, a fan favorite even as he polarized the Timberwolves’ rooting base by being quite good at everything except one very important thing: shooting the basketball. It was that deficiency that led coach/basketball boss Tom Thibodeau to move on from Rubio in an offseason unloading trade to the Jazz and to bring in Teague — a much better shooter but a much less flashy passer, among other things. </p>
<p>The second comparison is to backup point guard Tyus Jones — an improving third-year player and astute floor general who also happens to hold a trump card of being a Twin Cities native. </p>
<p>There are Wolves fans who can’t stop wondering what this team would have looked like if Rubio was still here with the improved supporting cast Thibodeau built in the offseason. And there are Wolves fans who have watched Jones and Teague this year and wondered if Jones should be playing more minutes than he has — or even more minutes than Teague. </p>
<p>They will get what they asked for on that second front, albeit under the worst circumstances of a Teague knee injury sustained late in Wednesday’s dramatic overtime win over Denver. Teague has a sprained knee <a href="http://www.startribune.com/timberwolves-jeff-teague-has-sprained-left-knee-no-structural-damage/467002483/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and will miss an unspecified amount of time</a>.</p>
<p>The question now becomes: Is Jones ready for an expanded role? </p>
<p>A quick look at the numbers would seem to suggest he is. </p>
<p>By several measures, Jones has outplayed Teague this season — albeit in playing about half the minutes. In terms of offensive and defensive rating — a measure of points produced or allowed per 100 possessions — Jones has been superior. He’s posted a 125 offensive rating and a 109 defensive rating ( <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per Basketball Reference</a>), while Teague’s offensive rating is 108 compared to a defensive rating of 112.</p>
<p>Jones has a higher true shooting percentage (.598 compared to .549 for Teague), in large part because Jones has actually been better than Teague from three-point range (41.9 percent to 37.5). Teague has a higher assist rate, but Jones turns the ball over less and produces more rebounds and steals. </p>
<p>Most importantly, when Teague was sidelined for a few games earlier this year, Jones showed he could handle an increased workload. In his three starts, Jones played at least 38 minutes each game and the Wolves went 2-1. Jones was a combined plus-45 in those three games (meaning the Wolves outscored opponents by 45 points when he was on the floor). </p>
<p>That said, there’s a big difference between playing well as a fill-in starter for a few games plus performing well off the bench in other games … and being the main guy almost every night like Teague has been. Jones has had the benefit of playing against other teams’ backups in some cases, and playing fewer minutes can hide a player’s weaknesses. Does Jones have the size, strength and quickness to match up with top point guards in the league? It’s a legitimate question. </p>
<p>Jones, though, does have the sort of skill set that would seem to mesh well with the other Wolves starters. The way he gets the Wolves organized is reminiscent, in fact, of Rubio’s skill set. </p>
<p>Jones has played 93 minutes this year in a lineup with the other four Wolves regular starters — Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson and Andrew Wiggins — and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018/lineups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Wolves have outscored opponents by an average of 10.9 points per 100 possessions during those minutes</a>.</p>
<p>It seems a safe bet to assume Jones will add to that total quite a bit Thursday night when the Wolves face Milwaukee in the second night of back-to-back games. </p>
<p>Beyond that, we’ll have to wait and see how he responds and how long Teague is out. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>ST. PAUL, Minn. — An attorney for victims for clergy sex abuse said Thursday that a judge has ordered all sides back to mediation in the years-long bankruptcy case of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, but he said the ruling will quicken the process of getting payments to victims. </p>
<p>The judge denied both the archdiocese’s reorganization plan and a competing plan submitted by a creditors’ committee before ordering all sides back into negotiations, St. Paul attorney Jeff Anderson said. The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015, as it faced an onslaught of new abuse allegations. </p>
<p>Anderson said the judge’s decision means “there will be a speedier resolution” than either plan could have offered. A spokesman for the archdiocese did not immediately reply to messages for comment. </p>
<p>The plan from the archdiocese included a fund of more than $155 million for abuse victims who filed claims in bankruptcy court. The bulk of that money comes from insurance payments. A plan by the survivors’ committee calls for the archdiocese to increase its contributions to the victims’ fund to at least $80 million. </p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of the abuse victims voted in favor for a plan submitted by the creditors’ committee in May. </p>
<p>Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Kressel declined to include parishes and other church properties among assets in the archdiocese’s bankruptcy. The committee representing abuse victims wanted to consolidate the assets of various entities in the archdiocese, which would have meant more money to pay victims’ claims. </p>

<p>The foreclosure rate in Minnesota is now at the lowest level in more than a decade, and far below the national average. </p>
<p>At the end of September, just 0.2 percent of all Minnesota homeowners with a mortgage lost their homes to foreclosure, according to CoreLogic, which tracks mortgage delinquencies at several intervals. That rate was down from 0.3 percent last year and was only third of the national average. </p>
<p>At the same time, far fewer homeowners are having trouble staying current on their mortgage payments. In Minnesota, 2.9 percent of all homeowners were 30 or more days late on their payment compared with 3.1 percent last year. </p>

<p></p>
<p>“We’re encouraged to see another year of flat or declining delinquency rates for homeowners across Minnesota,” said Julie Gugin, director of the Minnesota Homeownership Center. “It shows people are in the right homes for their families and their wallets.” </p>
<p>During the height of the foreclosure crisis, the organization’s counselors were overwhelmed by demand from homeowners who needed help avoiding foreclosure, Gugin said. Today, the need has shifted to providing unbiased information and hands-on financial coaching for low-income families that want to buy a home. </p>
<p>“They want to make choices based on solid and factual information,” Gugin said. “Rent prices are on the rise and homeownership is a valuable asset-building alternate for some families.” </p>
<p>Gugin said that while declining foreclosures is clearly a positive sign, underlying problems linger. Namely, the recession and subsequent economic recovery only broadened the homeownership gap in Minnesota. There are more low-income families than before that are unable to own a home. </p>
<p>“Our goal is to ensure that homeownership’s benefits are fairly available and sustainable to everyone, no matter their race or where they live,” she said. “Next year — and even 10 years from now — we want the delinquency rate to stay low, and with a closed homeownership gap. Individuals and families, communities and our state would be better off as a result.” </p>
<p>Foreclosure rates across the country are also falling. Nationwide, the foreclosure rate fell slightly from 0.8 percent to 0.6 percent, and the 30-day plus delinquency rate fell from 5.2 percent last year to 5.0 percent in September. There was a slight increase, however, in the number of homeowners who were 30 to 59 days late on their payments, mostly because of hurricane-related troubles in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hey, y’all. Just a quick blog today. </p>
<p>While Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said Wednesday he was hopeful winger Nino Niederreiter would practice Thursday at Xcel Energy Center, the forward was not on the ice for the training session. </p>
<p>“From what I gather, he’s skating tomorrow,” Boudreau said after practice Thursday. “So I mean, he’s out this weekend. But hopefully at some point next week, we’d get him back.” </p>
<p>Niederreiter left the Dec. 22 game at the Florida Panthers in the first period with a left foot or ankle injury and has missed two games for the Wild. With the back-to-back with the Nashville Predators starting 7 p.m. Friday at Xcel Energy Center before the rematch 7 p.m. Saturday at Nashville, Niederreiter might not return until the Jan. 2 home game also against Florida. </p>
<p>Also, Zach Parise wasn’t at practice since he is likely to play tonight for the Iowa Wild on his rehab assignment. Will be his first game this season. It’s at 7 p.m. in Des Moines against the Rockford IceHogs. You can listen to the game <a href="https://kxno.iheart.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, I believe.</p>
<p>“If I’m not watching it, I guarantee you I’ll be getting updates every 10 minutes,” Boudreau said. </p>
<p>Here were the lines at practice, btw. Nothing out of the ordinary. Also, looked like Ryan Suter and Jared Spurgeon were reunited as a D-pair, as were Jonas Brodin and Matt Dumba. Nate Prosser, Mike Reilly and Gustav Olofsson rotated in the third pair. </p>

<p><span>MILWAUKEE </span>– Timberwolves guard Jeff Teague, injured in Wednesday’s game against Denver, has a sprained MCL in his left knee and will miss an unspecified period of time, beginning with Thursday night’s game against the Bucks.</p>
<p>Teague had an MRI on the knee Thursday and there was no structural damage, a league source confirmed. </p>
<p>Teague had to leave Wednesday’s overtime victory at Target Center following a scrum for a loose ball after a jump ball with 13.4 seconds left in regulation. </p>
<p>Tyus Jones appears ready to take over for Teague. </p>
<p>“As always, it’s whatever the team needs me to do,’’ Jones said after Wednesday’s game win. “I’m hoping Jeff is all right. You never want to see anyone go out with an injury. But it’s the next man up. I’m ready to help this team in any way.’’ </p>
<p>Jones started three straight games in November when Teague was out because of a sore Achilles. The Wolves went 2-1 and Jones averaged 12.3 points and 6.7 assists while shooting 54.1 percent. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A developer proposed building a 17-story, luxury residential tower near the Galleria in Edina, the latest attempt to build a highrise in the affluent suburb for an expected surge of older wealthy people in coming years. </p>
<p>The complex, located on Hazelton Road close to France Avenue, would offer 170 units ranging from one-bedroom apartments to three-bedroom penthouses as well as two-story townhouses along the Promenade greenway. </p>
<p>The developer behind the proposal is Lund Real Estate Partners, a Twin Cities-based real estate company led by Tom Lund. He was vice president of development for The Opus Group from 1997 through 2013, then co-founded Illinois-headquartered Harbor Bay Real Estate Advisors and Lund Real Estate Partners. </p>
<p>Lund submitted a sketch plan dated Dec. 20 to Edina city planners, who say the project is expected to be discussed at the Jan. 10 planning commission meeting. ESG Architects of Minneapolis designed the project. </p>
<p>“As we watch the community transformation happening before us, we have also been struck by the lack of upscale multifamily alternatives for existing and future residents of Edina,” Lund wrote in the proposal. “As recent empty nesters, we have each witnessed our friends and neighbors leave Edina for perhaps a condo at The Carlyle in downtown Minneapolis or an apartment at The Lakes on Calhoun. Not always by choice.” </p>
<p>The complex would have an enclosed 255-stall parking garage, a fitness and yoga studio, clubroom, outdoor deck and bike storage and lounge for maintenance. </p>
<p>Lund’s team was attracted to the site due to its walkability where residents could easily travel on foot to stores and other amenities. </p>
<p>Currently, the site is home to the 12,000-square-foot Guitar Center building, which would need to be demolished to make way for the more than 300,000 square-foot high-rise. According to Hennepin County property records, the property is owned by apartment development company StuartCo. </p>
<p>StuartCo. leadership wasn’t immediately available to comment Thursday. Guitar Center representatives also couldn’t be reached. </p>
<p>The apartment tower would join a list of high-density, housing projects that have been recently proposed in Edina. This past summer, developer EG Capital <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-two-towers-and-bike-bridge-project-in-edina-has-changed-to-one-tower-and-a-bridge/439942063/">submitted plans</a> for a residential development further down France Avenue at Gallagher Drive. A couple of months ago, city leaders <a href="http://www.startribune.com/edina-rejects-height-change-for-residential-towers-project/451460133/">rejected</a> a plan by developer Ryan Cos. to build two condo towers further north on the other side of France Avenue.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Bloomington-based Doran Companies and KM2 Development of Minneapolis <a href="http://www.startribune.com/doran-will-build-housing-at-site-of-former-best-buy-southdale-store/463488583/">started demolishing</a> the empty Best Buy store at the Southdale Shopping Center to make way for a five-story, 185-unit apartment building.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">News conference will be held at 2 p.m. by attorney for some of the victims</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By David Chanen</h4>
<p>A federal bankruptcy judge has rejected the two compensation plans presented in court to settle clergy abuse claims against the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. </p>
<p>Jeff Anderson, an attorney for several of the abuse victims, will hold a news conference at 2 p.m. to explain Judge Robert Kressel’s ruling and what will happen next in the case. </p>
<p>In his decision Thursday, Kressel ordered the archdiocese, insurance companies, parishes, creditors’ committee and the sexual abuse survivors, back to mediation. </p>
<p>In August, Kressel heard from more than 20 attorneys about the plans, which aim to put an end to more than two years of legal wrangling. </p>
<p>The plan by the committee representing abuse survivors calls for tougher settlements with insurance companies and far greater contributions from the archdiocese. But it faced objections from the archdiocese, parishes and insurance companies for being too far reaching and essentially “liquidating” the archdiocese. </p>
<p>The archdiocese’s plan, which includes $156 million for the more than 400 people who have filed claims of clergy sex abuse, drew opposition from victims’ attorneys who have said that it is inadequate and lets insurers and parishes off the hook. </p>
<p>Kressel did not rule on either plan in August, but he expressed concern about the length of time that would transpire before the survivors would receive compensation. At least two survivors with claims already have passed away, he said. </p>
<p>The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in January 2015, citing the number of clergy abuse claims made possible through the Minnesota Child Victims Act, which opened a window for older abuse cases to be heard in civil court. That window closed in 2016. </p>
<p>The Twin Cities case is unusual among the 15 bankrupt dioceses and archdioceses in the country, as the judge allowed the two competing compensation plans to be heard in court, said Anderson. </p>
<p>The archdiocese plan calls for tapping about $120 million in insurance settlements, plus about $30 million from the archdiocese and from some parishes, to create a fund for sex abuse victims who filed claims in bankruptcy court. It includes a court order to prevent them from filing future lawsuits against the parishes and insurers involved. </p>
<p>The competing plan filed by the survivors’ committee calls for the archdiocese to increase its own contributions to the victims’ fund from the current $15 million to at least $80 million. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A Twin Cities photographer on Thursday accused Twins third baseman Miguel Sano of grabbing her and trying to kiss her after an autograph session at a local mall in 2015, saying on Twitter that “no, he didn’t rape me, but he sure did assault me.” </p>
<p>Betsy Bissen, who occasionally photographed Twins games on a freelance basis for the Twins Daily fan website, <a href="https://twitter.com/BitzyBetsy/status/946407707606740992">posted on Twitter her description </a>of the October 2015 incident, which she said left her body “sore all over from having to fight off this athlete that thought he was entitled to take advantage of me against my will.”</p>
<p>The post on the incident quickly gained viral attention on social media, the latest instance of the “#MeToo” movement in which women have come forward to disclose unwanted advances and assaults by men. A few hours after Bissen’s tweet, Sano issued a statement denying that it happened, and Major League Baseball announced it is investigating the allegations. </p>
<p>The Twins, Bissen tweeted, knew nothing of the incident; while she shared the story with close friends and family members, she said, she waited until now to come forward in order “to feel free of this burden I’ve carried with me since 2015.” </p>
<p>Sano, who made the American League All-Star team in July but missed nearly all of the season’s final six weeks with a stress reaction in his left shin that required surgery in November, has spent much of December at the team’s Fort Myers, Fla., training complex. TMZ Sports published a statement it said was from Sano that read, “I unequivocally deny the allegation made against me today — it never happened. I have the utmost respect for women, especially those working in professional sports, and I deeply sympathize with anyone who has experienced sexual harassment. There is no place for it in our society.” </p>
<p>The Twins issued this statement: “Today the Minnesota Twins were made aware of allegations involving Miguel Sano at an off-site appearance during the 2015 season. The Twins, along with Major League Baseball, take these allegations very seriously. Until more information is gathered, the Twins will have no further comment.” </p>
<p>The incident, Bissen confirmed, occurred after an autograph-signing appearance by Sano at Fan HQ, a sports memorabilia and apparel shop at Ridgedale Center in Minnetonka, on the next-to-last day of the 2015 regular season. After the event, Sano grabbed Bissen, who had been taking photos of Sano interacting with fans, by the wrist and insisted that she accompany him as he shopped, Bissen wrote. “I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I just went along,” Bissen said in her post. </p>
<p>After a half-hour, Sano decided to leave with his agent, and went out a back door, Bissen said, then said he needed to use a restroom. When Bissen pointed at the door, she wrote, “the athlete took that as a signal that I wanted him to grab me and try to take me back through that door.” Bissen described a struggle with Sano, who was grasping her wrist, as he “leaned down and tried to kiss me, more than once. Every time he did, I said no and kept pulling back. … When I said no, it should have been the end of it. He should have respected that and stopped. Instead, he hurt me and kept going.” </p>
<p>The assault, Bissen wrote, continued for 10 minutes, even when she screamed for help, before Sano finally gave up. </p>
<p>Rob Plummer, Sano’s agent at the time, did not respond to Star Tribune calls seeking comment. But he told ESPN that while he was with Sano that day, he was unaware of any assault. </p>
<p>“I was outside next to the car, waiting for him to come out on the other side of the loading bay dock, so I don’t know what happened inside,” Plummer, who was fired by Sano in January 2016, told ESPN. “I didn’t see or hear anything.” </p>
<p>Bissen’s post was retweeted more than 1,400 times within three hours of posting, and received hundreds of replies — including a couple from Twins players. Former Twin Trevor Plouffe, Sano’s teammate at the time, tweeted “I’m so sorry about this. I understand why you didn’t, but I wish you would have come to me.” </p>
<p>And current Twins pitcher Trevor May tweeted, “I’m sorry Betsy.” </p>
<p>Under MLB’s collective bargaining agreement with the players, the Commissioner’s office, not individual teams, has the authority to investigate instances of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse and impose penalties. </p>
<p>Bissen’s post also described harassment by “the first-base coach [who was] hitting on me almost every game I was at.” The Twins’ first base coach at the time was Butch Davis, whose contract was not renewed after the 2016 season. Bissen wrote that she could ignore his comments, which “didn’t bother me until he tried to ask for my phone number. A married man, around 20 years older than me. I didn’t oblige.” </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Latest on President Donald Trump’s statements related to North Korea (all times local): </p>
<p>2:55 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is reminding the world that he’s long warned about the dangers posed by North Korea’s nuclear program. </p>
<p>Trump tweeted a compilation video Thursday that includes edited footage of an interview he did with NBC’s “Meet the Press” nearly two decades ago. </p>
<p>In the interview, Trump said he’d be willing to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea if negotiating “like crazy” didn’t work. And he describes the country as “sort of wacko.” </p>
<p>Trump tweets that he’s “been saying it for a long, long time. #NoKo.” </p>
<p>Trump earlier Thursday singled out China following reports that Chinese ships transferred oil to North Korean vessels at sea in violation of U.N. sanctions over the North’s nuclear weapons program. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry said Wednesday China has strictly enforced trade restrictions. </p>
<h4>___ </h4>
<p>12:10 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is attacking China following reports that Chinese ships improperly transferred oil to North Korean vessels at sea, saying there “will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!” </p>
<p>Trump said on Twitter Thursday that China had been “Caught RED HANDED,” adding he was “very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea.” </p>
<p>Trump did not provide additional details. </p>
<p>The South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo cited unidentified officials this week as saying Chinese ships transferred oil to North Korean vessels some 30 times since October. </p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry has defended its enforcement of U.N. sanctions. A ministry spokeswoman said Wednesday she had no information about the latest report, but said China has strictly enforced trade restrictions. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>WATERBURY, Conn. — Police have decided not to cite a woman who hit and critically injured a former Connecticut lawmaker and prominent businessman with her car. </p>
<p>The Republican-American reports authorities found Birgit Clemente’s vision may have been obscured by bushes and a glare from the sun when she struck former Republican state Rep. Selim Noujaim on Oct. 30 in Waterbury. </p>
<p>Noujaim had been placing signs for his nephew, who was running for office. He suffered a head injury and was treated at and released from a hospital. </p>
<p>Police gave Noujaim a verbal warning for hazardous entrance onto a highway. </p>
<p>Noujaim previously told the newspaper he could not remember the crash. </p>
<p>Noujaim’s attorney and Clemente can’t be reached for comment. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>MAHWAH, N.J. — A town facing federal and state lawsuits over ordinances alleged to discriminate against Orthodox Jews is poised to take a vote that could reshape the dispute. </p>
<p>Mahwah’s town council was expected to vote Thursday night on reversing a ban on out-of-state residents using the town’s parks. The ban was prompted by some town residents’ complaints about overcrowding at the parks and their use by Orthodox Jewish families coming from towns across the nearby New York border. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the council reversed part of an ordinance that effectively banned eruvs, pieces of plastic piping attached to utility poles that serve as boundary markers delineating areas where Orthodox Jews can carry items and perform some activities during their Sabbath. </p>
<p>The lawsuits allege those measures are an attempt to keep Orthodox Jews from New York’s Rockland County out of Mahwah. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed by the state in October seeks to block the ordinances and to secure the return of more than $3.4 million in state grants the town has received from the state Department of Environmental Protection. It characterized the town’s actions as resembling “1950s-era white flight suburbanites” who sought to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The state contends Mahwah violated New Jersey’s Green Acres Act by banning out-of-state residents from its parks, and it wrote that land acquired under the law cannot be restricted on the basis of religion or residency. </p>
<p>Mahwah council president Robert Hermansen this week denied anti-Semitism played any role in the decisions. He has said the council simply followed the principle that “In Mahwah, Mahwah residents come first.” </p>
<p>Town officials don’t have to look far (or far back) to find a similar dispute. Tenafly, a borough just north of the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey and New York City, was forced to pay a Jewish group more than $300,000 in legal fees and allow the group to keep its eruv up after a six-year legal battle. </p>

<p>A 40-year term is the sentence for a man who fatally beat a 2-year-old boy early this year, ending at least two months of physical abuse he inflicted on his girlfriend’s child in the Crystal residence they shared. </p>
<p>Quran J. Mitchell, 22, was sentenced Thursday in Hennepin County District Court after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in connection with <a href="http://www.startribune.com/authorities-id-crystal-2-year-old-allegedly-beaten-to-death-by-mom-s-boyfriend/413838763/">the death of Joshua Isaiah Lockhart Jr. on Feb. 12</a>. A first-degree murder count was dismissed as part of the plea deal reached last month.</p>
<p>An autopsy disclosed that the boy had head and eye injuries and bruises on his left arm, shoulder, ear, cheek and forehead. </p>
<p>With credit for time in jail since his arrest, Mitchell will serve the first 26 or so years in prison and the balance on supervised release. </p>
<p>Mitchell was on probation at the time he beat Joshua in the house in 3400 block of Adair Avenue where he rented space. Less than 30 days before Joshua’s death, Mitchell had been sentenced to 90 days in the workhouse on a misdemeanor domestic assault conviction, but that incarceration was set aside by Hennepin County Judge Bruce Peterson. </p>
<p>Mitchell also has a misdemeanor disorderly conduct conviction stemming from his involvement in a fight in November 2015. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By TERRY TANG — Associated Press</h4>
<p>PHOENIX — A U.S. judge has permanently blocked an ethnic studies ban in Arizona public schools that dismantled a popular Mexican-American studies program, dealing a final blow to a law that he found to be racially motivated. </p>
<p>Following a seven-year court battle, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima issued a final judgment Wednesday that prohibits Arizona education officials from enforcing the 2010 law, which stirred up more allegations of racial discrimination by a state that passed a landmark crackdown on immigration the same year. </p>
<p>Tashima had previously ruled that racism and political gain were behind the ban’s creation, findings that he reiterated in this week’s decision. </p>
<p>Because the law “was enacted and enforced, not for a legitimate educational purpose, but for an invidious discriminatory racial purpose, and a politically partisan purpose … (the law) cannot be enforced,” he wrote. </p>
<p>Attorneys for the state have denied that racial discrimination played a part in the law. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office, which defended education officials in the case, said it may appeal the ruling. </p>
<p>“We will consult with the superintendent and see how she would like to proceed,” spokesman Ryan Anderson said. “Additionally, we have an obligation to evaluate the likelihood of success on appeal for the individual findings.” </p>
<p>Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas and the state Board of Education did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Thursday. </p>
<p>The law banned courses appearing to promote resentment toward a race or class of people or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of treating people as individuals. </p>
<p>Lawmakers passed it after Tucson Unified School District began offering classes in 1998 focused on Mexican-American history, literature and art. </p>
<p>Steven Reiss, an attorney for Tucson students who sued over the law, was pleased by the ruling. </p>
<p>“That should make it clear to everyone in the state: This law is not only invalid and cannot be enforced, it makes it clear that the Tucson Unified School District is absolutely free to readopt the Mexican-American studies program,” Reiss said. </p>
<p>The Tucson district ceased the classes in 2012 to avoid the threat of losing 10 percent of their state funding as a penalty. District officials did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Thursday. </p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Sally Ann Gonzales of Tucson praised the ruling. </p>
<p>“Attacking the Mexican-American studies program sends the wrong message to Arizona’s students and denies the state’s rich and diverse history,” Gonzales said in a statement. “It is important for Arizona to teach the history of minority communities of the past and present day.” </p>
<p>During a July trial over the lawsuit, Tom Horne, a former state attorney general and state superintendent, defended the law he drafted. He testified that he was troubled by what he described as radical instructors teaching students to be disruptive but insisted he targeted all ethnic studies programs equally. </p>
<p>Education officials can move to dissolve the injunction once it expires in seven years, the judge said. </p>

<p>Tom Baden, the head of Minnesota Information Technology Services — which builds and maintains the state’s IT infrastructure, projects and services — announced Thursday that he is retiring. </p>
<p>His last day as IT services commissioner and the state’s chief information officer is Feb. 2. His departure comes as the IT organization grapples with complaints about the new Minnesota Licensing and Registration System, which <a href="http://www.startribune.com/gov-mark-dayton-other-officials-apologize-for-minnesota-licensing-problems/457814753/#1">has caused delays </a>for Minnesotans trying to get vehicle titles, renew their tabs or transfer license plates.</p>
<p>Baden, who has worked in state government for 36 years, said in a statement that he is retiring now to recover from unforeseen complications stemming from some health issues. </p>
<p>“In the coming days, Governor Dayton will begin an active search for a new State Chief Information Officer,” he said in a statement. “It has been the honor of a lifetime leading MNIT and watching us grow as an organization.” </p>
<p>A spokeswoman with the department said Baden was not available for further comment Thursday. </p>
<p>Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Baden as the state’s IT services commissioner and chief information officer in 2015. He oversees a staff of about 2,200. </p>
<p>Baden previously led the IT team for the Department of Human Services, and helped handle the rocky rollout of the MNsure health insurance exchange. He has worked with various state departments over the years, including the Department of Employment and Economic Development. </p>
<p>His biography on state’s website says he is a seasoned singer-guitarist, who likens IT to the nuances of a rock performance, where everyone must be in sync. </p>
<p>“It’s our job to ensure that the ‘performers’ and ‘instruments’ in our environment are playing in unison — helping to provide the essential services that Minnesotans rely upon,” it states. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — Sen. Al Franken is meeting with supporters and friends in Minnesota before he officially resigns. </p>
<p>The Democrat planned to attend an event Thursday night in Minneapolis to thank supporters and friends after his eight years in the Senate. Media outlets were expected to be allowed to attend part of the event. </p>
<p>Franken announced his plans to resign earlier this month amid a storm of sexual misconduct allegations. He’ll officially step down on Tuesday. His successor, current Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, is set to be sworn in on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The former Saturday Night Live comedian first won his Senate seat in 2009, after a lengthy recount. He officially beat Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes. </p>
<p>But support from many of his fellow Senate Democrats collapsed after the sexual misconduct allegations. Franken disputed or denied many of the accounts. </p>

Freeman, a Minnesota prosecutor who publicly criticized agents investigating the death of an Australian woman fatally shot by a police officer said Monday, Dec. 18, 2017, that he is sorry and was wrong to discuss the agency’s work in a public setting.

<p>A decision on whether Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor should be charged in the shooting death of Justine Damond will be made sometime in 2018, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement Thursday. </p>
<p>Freeman reversed several previous statements he had made that he would make a charging decision on the case before the end of the year. But he said Thursday that the investigation is not done. </p>
<p>“We are getting more information and evidence and additional investigation must be completed. As I have mentioned before, the investigation and review of the case will not be rushed. It is more important to get it right than to get it done quickly,” Freeman said. </p>
<p>He refused to take questions from the media. </p>
<p>Noor shot and killed Damond on July 15, after the Australia native called 911 twice to report a possible sexual assault outside of her south Minneapolis home then went into the back alley. Noor and his partner, Matthew Harrity, responded to the call. When she approached the squad, Noor, from the passenger’s seat, shot across Harrity in the driver’s seat, striking Damond in the lower abdomen. </p>

<p>In one of his last speeches to supporters before he resigns, U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., promised to continue fighting for the causes he has championed over the past decade. </p>
<p>“Here’s my promise to you,” he told about 300 supporters, family members and friends gathered Thursday night in northeast Minneapolis. “I may be leaving the Senate, but I’m not giving up my voice. We still have a lot of work to do together on issues ranging from net neutrality to climate change.” </p>
<p>It was Franken’s first public appearance in Minnesota since he was accused of sexual harassment, followed by his decision to resign from the Senate. He spent the evening thanking those who have supported him over the years and amid the turmoil of recent weeks. </p>
<p>“One of the hardest things about leaving this job will be not getting to work alongside you every day, but I cannot wait to see what you do next,” he said, his voice cracking as he thanked his staff. </p>
<p>Campaign and office staff, state officials and politicians sipped drinks and snacked at the Machine Shop event space, where many lamented his resignation. </p>
<p>Franken, 66, <a href="">plans to step down Jan. 2,</a> a decision he made after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment. When the first allegations emerged in November, he apologized and offered to undergo a Senate ethics investigation. But as the number of similar stories mounted, many of his colleagues in the Senate urged him to resign, and he decided to heed their call.</p>

<p>Christy Dickinson, who worked on Franken’s campaigns, was one of several people at the event who said she wishes he would have stayed in office and gone through the investigation. “It leaves a bit of ambiguity,” she said, and she feels he is leaving without due process. </p>
<h3>Survey shows support </h3>
<p>“It will be hard to find another person that will continue that work in the same way,” Dickinson said. She said Franken spent a lot of time getting to know the issues and the people who often don’t have a voice in Washington, D.C., including immigrants and members of Minnesota’s American Indian communities. She said he has operated in the mold of his political idol, the late Sen. Paul Wellstone — who got a few shout-outs in Franken’s speech Thursday. </p>
<p>The event came the same day as Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling <a href="">published a survey </a>showing that Franken remains popular in his home state, and 50 percent of Minnesota voters do not think he should resign.</p>
<p>Despite the allegations and political winds against him, a majority of the 671 Minnesota voters interviewed on Dec. 26 and 27 approved of Franken’s job performance, the survey found. It was commissioned by the Strategic Consulting Group, which promotes Democratic causes and campaigns; 40 percent of people who participated in the survey identified as Democrats. </p>
<p>The former “Saturday Night Live” writer and radio host was elected to the Senate in 2008. </p>
<p>“People knew that I was passionate about the issues” when he first ran, Franken said, but they didn’t know if he was serious about the work. “All these years later I am deeply proud of all the work I’ve been able to do on Minnesotans’ behalf.” </p>
<p>In Congress, he worked to move past his comedy background and focused on issues like protecting survivors of sexual assault and net neutrality, which aims to prevent internet service providers from charging people more to access certain websites or applications. </p>
<p>Franken helped make net neutrality a critical issue and has taken on President Donald Trump’s administration more than almost any other senator, said Eliot Seide, the recently retired union director of AFSCME Council 5. </p>
<p>“I hope he continues to play a role in public policy and speaking out,” Seide said. </p>
<p>Since making his resignation announcement three weeks ago, Franken has continued to vote, attend hearings and make speeches in the Senate. </p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tina Smith will be sworn in Jan. 3 and take over his seat. Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Smith to fill the post, and she has said she plans to run in the 2018 special election to keep the seat. </p>
<p>Franken has campaigned hard for other DFL candidates during his years in office, said his state director, Alana Petersen. And in keeping with that work, he offered words of support for his successor. </p>
<p>“We still have terrific candidates worthy of the kind of incredible support I have received,” he told the crowd. “Starting with my friend Tina Smith.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>This was supposed to be a quiet year for Lesley Nneka Arimah. Yes, her first book was coming out, but it was a collection of short stories, and who pays attention to short stories? It’s novels that get the buzz, and she was still writing hers. </p>
<p>“In the back of my mind I was thinking, oh, things will happen with the novel, right?” Arimah said. Instead, “everything happened this year. It’s been quite the whirlwind, and I think it’s finally sinking in.” </p>
<p>Published in April, “What It Means When a Man Falls From the Sky” <a href="http://www.startribune.com/debut-book-catapults-minnesota-author-to-literary-stardom/419723893/"> lit up the world of books like a shooting star. </a>It garnered rave reviews nationally and internationally and won prizes and honors, including the $50,000 Kirkus Fiction Prize. It is unusual for a first book to get this kind of attention, and nearly unheard of for a collection of stories.</p>
<p>“Lesley is a great writer,” said Lisa Lucas, executive director of the National Book Foundation, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-writer-lesley-nneka-arimah-named-one-of-national-book-foundation-s-five-under-35/447660253/">which honored Arimah with its 5 Under 35 award.</a> “She produced a collection of stories that are really hard to pin down. They’re funny and intelligent and fierce in their own way, and they’re unexpected. I love that I picked up that book and I had no idea what I was picking up. And I left a bit in awe of her craft.”</p>
<p>Arimah is at the forefront of a growing number of young authors, primarily immigrants and writers of color — in the Twin Cities, as well as across the country — who are writing some of the most original and interesting fiction and poetry being published today. </p>
<p>For all of these reasons, Twin Cities writer Lesley Nneka Arimah is the Star Tribune’s Artist of the Year for 2017. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/review-what-it-means-when-a-man-falls-from-the-sky-by-lesley-nneka-arimah/417709403/">Her stories defy easy description.</a> They range from realistic to magical realism to speculative fiction. They are funny and tragic — sometimes at the same time, in the same sentence. Most are set in Nigeria, but a few take place in Minneapolis. In these stories, published in the New Yorker, Granta, Catapult and elsewhere, mathematicians no longer work with numbers but work to subtract sadness from people’s psyches; a dead mother walks out of a photograph; women create babies out of wrapping paper, fabric and human hair and watch them come to life.</p>
<p>While surreal, the stories also seem completely plausible, grounded as they are in Arimah’s unwavering understanding of human nature. </p>
<p>“What they all have is this intense feelingful but unsentimental grasp on relationships between people,” said Rebecca Saletan, editorial director of Riverhead Books and Arimah’s editor. “Especially between family members — between fathers and daughters, between siblings, between mothers and daughters.” </p>
<p>She first encountered Arimah’s work when she read “Who Will Greet You at Home” in the New Yorker, the story about babies made of human hair. </p>
<p>“I was so taken by this extraordinary mixture of the intense psychological reality of this mother and daughter, and at the same time this fantastical element that was built into the story with complete confidence,” Saletan said. “I got in touch with her agent.” </p>
<p>She was struck by how all of the stories in Arimah’s collection seemed “fresh and alive.” Riverhead signed her to a two-book contract. </p>
<h3><strong>Deep thoughts, funky glasses</strong></h3>
<p>In person, Arimah is tall, funny and warm, with a whole collection of funky eyeglasses (more than 30 pairs) and colorful jumpsuits that she sews herself and sometimes posts photos of on Twitter, her second home. She laughs easily, a throaty chuckle. But she is deeply thoughtful and very serious about her work; her stories explore themes of exclusion, loneliness, displacement and climate change. </p>
<p>“Most of my private time is spent worrying about the state of the world,” she said. </p>
<p>Arimah, 34, was born in the United Kingdom to Nigerian parents, the middle of five children. (She is sandwiched between two sets of twins.) Her family moved around a lot — her father was an engineer in the oil industry — but Nigeria was always home base until the family settled in Louisiana, when Arimah was 13. </p>
<p>“Loneliness was something I dealt with a lot as a child, especially after we moved to the United States, feeling unmoored in what was then to me a very strange culture and trying to find my place within that,” Arimah told actor LeVar Burton on his weekly podcast, <a href="http://www.levarburtonpodcast.com/">“LeVar Burton Reads.”</a></p>
<p>The “Reading Rainbow” and “Star Trek: The Next Generation” star features one short story per episode, but he was so taken by Arimah’s work that in August he broke form and spent an entire show interviewing her. </p>
<p>When you’re an outsider, Arimah told him, “You learn to be an observer. And as somebody who eventually moved into documenting the human experience, being an observer is a useful tool.” </p>
<p>Arimah came north in 2007 to study in the MFA program at Minnesota State University, Mankato; she was attracted to that program partly because of its emphasis on teaching. </p>
<p>She had been warned that Minnesota was cold, so she stepped off the plane on a sweltering July day swathed in a heavy sweater. (A sweater that did not do the job once winter arrived.) </p>
<p>After graduating in 2010, she stayed in Minnesota, partly because things started happening. In 2012 she was accepted into the Loft mentorship program, working with St. Paul writer Mona Susan Power. The writers group that grew out of that sustained her for several years. “We all liked and trusted each other, which was important,” she said. “It was a wonderful experience, and it felt very essential to helping me put the collection together.” </p>

<h3><strong>New wave of vibrant voices</strong></h3>
<p>Arimah’s first published story appeared in January 2014 in PANK Magazine, a literary journal founded by Roxane Gay that cultivates innovative voices. Over the next two years, she published more stories, won the Commonwealth Prize, got an agent and landed a whole slew of grants — from the Minnesota State Arts Board, Intermedia Arts, the Jerome Foundation and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Minnesota, a state that once was best known for white male writers such as Robert Bly, Sinclair Lewis and F. Scott Fitzgerald, was developing a strong community of female writers as well as writers of color. Some — Arimah, Marlon James, Danez Smith, Sun Yung Shin and Bao Phi, for instance — were getting national and international attention, and others — Su Hwang, Donte Collins, Anika Fajardo — were well on their way. </p>
<p>“I don’t think necessarily that more writers of color are writing,” Arimah said. “Or that more writers of color are writing at a certain level. I think that it’s just a situation where society at large is in a position to where maybe we’re finally ready to hear them, finally ready to listen. I think it’s just a moment in time where there’s been an acknowledgment that there are more stories out there — acknowledgment by the mainstream, I mean. </p>
<p><em>“We’ve</em> always known that we were there.”</p>
<p>This year she was chosen as one of the National Book Foundation’s 5 Under 35 — all five honorees are women, and three of them are women of color. Each was selected by a different author chosen by the foundation. Arimah was picked by Chris Bachelder, a white male writer who was born in Minneapolis but grew up in the South. </p>
<p>“We didn’t guide him to her, or give him a book. We gave them nothing,” executive director Lucas said. “Chris is a funny, wild writer himself. He saw something in her work that really spoke to him.” The fact that he loved Arimah’s work “says a lot about who we are as readers and what kind of work can speak to another person. </p>
<p>“I think part of the reason it’s so interesting to read writers of color is that we haven’t heard them as much,” Lucas said. “People of color have always had the same desire to write our life experiences to the page as anyone else. But I think we’re seeing so much more nurturing of those voices.” </p>
<p>Editor Saletan agreed, noting that Riverhead has long been particularly diverse. </p>
<p>“What feels really fresh and new and unexpected are these other voices coming from other parts of the culture,” she said. “They’re exciting to read. I read as an editor, but reading as an editor is first and foremost reading as a reader. And it’s what gets me jazzed.” </p>
<h3><strong>Novel in the works</strong></h3>
<p>In November when the Kirkus Prize was to be announced, Arimah was in the Netherlands, speaking at the Crossing Border music and literary festival. The shortlist was mighty: Her collection was up against books by former National Book Award winners Alice McDermott and Jesmyn Ward, as well as books by Mohsin Hamid, Hari Kunzru and Carmen Maria Machado. </p>
<p>“I knew the award was being announced that day, but I had no concept of myself winning it,” Arimah said. “So I woke up to get a glass of water, and checked Twitter, of course, because I have to check Twitter at least once an hour, and there it was.” She chuckled and shook her head. “I was actually rooting for someone else.” </p>
<p>Novelist Meg Wolitzer, who served on the selection committee, praised Arimah’s work in an e-mail to the Star Tribune. </p>
<p>“I was really struck by the way these exceptionally strong, well-made stories do so many things, sometimes in succession, and sometimes all at once,” Wolitzer wrote. “Arimah uses her significant authority to take the reader all over the place: into and out of girlhood, families, violence, magic. She can be fantastical, devastating, dystopian, wild, but she’s always precise, and she’s always exciting to read.” </p>
<p>Arimah is winding up a semester teaching in the MFA program at the University of Minnesota, and next semester she will teach in Warren Wilson College’s low-residency MFA program in North Carolina. She is also serving as a mentor at the Loft for a group of fiction writers. She continues to write short stories, including one commissioned recently by the British magazine Stylist. </p>
<p>The editors requested a Christmas story from her, which Arimah found briefly baffling. “I thought, ‘Have they <em><span>read</span> </em>my stuff?’ ” she said. The story, called “The Gift,” “is not entirely full of Christmas cheer.”</p>
<p>But while all this goes on, all the noise and awards, the speaking, the traveling, the teaching, the tweeting, there in the background — or, actually, in the foreground — is The Novel, which Arimah has been working on for several years. She will not reveal the title, nor the plot. Talking about it “lets the air out of the balloon,” she said. </p>
<p>But it is there, and it is inching toward completion, one rewrite at a time. “The most recent change was something I realized I had been fighting for a while, which was that the person who I thought was the main character was not the main character,” she said. “So I rewrote the book from a different character’s perspective, and it was a better book for it.” </p>
<p>She is determined to get it done, and done right. But short stories will always be there. </p>
<p>“When I was in grad school I wrote both,” she said. “I am equally vested in both genres.” </p>
<p>She thought a moment, and added, “I would say short stories might just edge out novels. I just love the form.” With her book, “I wanted to cover a lot of ground, and a short-story collection allowed me to do that. I could sink into a world for 20 pages and pay homage to all the genres that shaped me, and then sink into another world for 20 pages. I love the freedom to jump from genre to genre.” </p>
<p>Novel or stories, her editor at Riverhead is happy with either. “I can only tell you that I’m 35 years on in my career,” Saletan said, “and though I absolutely delight in taking on new writers, I don’t take them on that often. </p>
<p>“It’s rare that one of them pops the way she does.” </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.xcelenergycenter.com/events/detail/lorde">Local debut of Lorde, Xcel Energy Center, March 23</a></h3>
<p>About time. The angsty New Zealand electropop singer of “Royals” fame skipped the Twin Cities while touring behind her breakthrough debut album, even though she headlined Lollapalooza in nearby Chicago and crisscrossed America a couple times. She’s taking her bittersweet time getting here behind her successful follow-up record, too, but the wait could be worth it. Titled “Melodrama,” the Grammy-nominated sophomore collection shows greater musical depth and richer vocal abilities — the kind of growth that most of us experience in our lives from the ages of 16 to 20. </p>

<h3><a href="https://hennepintheatretrust.org/release/national-tour-of-hamilton-coming-to-minneapolis-in-the-2018-2019-broadway-season-at-the-orpheum-theatre/">“Hamilton,” </a>probably late summer, Orpheum Theatre</h3>
<p>When theater genius Lin-Manuel Miranda read Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton, he had one clarifying question: Who are the contemporaries with the swagger, courage and flair to take on an empire the way Washington, Hamilton and Jefferson did? Miranda looked to Biggie Smalls, Tupac and other rappers for inspiration. The result, marrying American revolution with revolutionary art, has become a force of nature that has engaged young people in history like nothing in recent memory. The nation had long yearned for a musical to tell its revolutionary story the way “Les Misérables” honors French history. The same goes for Minnesotans unable to catch “Hamilton” in New York or elsewhere. </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt__kig8PVU">“Isle of Dogs,” opening March 23</a></h3>
<p>A new Wes Anderson film is always good news. And it’s a special degree of cool when his films feature stop-motion animation, an added bonus to his delightfully quirky work that started with “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou” and fully bloomed in “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” His idiosyncratic vision returns with “Isle of Dogs,” a futuristic story about a 12-year-old Japanese boy exploring a huge garbage dump/island where his cherished canine has been quarantined following an outbreak of the dog flu. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt__kig8PVU">The trailer looks extra interesting</a>, with the visual design resembling a grungy animé world rather than his usual fastidiously crafted aesthetic. The outstanding vocal cast includes Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston and Yoko Ono. Yes, that Yoko Ono.</p>

<h3><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/abc-new-shows/news/shows/roseanne-returns-to-abc">“Roseanne” returns, March 27, ABC</a></h3>
<p>The final season for “Game of Thrones” would be the most anticipated event of the TV season — but rumor has it those last six episodes won’t unspool until 2019. That means the top of 2018’s must-see list is ruled by an entirely different kind of fire-breathing dragon. There’s always a chance that new episodes of “Roseanne” will be inspired more by 1997’s bizarre final season than the 1980s blue-collar roots that made it one of the most grounded TV sitcoms of all time. But the fact that Roseanne Barr is asking viewers to ignore the show’s original ending and has reunited key players, including Tony winner Laurie Metcalf, has me cackling in anticipation. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.latteda.org/assassins">“Assassins” at Theater Latté Da, Feb. 7-March 18</a></h3>
<p>I recently mailed Stephen Sondheim a note, thanking him for teaching me something about myself with this soaring shocker of a musical, in which a bunch of presidential assassins and would-be assassins try to explain their misguided actions, in songs that fit the eras when they lived (Carpenters-esque soft rock for Squeaky Fromme, a Sousa-like march for a failed attempt on Teddy Roosevelt). Alas, the note was returned because of an incomplete address. Although I missed out on communicating with the man known in the theater world as “God,” the show is a bold, difficult and moving work that has lots to say about times of political turmoil through the ages. </p>

<h3><a href="https://content.thespco.org/events/venues/turf-club/">St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Turf Club, Jan. 24 and March 15</a></h3>
<p>The guy behind the counter at the Electric Fetus was confused. I wanted to buy tickets to hear the SPCO perform … where? His surprise was a good reminder that this chamber orchestra is taking risks. Among them: putting an oboe on the stage of my favorite rock club. This season, after a successful first try, the SPCO is playing three concerts in that gritty, great-sounding room. The Jan. 24 show starts with Mozart but quickly veers into (where else?) more adventurous territory. </p>

<p>Before her debut album was released in 2006, little-known newcomer Taylor Swift ambled onstage at the Myth nightclub in Maplewood with an acoustic guitar and performed Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.” I was smitten. I’ve paid attention ever since. She’s smart, creative and resourceful. She understands how to connect with fans more effectively than any other big star of today. Even though I don’t always dig her albums, I’m counting on Swift to figure out how to stage a successful concert at the problematic-for-concerts U.S. Bank Stadium. </p>

<h3>Opening of the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/dome-construction-begins-planetarium-new-bell-museum">MacMillan Planetarium, midsummer</a></h3>
<p>Since the Minneapolis Planetarium closed in 2002, a generation of Minnesotans has grown up without a place to stargaze on cloudy days, to look deep into the universe and dream, as future astronaut Pinky Nelson did in the 1960s. That will change when the new Bell Museum of Natural History opens on the U’s St. Paul campus. The museum itself (and its life-size woolly mammoth) sounds plenty oohs-worthy, but what’s truly out of this world is this state-of-the-art planetarium, with two 4K laser projectors and seating for 120 under a 16-meter aluminum dome. The grand opening will feature an original production showing how Minnesota was shaped over the course of 4 billion years. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.liquidmusicseries.org/tu-dance-bon-iver/">TU Dance and Bon Iver, Palace Theatre, April 19-21</a></h3>
<p>TU Dance inspires bated anticipation with every performance, so hopes are off the charts for the company’s collaboration with Wisconsin singer-songwriter Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Vernon and TU choreographer Uri Sands are sensitive, visionary artists with enormous appetites for risk-taking. Their sold-out, three-night engagement, commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Liquid Music Series, is bound to result in a sumptuous new work. Let’s hope it also marks the beginning of many more dancer-musician partnerships. </p>

<h3>Minnesota Orchestra celebrates Leonard Bernstein <a href="http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/">, February-June</a></h3>
<p>August marks 100 years since the birth of Leonard Bernstein, arguably America’s most prodigiously talented classical musician. While Bernstein’s reputation as a conductor is solidly established, his music is still patchily appreciated. So I’m especially looking forward to a pair of Minnesota Orchestra concerts featuring some of Bernstein’s less familiar compositions. The intense, Oscar-nominated score he wrote for Elia Kazan’s 1954 movie <a href="http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/buy/tickets/browse-calendar/eventdetail/944/-/american-voices-copland-and-bernstein">“On the Waterfront” is the highlight of a spring subscription concert </a>(May 3-5). Then comes <a href="http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/buy/tickets/browse-calendar/eventdetail/953/-/andrew-litton-and-the-minnesota-chorale-bernstein-and-walton">the sparky ballet “Fancy Free” and “Chichester Psalms,”</a> an iconoclastic religious work originally written for cathedral performance (June 1-2). The orchestra also will perform his “West Side Story” score with a screening of the film Feb. 15-17.</p>

<h3><a href="https://childrenstheatre.org/plays/2017-2018-season/the-wiz">“The Wiz” at Children’s Theatre, Jan. 23-March 18</a></h3>
<p>I can’t wait to introduce my 5-year-old to the infectious songs from “The Wiz” — aka the Super Soul Musical “Wonderful Wizard of Oz” — thanks to a kid-friendly co-presentation by Penumbra and Children’s Theatre companies. This highly promising production hews to the Broadway original that swept the 1975 Tony Awards — not the legendarily bad 1978 movie starring Diana Ross and a young Michael Jackson. The Minneapolis show boasts a stellar cast, too, including “American Idol” alum Paris Bennett and Minnesota musical all-stars Greta Oglesby and Dennis Spears. </p>

<h3><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/allen-ruppersberg-intellectual-property-19682">“Allen Ruppersberg: Intellectual Property” at Walker Art Center, March 17-July 29</a></h3>
<p>Although I’m an art critic who thinks about visual things all the time, I’m a sucker for well-wrought words-turned-art. That’s why I’m looking forward to this major retrospective. Best known for his late 1960s creations, conceptual artist Ruppersberg is invested in the American vernacular — what we broadly call “pop culture” — using it to riff and run in his text-based works. Using text and color only, he renders familiar slogans strange. If he had been born much later, he might be one of today’s meme-making internet artists. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Alicia Eler, visual art critic </p>
<h3><a href="http://marysharratt.com/main/?page_id=678">“Ecstasy” by Mary Sharratt, April 10</a></h3>
<p>Minnesota native Sharratt has built a career writing meticulously researched, fascinating historical novels about strong women forgotten by time. “Illuminations” (2012) brought to life 12th-century German mystic Hildegard von Bingen. “The Dark Lady’s Mask” (2016) might have solved the question of the identity of Shakespeare’s muse: poet Aemilia Bassano Lanier. “Ecstasy” takes up the cause of Alma Schindler, a composer in turn-of-the-century Vienna. Men fall at her feet — painter Gustav Klimt, composer Gustav Mahler, Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius, poet Franz Werfel — but Alma dreams of becoming a composer. She falls in love with Mahler, who demands she give up music if they are to marry. This book comes out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and I, for one, cannot wait. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>I was happy to read that health experts now encourage us to relax on the calorie front at holiday time. We don’t, in fact, gain an average of 5 pounds between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day. It’s more like 2 pounds, which one could argue equals a respectable day at the Minnesota State Fair. </p>
<p>And no one’s sounding alarm bells about that. </p>
<p>The memo to ease up comes at a good time, as I find myself drawn to any opportunity to become a first-rate slacker. </p>
<p>I very much like the sound of a “failure résumé,” for example. The newish concept suggests that we can only embrace our complete selves if we do an honest accounting of our professional lows alongside our noteworthy accomplishments. </p>
<p>There was the time, for example, when the “royal we” were fired from Dairy Queen because “we” never could make that little squiggly thing at the top of the ice cream cone. </p>
<p>Thank goodness journalism would have me. </p>
<p>I’m growing more appreciative, too, of those brave souls posting to social media about what life really looks like: </p>
<p>Cakes that don’t rise. Mental health issues that ebb and flow and ebb. </p>
<p>Tantruming children. </p>
<p>And of books, such as Megan McArdle’s “The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well Is the Key to Success.” And “Mistakes Were Made — But Not by Me,” by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson. And Tim Harford’s “Adapt: Why Success Always Starts With Failure.” </p>
<p>Frankly, it’s all such a relief! Trying to keep up appearances is exhausting. </p>
<p>My 2018 New Year’s resolutions, thus, are threefold: </p>
<p>1. Fail more. </p>
<p>2. Apologize less. </p>
<p>3. And embrace good-enough. </p>
<p>The most exciting prospect of failing more is that we get to leap headlong into all sorts of things we were afraid to try as kids, sometimes due to others’ dismissiveness but, more likely, due to unfortunate and negative self-talk. </p>
<p>Want to sing? Play broomball? Do stand-up? Want to do singing stand-up while playing broomball? In 2018, no one will stop you. Flail and fail away. It’s the point. </p>
<p>As talent manager Susie tells stand-up wannabe Midge in Amazon’s hit, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” you have to learn to bomb, like every great comedian in history. </p>
<p>My shortlist does not include stand-up, but it does include gardening (surrounded as I am by newsroom Master Gardeners), singing in public, swimming in a lake. </p>
<p>Oh, and downloading the Lyft app. </p>
<p>Aside from embracing failure, I also will apologize less. Ever see two women at a bathroom door, one exiting and one entering? They both apologize for the fact that the door opened. This is not occurring 2 feet away at the men’s room. </p>
<p>Now, please note. I did not say I’d stop apologizing. I’m just going to dole out my regrets more appropriately. If I misspell your name in my column? Not just an apology, but a published correction. </p>
<p>My car runs into the back of yours? Really sorry and so grateful that no one was hurt. </p>
<p>Apologize to my server when he got the order wrong? I’m going to stop doing that. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m going to embrace good-enough, also known as the 80 percent rule. Running slowly is still running. Your dog doesn’t know that you’re singing off-key. (Well, my dog doesn’t know.) </p>
<p>Burning the roast doesn’t take away the loving attempt that was cooked into it to please a crowd, and there’s always pizza in the freezer. </p>
<p>These efforts, in fact, are not signs of failure. They’re signs of life — human life which includes inevitable moments of humility, whether we hide them or post them for all of the “social” world to see. </p>
<p>In her bestselling book, “Option B,” Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg writes about a Princeton professor named Johannes Haushofer who posted his <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf">failure résumé</a> in response to a challenge issued by scientist Melanie I. Stefan. Haushofer’s “CV of Failures” includes the headings “Degree programs I did not get into,” “Academic positions and fellowships I did not get,” and “Awards and scholarships I did not get.”</p>
<p>Haushofer joked that this résumé, crafted to “provide some perspective,” received “way more attention than my entire body of academic work.” </p>
<p>I’m guessing that it was a relief to all who saw it. In 2018, may all of our résumés be lovingly flawed. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Should put-upon worker tell the boss what’s up?</h2>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">.</div>
                                    </div>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> I work on a small creative team. Infrequently, but genuinely, the boss comes by and compliments us on the creativity of recent work or a high-profile project. One team member contributes very little, but hops in to speak for the team with comments such as, “It did look great!” and, “You are welcome!” It is hard to get a word in without seeming needy for recognition. Do I say something to this person? Do I tell the boss who actually did the work? Or, do I rest my head on my pillow knowing I did a nice job?</p>
<p><strong><span>Low road:</span></strong><span> </span>Jump in with, “Just think how much greater it would look if you actually did what was assigned to you!”</p>
<p><strong><span>High road:</span></strong><span> </span>A boss who delivers infrequent but genuine appreciation is a savvy and skilled boss, one who understands that constantly cheery feedback becomes like background noise; workers stop hearing it. Conversely, no positive feedback — ever — creates unhappy employees who will quit at the earliest opportunity. I have a hunch your co-worker knows he or she is falling short, which is the reason for such ebullient, and overcompensating, reactions to praise.</p>
<p>You could express frustration to your boss, but that might compromise your own good standing. Bosses don’t like complainers. </p>
<p>Still, it’s normal and healthy to want to be appreciated. Going forward, make sure to create individual expectations and deadlines for each player, which makes it harder to silently drop balls. And keep a folder of your finest work, including letters from happy clients. </p>
<p>At year’s end, advocate for yourself. Have coffee with your boss, review your proudest moments and work together to create even grander goals for the new year. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">If you want character, go outside.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>The high today is predicted to be around 0, which means there is no temperature at all. We ran out. Come back tomorrow. </p>
<p>Optimists are saying the thermometer might reach 1, but that’s not all that impressive, either. It’s like someone found an extra degree in the storage room, blew off the dust and propped it up. </p>
<p>Whatever the temp ends up being today, make sure you get outside and build some character. That’s what our cold weather does, you know. Of course, the only part of your character that’s built is the part that can accept low temperatures, which isn’t really a test of character at all. </p>
<p>Let’s imagine Eliot Ness, going up against Al Capone in the days when bootlegger money corrupted many a cop: </p>
<p>Ness: “I need policemen whose character is unimpeachable. You there. Where did you grow up?” </p>
<p>Sgt. Huedere: “Arizona, sir.” </p>
<p>Ness: “Sorry. I need men whose character was built by exposure to insanely cold weather.” </p>
<p>Huedere: “In the summer, the temperature was over 100 for weeks at a time. I watched my dog burst into flames one day. My pappy said we’d stick it out because it made us strong, God-fearing people who could take anything.” </p>
<p>Ness: “Anything? What if Capone threatened to put snow down your pants?” </p>
<p>Huedere (sheepishly): “I’d do anything he said, I guess.” </p>
<p>Ness: “Get off my squad. You there, Svenson. Where did you grow up?” </p>
<p>Svenson: “Mortification, Minnesota. Got down to absolute zero from October through April, and it made me the man I am today. I have so much incredible character. Also six prosthetic toes.” </p>
<p>Ness: “What if Capone offered you fancy ivory false toes, like Rockefellers have?” </p>
<p>Svenson: “I’d say no, because I am the sort of strong person who doesn’t wear a hat in 5-below weather because it musses my hair.” </p>
<p>Ness: “You’re just what we need.” </p>
<p>Character is more than the ability to endure without complaint because your lips have frozen solid, but we like to think it makes us tough. I guess it’s one of those “whatever doesn’t kill me makes me stronger” things — which itself is ridiculous. “Gosh, Hank, you’re lifting twice the weights you hoisted last week!” “Yep! Had double pneumonia.” </p>
<p>To sum up; if you want character, go outside. If you want strength, stay inside, which does not kill you. For extra-strong character, go out to get the mail in your shorts. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">There’s a bubbly for every taste and budget.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Until now, having New Year’s Eve fall on a Sunday was a pox on a procrastinator’s holiday. At the very least, it meant an excursion to Wisconsin to pick up the evening’s sparkling libations. Or — heaven forbid — doing without. </p>
<p>Not anymore. Since last summer, Minnesotans have been afforded an option most of the nation already enjoyed: Sunday spirits sales. </p>
<p>The better news: The choices in the beverage category associated with this particular holiday have mushroomed exponentially in recent years, with superb offerings galore from countless locales at friendly prices. It’s no longer necessary to shell out $50 or more for Champagne — not that there’s anything remotely wrong with that — nor does going the cheapo route have to result in headache-inducing swill. </p>
<p>The options are many and varied. (I’m sticking with the white and pink ones, although Lambruscos and other red bubbles are worth considering.) </p>
<h3><strong>Cava</strong></h3>
<p>It’s fitting that the name of these Spanish sparkling delights contains the letter “v.” After all, the wines are laced with vim, vigor, vitality and vivaciousness. </p>
<p>This is basically Champagne for (craft) beer budgets. The wines generally cost $15 to $25 but are made with the exact same practices (called, conveniently enough, <span>le méthode champenoise</span>) as spendier bubblies from Spain’s northern neighbor. They generally have the same racy, mouthwatering acidity as Champagnes, but not so much of the bready, nutty notes.</p>
<p>The primary grapes are macabeo (called viura in Rioja), xarel-lo and parellada and are most prominently produced in Catalonia, in an area called Penedès. </p>
<p>For years, bargain-basement Freixenet and Codorníu dominated shelf space, but now more complex offerings abound. Look for Mas Fi, Segura Viudas, Mont-Marcal, Avinyó, Juvé y Camps, Montsarra or Pere Mata. </p>
<h3><strong>Prosecco</strong></h3>
<p>It’s hardly surprising that Proseccos have rocketed in popularity in recent years, given their easy-drinking, slightly sweet nature. The residual sugar in most of them provides the perfect sparkling beverage for American consumers who — due in part to being raised on soda pop — tend to “talk dry and drink sweet.” </p>
<p>For years, these wines were made primarily with a grape called Prosecco, but the vintners changed that to Glera so they could get government certification around a region called Prosecco. Hey, it’s Italy. </p>
<p>The most popular production methods, Charmat or Martinotti, have the secondary fermentation (which spawns the bubbles) taking place in tanks rather than bottles, a decidedly less expensive approach. Good bottles usually can be had for less than $20, very good ones for a little more. </p>
<p>In the past year, I have thoroughly enjoyed Proseccos from Adami (a wide range of offerings), Alberto Nani, Barocco, Cavicchioli 1928, Desiderio Jeio, Fantinel, Mionetto (if “Valdobbiadene” is also on the label) and San Martino. </p>
<h3><strong>Franciacorta</strong></h3>
<p>Virtually unknown and unavailable in these parts a few years ago, bubble-icious bottles from Italy’s Lombardy region are well worth seeking out. Made with chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot blanc using <span>le méthode champenoise</span>, these wines still tend to land in the $20 to $30 range.</p>
<p>Tasty choices include Barone Pizzini, Corte Aura, Ronco Callini and Vini La Valle. </p>
<h3><strong>Cremant</strong></h3>
<p>Living up to their translation, Crémants are sparkling wines that almost invariably are “creamier” than Champagnes and come from other parts of France. They might be made in traditional methods but generally are not. The grapes used also can vary. Plenty of good ones fall in the $15 to $30 range. </p>
<p>They emanate, not surprisingly, from some of France’s finest wine regions, including Alsace (seek out Lucien Albrecht, Pierre Sparr, Zinck), Burgundy (André Delorme, Amiot Guy et Fils, Louis Bouillot, Simonnet-Febvre) and the Loire (Charles Bove, Langlois-Chateau, Gérard Bertrand, Joseph Mellot, L’Éperonnière). </p>
<h3><strong>Back in the U.S.A.</strong></h3>
<p>Fabulous strides have been made at larger and smaller sparkling-wine houses in California and Oregon, but the tariffs tend to reach or even surpass the typical prices of Champagnes. </p>
<p>Time to look to … New Mexico, where a winery called Gruet produces surpassingly delicious bubbles using traditional techniques and grapes (pinot noir and chardonnay, grown in the high desert around 4,200 feet in elevation). </p>
<p>I’m a longtime advocate of their blanc de noirs, blanc de blancs and brut iterations, and earlier this month was wowed and dazzled by my first encounter with the brut rosé. You’ll usually get change for your $20 bill when purchasing any of these gems. </p>
<p>But consider buying two of these — or any of the choices above. Plus some fresh OJ or white-peach nectar to make mimosas or Bellinis and turn New Year’s Day into a festive occasion, as well. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>When they choose work at Ten Thousand Things Theater Company, they talk about “stretchy” plays that leave room for artists to interpret them and for audiences to find themselves in them. </p>
<p>It’s a word that speaks to many hallmarks of TTT, including a boldness of vision, taking the lead in gender-imaginative casting and embracing diversity. Which is why absolutely no one was surprised when the company’s founding artistic director, Michelle Hensley, used an <a href="http://www.startribune.com/theater-leader-s-call-for-the-field-to-appoint-women-leaders-continues-to-resonate/448248293/">Ivey Awards acceptance speech</a> last fall to emphasize the importance of boldness and diversity.</p>
<p>Honored for her lifetime achievement, the soon-to-retire Hensley spoke about the need for many points of view. On a more practical tip, she noted that, with TTT and several other Twin Cities theaters searching for their next leaders, “most of those positions need to be filled by women, and the majority of those women need to be women of color.” </p>
<p>There are a lot of powerful words in that sentence — and in the rest of her speech — but the most powerful one is the least equivocal: “Need.” </p>
<p>Hensley didn’t say it would be great if women could get their numbers up over the 30 percent that currently represents female leadership in American theater. She didn’t say, “Wouldn’t it be swell if half the new leaders we hired were female, just like the population?” She said the figure <span>must</span> be more than half, and not only because everyone would feel better about themselves if more women and people of color were in the room. Theater, she says, absolutely needs those voices if it wants to remain vital.</p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">The Intermedia Arts building.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>For 44 years, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/what-would-be-lost-if-intermedia-closes-twin-cities-artists-reflect/451893793/">Intermedia Arts</a> in south Minneapolis has served as a home for boundary-pushers of all kinds — dance, visual art, theater, music, film/video or spoken word — to sharpen their skills and raise their voices. The venue also doubled as a sanctuary for vulnerable populations, including immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>So it was a shock when Intermedia announced in September that it was laying off its entire staff and suspending operations in the face of a financial crisis. </p>
<p>There’s a cautionary tale here for other nonprofits that make up the most vibrant yet fragile cohort in Minnesota’s cultural scene — those with budgets between $500,000 and $2 million. With a pre-crisis annual budget of $1.4 million, Intermedia failed to cut spending even as it experienced a precipitous drop-off in grants and other contributed income. Simply put, it <a href="http://www.startribune.com/financial-analysis-shows-steep-debt-revenue-dropoff-for-intermedia-arts/450014853/">ran out of money</a>.</p>
<p>The experience should have a sobering effect on other organizations that may have forgotten the lessons of the 2008 financial crash, which caused pain for arts groups large and small. </p>
<p>They could take a cue from the flagship Guthrie Theater, which managed to balance its budget last year despite a drop in ticket sales. “Fiscal responsibility is one of our core values,” Guthrie artistic director Joseph Haj told the Star Tribune recently. “Our role as a not-for-profit is to make as much excellent art as we can within the financial rigors of what the budget can allow.” </p>
<p>Intermedia’s future is cloudy. The center’s board of directors said in December that they were putting its property in the hot Lyn-Lake area up for sale, which should fetch $1 million or more. Meanwhile they’re looking for community partners to take over some of its programs. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Tales from Lake Wobegon often feature a wry twist, but there was nothing amusing about the shocking turn that threatens to permanently stain Garrison Keillor’s reputation. </p>
<p>Minnesota Public Radio <a href="http://www.startribune.com/garrison-keillor-fired-for-improper-behavior/460802703/">severed ties with its biggest name</a> in November, saying the legendary broadcaster allegedly had exhibited “inappropriate behavior” toward a co-worker.</p>
<p>Nationally, the story took a back seat to the firing of longtime “Today” show host Matt Lauer, revealed the same day the architect of “A Prairie Home Companion” disclosed that he had been dropped. Accusations had already been aimed at other media figures including Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey, creating such an impact that Time magazine named the “Silence Breakers” as its Persons of the Year. </p>
<p>But locally, it was Keillor who dominated coffee-shop conversation: Was he just another bigwig creep who got what he deserved or was he railroaded in a sloppy investigation? </p>
<p>In a series of e-mails to the Star Tribune, Keillor ardently defended himself, providing some details behind the allegations. MPR? Not so much. Until more is known about the accusations, this story isn’t likely to go away anytime soon. In the meantime, all of Keillor’s personal appearances have been canceled, as has his weekday series “The Writer’s Almanac.” His hand-picked replacement behind the “Prairie Home” microphone, Chris Thile, has renamed the show “Live From Here.” </p>
<p>Not the boldest of titles, but maybe safe and predictable is just what fans of the St. Paul-based program need right now. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">When the Palace Theater reopened in March, local favorite Atmosphere was the first to perform at the St. Paul venue.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>There are several ways to view the Palace Theater, the 101-year-old St. Paul venue that reopened in March after a $15 million renovation. </p>
<p>It can be seen as the cultural capstone for outgoing Mayor Chris Coleman, long a champion of the arts. Or a key component in the revitalization of downtown St. Paul’s largely moribund-after-dinner nightlife scene. Or a major foray into St. Paul by First Avenue, Minneapolis’ landmark nightclub and ever-expanding promoter. </p>
<p>Or you can view the Palace simply as a great new place in which to experience live music. There is no other venue like it in the Twin Cities — an expansive, multitiered main floor for standing, a long balcony for seating, and good sightlines from almost every one of the 2,800 spots. </p>
<p>The inaugural year’s lineup was deliciously eclectic, from local heroes (the Jayhawks and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-s-palace-theatre-feels-like-a-second-first-ave/415999134/#1">Atmosphere</a>) to rock gods (Beck and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/wilco-s-emotional-three-night-farewell-adds-to-the-palace-s-luster/458630433/">Wilco</a>), cult figures (St. Vincent and Conor Oberst) and rising stars (Gary Clark Jr. and Fleet Foxes). Working with its partner, Chicago-based Jam Productions, First Avenue couldn’t have had a more successful launch, with sellout after sellout.</p>
<p>The fact that First Ave is <a href="http://www.startribune.com/first-avenue-to-open-new-restaurant-and-bar-adjoining-palace-theatre-in-st-paul/458854853/">taking over Wild Tymes</a>, the adjacent bar/restaurant that’s undergoing a renovation (with a planned reopening in the spring), will enhance one of the things we like most about the Palace. Located on the pedestrian-only 7th Place, it has a clubhouse-like feel. Unlike any other music venue in town, you could hang out on the plaza — have a smoke, kibitz with friends, enjoy ethnic food from the nearby Afro Deli or bar grub and a beer from the Wild Tymes. It all feels a bit private without being privileged or pretentious.</p>
<p>In short order, the Palace has become the Twin Cities’ own rock ’n’ roll clubhouse. And membership is open to anyone who buys a ticket. </p>

<p>From high above a Namibian desert, among the trees in Costa Rica and beside the Mississippi River in northern Minnesota, Star Tribune readers captured memorable images from their travels — and shared them with us for our weekly Viewfinders feature. </p>
<p>Early in December, members of the Travel team looked back over the year’s collection to find our favorites. We marveled at the beauties and surprises the world serves up to those who are fortunate enough to encounter — and record — them. We felt grateful for readers who so generously shared their work with us, bringing us their vision of the world. And, naturally, we oohed and aahed. I hope you do, too, as you check out this stellar collection of reader photos. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonpartisan group that tracks press freedoms, Mexico was the most dangerous place for journalists outside of war zones in 2017. A record six journalists were killed there. The deadliest countries for journalists were Iraq and Syria.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Yet another unacceptably dangerous year for journalists is winding down. </p>
<p>According to data compiled by the <a href="https://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ), 42 journalists worldwide were killed because of their work, and 262 journalists were jailed by governments hostile to a free press. Stateless actors held an additional 54 journalists, and two journalists are listed as missing, according to <a href="https://rsf.org/en">Reporters Without Borders</a>, which like CPJ is a leading media-freedom organization.</p>
<p>“There is no way to sugar coat it — this has been a terrible year for press freedom around the world,” CPJ said in a statement accompanying the stark statistics. </p>
<p>The year seems even worse because of the moral void left by President Donald Trump, whose relentless excoriating of the news media reduces the role of the U.S. president as an advocate of worldwide press freedom and bolsters repressive regimes that target journalists. </p>
<p>On a bipartisan basis, U.S. presidents have recognized the nation’s unique role as a beacon for media freedom and used their office’s unrivaled leverage to press adversary and ally alike to protect journalists. But now another phenomenon is occurring: Repressive regimes are echoing — and often acting upon — Trump’s characterization of unflattering coverage as “fake news.” </p>
<p>In just one example, the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s Communist Party, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-journalists-cpj-trump-assad-china-20171215-story.html">wrote</a>: “If the president of the United States claims that his nation’s media outlets are a stain on America, then negative news about China and other countries should be taken with a grain of salt, since it is likely that bias and political agendas are distorting the real picture.”</p>
<p>Press repression doesn’t just happen in nations such as China, which imprisoned 41 journalists last year, <a href="https://cpj.org/2017/12/record-number-of-jailed-journalists-for-second-yea.php">according to CPJ</a>, but also within the borders of allies such as Turkey, whose post-coup attempt at repression made it the world’s worst jailer of journalists this year after locking up 73. Egypt, another ostensible U.S. ally, is third, holding 20 journalists.</p>
<p>As for journalists killed for simply doing their jobs, <a href="https://cpj.org/2017/12/iraq-syria-deadliest-countries-for-journalists.php">CPJ reports</a> that the deaths of 42 in 2017 is actually a slight improvement from last year’s total.</p>
<p>The seemingly endless spirals of violence in the Mideast made Iraq and Syria the deadliest countries for journalists in 2017. But the scourge hit close to home, too, with a record six journalists killed in Mexico, as that nation’s unending drug war spares no societal sector. </p>
<p>The world — especially the U.S. — must do a better job protecting journalists. For their sake, of course. But also because the free flow of information is the only way to accurately acknowledge and address global problems. Indeed, the absence of real reporting would spur fake news, a real phenomenon meant to discredit reputable institutions and individuals and obscure abuses by disreputable regimes. Advocates have begun to rally the weight of the United Nations, but the U.S., starting with Trump, must lead on this vital issue. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Robert Mueller, the Justice Department’s special counsel, shown at the U.S. Capitol earlier this year, is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., recently warned that a “constitutional crisis” would erupt if President Donald Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump has not said that he will fire Mueller, but he has made clear his displeasure with Mueller’s investigation. Trump’s allies have been attacking Mueller’s integrity for weeks. And Trump’s earlier firing of FBI Director James Comey indicates a willingness to take such an extreme step. </p>
<p>But how extreme a step is it? Would a constitutional crisis really occur, and if it did, why would it matter? </p>
<p>The answers are not as obvious as most commentators, and some policymakers, seem to think. </p>
<p>“Constitutional crisis,” like “Russian collusion,” is not a legal term with an agreed meaning. What’s clear is that the temptation to define a constitutional crisis as any case in which the meaning of the Constitution is disputed deserves to be avoided. Virtually every clause of the Constitution is disputed, but crises are rare because Americans have shown they accept that ultimately the meaning will be settled by major government institutions. </p>
<p>The one undisputed constitutional crisis in American history was the Civil War. When the national government refused to recognize secession by the Southern states, an impasse arose because there was no way the disagreement could be resolved through constitutional means. Because the South rejected the national government, no national institution — not the federal courts, not Congress — could resolve the dispute. War resulted, with more than 600,000 deaths. </p>
<p>There have been a number of lesser crises that had a constitutional dimension but were not really “constitutional crises” because they were resolved through constitutional methods. The presidential elections of 1800 (eventually won by Thomas Jefferson), 1824 (won by John Quincy Adams), 1876 (won by Rutherford B. Hayes) and 2000 (won by George W. Bush) resulted in impasses because of ambiguities about voting or voting procedures, but they were all resolved — by negotiation in the first three cases and by the Supreme Court in the fourth. </p>
<p>Two impeachments and one near-impeachment also have been cited as constitutional crises. Andrew Johnson was impeached — though acquitted by the Senate — after he tried to fire his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, in violation of a statute passed by Congress to keep Stanton in office. Richard Nixon resigned before he was impeached, but he would very likely have been impeached for Watergate and related shenanigans. Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury (and acquitted) after carrying on an affair with a White House intern. In all three cases, a “political crisis” surely existed. Normal politics stopped while the impeachments were resolved. But in each case, the crisis was resolved through constitutional means, and most government institutions functioned normally. </p>
<p>Another frequently cited example is Franklin D. Roosevelt’s court-packing plan. During the Great Depression, a right-wing Supreme Court thwarted some of Roosevelt’s efforts to pull the government into the modern era so that it could address the economic calamity. After his landslide election in 1936, Roosevelt sought to increase the size of the Supreme Court so that he could appoint like-minded jurists to outvote hard-liners. Roosevelt’s effort outraged people, Congress refused to go along and Roosevelt backed down. Later, the court reversed course and was eventually dominated by Roosevelt’s own appointments. Roosevelt’s presidency included other moments of high constitutional drama, but Roosevelt was able to accomplish what he needed to do while staying within the system. </p>
<p>If Trump fires Mueller, another Civil War is not going to break out. The closest historical analogy is Nixon’s firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the “Saturday Night Massacre” of 1973. Nixon fired Cox to block the Watergate investigation. </p>
<p>At the time, many people declared that the firing sparked a constitutional crisis. And it surely felt that way — because no one knew how far Nixon would go to protect himself from further revelations and an eventual impeachment. But Nixon did not go very far. Cox was replaced by another special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who took up where Cox left off. Nixon ultimately obeyed an order from the Supreme Court to turn over the famous White House tapes. He did not pardon his subordinates, who went to jail. When informed that he would be impeached, he resigned rather than barricading himself in his office. </p>
<p>Whether (and how) a constitutional crisis might arise if Trump fires Mueller is rather mysterious. Trump may have the power to fire Mueller directly; even if he does not, he can ensure that someone else in the Justice Department fires Mueller, simply by firing anyone who refuses until someone does, as Nixon did. </p>
<p>Mueller could try to contest the firing in court. If a judge ordered Mueller’s reinstatement, and Trump obeyed, a crisis would be averted. If the judge ruled against Mueller, a crisis would also be averted. A crisis would occur only if a judge ordered reinstatement and Trump disobeyed. While possible, this seems unlikely. </p>
<p>Trump could also pardon everyone involved in the investigation. If he did, Mueller would have nothing to do. Again, there is no crisis. </p>
<p>Why, then, does Warner, like others, say that a constitutional crisis would occur? He may think that Congress will impeach Trump if he fires Mueller or issues blanket pardons. This does not seem likely for the time being, but even if impeachment hearings begin, we are still in the realm of the constitutional order. </p>
<p>Congress might also try to thwart Trump in other ways — by refusing to confirm his appointments or pass legislation that he wants. But this seems less like a crisis than business as usual. </p>
<p>What Warner is actually saying is that serious political consequences will follow if Trump fires Mueller. That may well be the case. Trump’s already dismal poll numbers might fall further; congressional Republicans might pay a price at the next election. But such consequences are political, not constitutional. If Trump and Republicans lose elections because Trump fires Mueller, then the constitutional system is working as it should. </p>
<p>If there is a constitutional dimension to a possible firing, it arises from a characteristic that Trump shares with Nixon: a demonstrated ruthlessness along with contempt for constitutional and political norms. This certainly may make us wonder what would happen if Congress or the courts really tried to put a halt to Trump’s obstruction of the Mueller investigation. </p>
<p>Trump is more likely to disobey a judicial order, or to withhold documents sought by Congress, or even to barricade himself in his office after being impeached and convicted, than Barack Obama or George Bush ever would have been. And if any of those things happened, then a constitutional crisis would exist. Once the president flagrantly violates constitutional norms, then it is no longer clear which part of the government citizens are supposed to obey. </p>
<p>While civil war remains as remote as ever, political unrest including possible violence and government paralysis seem like possible outcomes. </p>
<p>But all of this still seems pretty unlikely, and remote from where we are today. A lot would have to happen after Mueller is fired for a constitutional crisis to occur — not least, we would probably first need a Democratic victory in the 2018 congressional elections, without which impeachment hearings are unimaginable. </p>
<p>The element of truth in Warner’s admonition is that there is now a widespread feeling, especially on the left, that the constitutional system we have inherited has stopped operating properly. It allowed Trump to be elected despite his repudiation of many treasured constitutional values, and, even before Trump, the constitution seemed to lead too frequently to gridlock, interfering with governance rather than facilitating it. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Constitution builds in its own guarantee of obsolescence by requiring voting thresholds for amendments that can rarely be met in a large, heterogeneous and increasingly polarized society. If a constitutional crisis exists, this is it, and it will be with us long after Trump leaves office. </p>

                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p>On a warm day in September 1961, Rachel Lambert Mellon — known as Bunny — sat on a white bench on the White House lawn, underneath a stately magnolia tree, waiting to meet with President John F. Kennedy. Clad in Balenciaga, her posture ramrod straight, she looked the picture of aristocratic confidence. But in reality, she was anxious. </p>
<p>A month earlier, First Lady Jackie Kennedy — Mellon’s best friend — had called to alert her that the president was going to ask her to redesign the White House Rose Garden. Hours later, when he made the request during a picnic lunch on the beach at Mellon’s Cape Cod home, she initially resisted. Yes, she had created magnificent gardens at her estates in Upperville, Va., and the Cape, but Mellon told the president that she lacked the professional training to tackle this historic spot. </p>
<p>“As an amateur, I questioned my ability to design a garden of such importance,” she later wrote in an essay for White House History. “Paying little attention to that doubt, he bubbled with enthusiasm, with fascinating details of how he wanted a garden to appeal to the most discriminating taste, yet a garden that would hold a thousand people for a ceremony.” </p>
<p>For their first official White House meeting, she had brought along the Harvard-trained Washington landscape architect Perry Wheeler. They looked around the garden outside the Oval Office for inspiration, notably the handsome magnolia tree towering overhead. Andrew Jackson had planted the specimen in honor of his wife, Rachel, who died shortly after his 1828 election. </p>
<p>Today, that nearly 200-year-old tribute to presidential love is in its final days. As CNN reported this week, the Trump White House has decreed that the damaged and decayed Jackson magnolia will be torn down. </p>
<p>For all the examples of President Donald Trump the philistine, this decision appears to be based on horticultural realities rather than issues of taste. Trump admires Jackson; in January, he placed a portrait of his controversial predecessor in a prominent place in the Oval Office. </p>
<p>First ladies often preside over decisions involving the White House grounds and gardens. According to CNN, Melania Trump opted to tear down the tree after reading recommendations by the U.S. National Arboretum and consulting with her staff. One key staffer brings a special sensitivity to the landscaping at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue — White House social secretary Rickie Niceta, who is married to Bunny Mellon’s grandson Thomas Lloyd, knew her well. </p>
<p>When I was researching my biography of Mellon, who died in 2014 at the age of 103, I learned that the Jackson magnolia had been key to her redesign of the Rose Garden. John Kennedy had asked Mellon to create the equivalent of an elegant outdoor stage set for use as a backdrop for ceremonies and entertaining. </p>
<p>Mellon was baffled by how to create a unifying design until she strolled by the Frick Collection in Manhattan on a chilly day and spotted three magnolia trees, stripped of their leaves. “Their pale silvery branches with heavy twigs seemed to retain the light of summer,” she wrote. </p>
<p>Installing magnolias inspired by the Jackson tree turned out to be a complex task. After searching for mature specimens, Mellon fell in love with trees in one of most scenic spots in Washington — the Tidal Basin. The National Park Service turned down her request to uproot the trees; White House head gardener Irvin Williams had to pull strings to make it happen. </p>
<p>The Park Service then expressed concerns that digging so deep near the White House to plant the magnolias might disrupt underground cables. “Their only solution seemed to be to abandon the idea of any trees,” Wheeler wrote to Mellon. She and Wheeler won that argument. </p>
<p>But the Park Service’s concerns proved prescient. On March 31, 1962, a workman with a shovel accidentally severed the connection between the president’s office and the Strategic Air Command, which allowed Kennedy to direct the use of nuclear weapons. This created a momentary crisis, but Mellon insisted that the president did not complain to her. “This startling experience was handled with calmness; not even the president reprimanded us for the deep digging,” she would later write. </p>
<p>Now these magnolias, planted more than a half-century ago, will remain a touchstone to another era. With respect for the historic significance of the Jackson magnolia, the White House hopes to eventually replace its storied boughs with seedlings grown from the original. </p>

<p><span>W</span>hether you have enjoyed 2017 or thought it has left a lot to be desired, most of us would agree on this: An unbelievable number of things happened this year, creating a dizzying pace with which it was hard to keep up. If you retreated to the world of Minnesota sports for a sense of calm and happiness, you were generally rewarded. This year has, for the most part, been filled with positive local sports stories. There were more than enough of them to comprise a list twice as long as the one I ended up with, but sometimes you need to let the cream rise to the top. Here, then, is a look back at the top 10 Minnesota sports stories of 2017 — counting down from 10 to 1.</p>
<p><strong>10. Maple Grove football</strong></p>
<p><em>Scores three times in 59 seconds to win playoff game</em></p>

<p>This list is not specifically about moments, but the first item might be the single most incredible thing to happen in any high-level game in this state in 2017. </p>
<p>In the Class 6A football quarterfinals, Maple Grove trailed St. Michael-Albertville 27-10 in the final minute of play. From that point on, the Crimson scored a touchdown … recovered an onside kick … scored another touchdown … recovered another onside kick … and scored one more TD, all in a span of 59 seconds, to win 29-27. </p>
<p>“It just shows as bad as things might seem for you, you can never give up,” Maple Grove coach Matt Lombardi said after the game. </p>

<p>Minnesota fans love a team that wins, and the Gophers softball team captured imaginations — and later fueled indignations — with an incredible season. Minnesota was ranked No. 1 at one point and finished the regular season with a 54-3 record. </p>
<p>Despite those lofty achievements, the Gophers were not given a top-16 seed in the NCAA tournament and were instead sent on the road to Alabama for their regional. There, they went 2-2 and finished the year 56-5. Two months later, the coach who led the revival of the program, Jessica Allister, left to take the head job at her alma mater, Stanford. </p>

<p>The Twin Cities enhanced their reputation for being a pro sports mecca when Minnesota United made its debut in Major League Soccer in March. </p>
<p>Though their final results left plenty of room for improvement — the Loons won 10 games, lost 18 and tied six in their inaugural 34-match season — they built an impressive fan base at TCF Bank Stadium while construction began on their permanent home of Allianz Field in St. Paul. </p>

<p>There were plenty of pleasant surprises in 2017, but the first chronologically was the Gophers men’s basketball team. </p>
<p>A squad that won just eight games in 2015-16 rebounded to win three times as many in 2016-17, punctuating that turnaround with a berth in the NCAA tournament as a No. 5 seed. </p>
<p>Though the Gophers fell to Middle Tennessee State in the first round, the season generated renewed interest in the program. Minnesota is 11-3 this year heading into Saturday’s home game against Harvard. </p>

<p></p>
<p>I feel like this general topic has a permanent place on a yearly top 10 Minnesota sports stories list. Something awful, or strange, or amazing always seems to happen to Vikings quarterbacks. </p>
<p>This year’s QB situation is among the strangest of the strange. Starter Sam Bradford has played just six quarters all season. Backup Case Keenum, presumed to be an afterthought, not only has played but excelled — enough so that he’s kept Teddy Bridge-water, who returned from a major injury, from reclaiming his starting spot. </p>
<p>Oh, and now Bradford is slated to resume practice next week. The final chapter of this tale will be written in 2018. </p>

<p>Yes, it was technically early January of 2017 that “Row the Boat” changed from being a thing you might do at the lake in the summer to the mantra of an entire program. </p>
<p>P.J. Fleck, fresh off a 13-1 season at Western Michigan, was hired to replace Tracy Claeys and to alter the trajectory of Gophers football. His first season on the field played out as at least a temporary step back, as Minnesota went from nine wins to five, but an impressive recruiting class leaves hope for the future. </p>

<p>When it comes to franchise-altering deals, it’s clear that the Timberwolves’ draft night acquisition of Bulls star Jimmy Butler already has the potential to be one of the biggest in recent Minnesota sports history. </p>
<p>True, there is maybe some recency bias in that statement given Butler’s monster game Wednesday against Denver. But his acquisition, and subsequent additions of Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, have the Timberwolves on a path to reach the postseason for the first time since 2003-04. </p>

<p>In another year, this might be No. 1. You could make the case that it deserves to be at the top of this list. I’ll say this: You couldn’t go wrong with any of these final three being at the head of the list, but I went with the element of surprise over the tried and true champion when it came to the biggest stories of the years. </p>
<p>That shouldn’t take anything away from the Lynx’s fourth championship in seven seasons, achieved in remarkable fashion after coming back from a 2-1 series deficit against rival Los Angeles — with the Game 5 victory coming inside a boisterous Williams Arena. Center Sylvia Fowles was the MVP of both the regular season and the finals, a tremendous accomplishment. </p>

<p>The Twins left themselves plenty of room to improve in 2017 after a 59-103 dud in 2016. But few would have envisioned Minnesota gaining 26 victories to finish 85-77 and claim a Wild Card berth — particularly after the team fell below .500 and dealt away assets at the trading deadline. </p>
<p>The Twins offered plenty of moments of pure joy along the way, including the contributions of 44-year-old pitcher Bartolo Colon. They were an enjoyable team to watch, even if the year ended with a familiar postseason loss to the Yankees. </p>

<p></p>
<p>I thought the Vikings had a better chance of finishing 6-10 than 10-6 this year, and that was before they lost their starting quarterback and hotshot rookie running back. </p>
<p>As it turns out, they will finish neither 6-10 nor 10-6. Instead, they can finish 13-3 and lock up a first-round bye with a win over Chicago on Sunday. Doing so would put them just two wins away from becoming the first team in NFL history play in its home stadium for the Super Bowl. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Alex Stalock, far right, has never played more than 24 games in a season, but (if healthy) it sounds like the Wild envisions him breaking that mark. “Hopefully, [Dubnyk] when he comes back, he’s going to play great, and then we’ve got two good goalies that maybe we go to a little bit more,” Bruce Boudreau said.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Alex Stalock just kind of exudes that rather charming happy-to-be-here attitude. </p>
<p>The Wild’s backup goaltender has filled in admirably the past seven games and two periods for injured No. 1 Devan Dubnyk and has helped the team build up some momentum entering this second half of the season. But with Dubnyk slated to play in at least one of the back-to-back games with the Nashville Predators starting Friday night at Xcel Energy Center, Stalock is seeing his stretch come to an end. </p>
<p>But impressively, that isn’t a sore spot for sunny Stalock. </p>
<p>“It’s been fun, you know?” Stalock said. “I mean, I’ve never been able to go and play consecutive games in a row, I don’t think, in my career in the NHL. So that part was fun. I think just being able to go back in and feel good other than every two weeks. It’s tough when you jump in every two weeks. So, you know, it was a fun run to go in there and get games in a row. That’s the way I looked at it.” </p>
<p>In seven seasons in the NHL, the most games Stalock has amassed in a season was 24 in 2013-14 with the San Jose Sharks. The 30-year-old South St. Paul and Minnesota Duluth product has played in 16 games this season, his second with the Wild, including 14 starts. At 7-7-1, he has a 2.72 goals-against average and .915 save percentage with one shutout. </p>
<p>“He knows his job. He knows why he’s here,” coach Bruce Boudreau said of Stalock shifting back to backup. “He’s here to prove himself to stay in this league, and he’s proven himself. And he’s played a lot of games, but he’s always ready because he’s always working so hard on the ice. </p>
<p>“You know what? I always had a lot of confidence in him and confidence has never weighed in decisionmaking in playing Alex,” Boudreau said. “It’s just that sometimes your No. 1 guy needs to get 55 to 60 games in, and that was our goal. And right now, I mean, we’ve still got great confidence in Alex. And hopefully, [Dubnyk] when he comes back, he’s going to play great, and then we’ve got two good goalies that maybe we go to a little bit more.” </p>
<p>In Dubnyk’s 23 games this year, he is 12-8-2 with a 2.69 goals-against average, a .916 save percentage and three shutouts. </p>
<p>Dubnyk, who said he felt a “pop” in the first period of that Dec. 12 Calgary game that led to his lower-body injury, first skated again Dec. 21. And while he said there still is some pain, it’s manageable. Dubnyk said missing time like this was a first for him but having Stalock playing well made it easier. </p>
<p>“Oh, he was fantastic, and not that I would expect any different,” Dubnyk said. “I talked to him about that, like I said, first time I’ve had to go through something like this, and part of you feels a little bit guilty to not be in there and playing. But when you have a guy as your partner that you know is going to come in there and do a great job, it certainly helps that, and it helps the recovery process to know there’s a guy there that’s going to give the guys a chance to win.” </p>
<p>Stalock said having to quick change from practice tempo to game speed as a backup is tricky, and he’s enjoyed being able to establish a rhythm these past few weeks. But that doesn’t mean he’s not ready to relinquish the net to Dubnyk. </p>
<p>“Obviously, we need Dooby playing. He’s an elite goalie in this league, and we knew it was going to be tough with him out for two weeks or whatever it’s been,” Stalock said. “Whenever he comes back into the lineup, I think it’s a big lift for this room and a big lift for the team.” </p>
<p>So regardless of his relegation back to the bench, Stalock still will delight in his role. And he and Dubnyk — both big NFL fans and fantasy football players — still will maintain their tight bond. </p>
<p>“A lot of our stuff that we enjoy, hobbies, too, away from the ice is similar, and we both have kids similar ages, too, and it’s easy to get along and talk that stuff,” Stalock said. “It’s nice to be able to talk not just hockey all the time, and I think that’s one thing we enjoy, and it makes it light in the room. </p>
<p>“We obviously just want the best for each other for whoever’s in there, and at the end of the year, I think you’re going to see that that’s what’s going to give you the most success,” Stalock said. “So it’s good to have a partner like that.” </p>

        <title>Trump trains crosshairs on favorite target, again - Amazon</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By JOSEPH PISANI — Associated Press</h4>
<p>NEW YORK — President Donald Trump returned to a favorite target Friday, saying that Amazon.com should be charged more by the U.S. Postal Service for the packages it sends around the world. </p>
<p>Amazon has been a consistent recipient of Trump’s ire. He has accused the company of failing to pay “internet taxes,” though it’s never been made clear by the White House what the president means by that. </p>
<p>In a tweet Friday, Trump said Amazon should be charged “MUCH MORE” by the post office because it’s “losing many billions of dollars a year” while it makes “Amazon richer.” </p>
<p>Amazon lives and dies by shipping, and an increase in the rates it pays could certainly do some damage. Amazon sends packages via the post office, FedEx, UPS and other services. </p>
<p>In the seconds after the tweet, shares of Amazon, which had been trading higher before the opening bell, began to fade and went into negative territory. The stock closed down more than 1 percent Friday. Broader markets also slipped. </p>
<p>Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. The Post, as well as other major media, has been labeled as “fake news” by Trump after reporting unfavorable developments during his campaign and presidency. </p>
<p>He has labeled Bezos’ Post the “AmazonWashingtonPost.” </p>
<p>The Seattle company did not respond to a request for comment Friday. A spokeswoman for the Postal Service said, “We’re looking into it.” </p>
<p>Between July and September, Amazon paid $5.4 billion in worldwide shipping costs, a 39 percent increase from the same period in the previous year. That amounts to nearly 11 percent of the $43.7 billion in total revenue it reported in that same period. </p>
<p>In 2014, Amazon reached a deal with the Postal Service to offer delivery on Sundays. </p>
<p>Trump has also attacked U.S. corporations not affiliated in any way with the news media. </p>
<p>Just over a year ago, he tweeted “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” </p>
<p>Shares of Boeing Co. gave up almost 1 percent when trading opened that day, but recovered. </p>
<p>Several days later, and again on Twitter, he said that Lockheed-Martin, which is building the F-35 fighter jet, was “out of control.” Its shares tumbled more than 5 percent, but they too recovered. </p>
<p>The Postal Service has lost money for 11 straight years, mostly because of pension and health care costs. </p>
<p>One part of the operation that is not suffering, however, is shipping and packages, which handles Amazon and other online orders from retailers. In the year that ended Sept. 30, the postal service reported higher-than-expected revenue of $19.5 billion, “due to e-commerce growth.” </p>
<p>The post office does not break down what is driving that growth, but online orders from retailers, particularly Amazon.com, has revolutionized the way goods are bought and delivered. Analysts at Bain &amp; Co. expected Amazon to capture 50 percent of all online shopping growth during the holiday shopping season. </p>
<p>Amazon has taken some steps toward becoming more self-reliant in shipping. Earlier this year it announced that it would build a worldwide air cargo hub in Kentucky, about 13 miles southwest of Cincinnati. </p>
<p>Shares of Amazon.com Inc. slipped 1.4 percent Friday to close at $1,169.47. The Seattle company’s stock is up more than 57 percent this year and surpassed $1,000 each for the first time in April. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By RICHARD A. SOMMA — Associated Press</h4>
<h4>POLICE: SUSPECT WEARING “TRUST ME” T-SHIRT STEALS CAR </h4>
<p>FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — A suspect wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with “Trust Me” allegedly stole a car with an accomplice in Fairfax County, Virginia. </p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that the two suspects from Falls Church were arrested by police in the stolen car not long after the unlocked Honda Civic was taken as it warmed up. </p>
<p>Police say they also found several forged checks during the arrests. </p>
<p>The newspaper says Wilmer Lara Garcia has been charged with auto theft and two counts of forgery. Police say he was wearing the shirt that read “Trust Me.” </p>
<p>His accomplice was charged with auto theft. </p>
<h4>FLORIDA MAN SAYS HE PUNCHED ATM FOR GIVING TOO MUCH CASH </h4>
<p>COCOA, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man told investigators he punched an automatic teller machine because it gave him too much cash. </p>
<p>An arrest report says 23-year-old Michael Joseph Oleksik man caused about $5,000 in damage to an ATM at a Wells Fargo bank branch in Cocoa on Nov. 29. He was arrested Dec. 22 on a criminal mischief charge after bank officials decided to press charges. </p>
<p>Florida Today reports surveillance video captured Oleksik pummeling the touch screen. </p>
<p>An arrest report says that Oleksik told a bank manager he was angry that the machine was giving him too much money and he didn’t know what to do because he was in a hurry for work. He apologized for causing damage. </p>
<p>Jail records don’t list a lawyer for Oleksik. </p>
<h4>DEFINITION MISSION: A RHYMING LIMERICK FOR EACH ENGLISH WORD </h4>
<p>One man’s joke has become his mission: to give each word a rhyming definition. </p>
<p>Chris Strolin was teasing English buffs in an online forum years ago when he said the dictionary would be greatly improved if definitions were written as five-line limericks. Then he decided to try it for real. </p>
<p>The Omnificent English Dictionary in Limerick Form — or OEDILF (OH-dilf) for short — has published more than 97,000 rhyming definitions since Strolin started the online dictionary in 2004. He expects to reach limerick No. 100,000 sometime in 2018. </p>
<p>Even with help from roughly 1,000 contributing writers, Strolin’s limerick dictionary is nowhere near finished. It currently ends in the Gs at the word “gizzard.” </p>
<p>Strolin hopes his grandchildren — or perhaps their kids — will finish the Zs. </p>
<h4>WOMAN STUNNED TO FIND ELECTRIC BILL LISTED AS $284 BILLION </h4>
<p>ERIE, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania woman says she went online to check her electric bill and was stunned at the amount — more than $284 billion. </p>
<p>The Erie Times-News reports that Mary Horomanski said her eyes “just about popped out” of her head when she saw the amount. She suspected that her family had put up their Christmas lights wrong. </p>
<p>The silver lining was that she didn’t have to pay the full amount until November 2018 — only a $28,156 minimum payment was due for December. </p>
<p>Horomanski’s son contacted Penelac, her electric provider, who confirmed the error. Parent company First Energy said a decimal point was accidentally moved. Her new amount was quickly corrected to $284.46. </p>
<h4>STYLIST ACCUSED OF GIVING MAN UNWANTED ‘STOOGES’ HAIRDO </h4>
<p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Police in Madison, Wisconsin, arrested a hairstylist after he gave a customer a very unwanted Larry Fine hairdo. </p>
<p>Police spokesman Joel DeSpain says the 22-year-old victim told officers the stylist asked him to stop fidgeting and moving his head during the Friday haircut. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that DeSpain says the stylist then nicked the customer’s ear with his clippers before running them down the middle of the man’s head on their shortest attachment, “leaving him looking a bit like Larry from ‘The Three Stooges.’” </p>
<p>DeSpain says officers arrested the 46-year-old hairstylist, Khaled A. Shabani, who pleaded not guilty to disorderly conduct Wednesday. DeSpain says Shabani told officers it was an accident. </p>
<h4>WOMAN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNORT COCAINE IN POLICE STATION </h4>
<p>LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) — A woman has been accused of trying to snort cocaine inside a Connecticut police station while waiting to be booked on unrelated charges. </p>
<p>Police say Nicole Hunter was charged on Christmas Day with possession of narcotics, interfering with an officer and disorderly conduct. </p>
<p>Police had arrested Hunter after a confrontation at her home in Ledyard while investigating a report of an erratic driver. They say the vehicle involved matched the one in Hunter’s driveway. </p>
<p>Police say Hunter was in a waiting area of the police station when she pulled cocaine wrapped in paper from inside her clothing and tried to snort it. </p>
<p>Hunter doesn’t have a listed phone number and can’t be reached for comment. She’s due in court Jan. 8. </p>
<h4>ANTI-GAMBLING CRUSADER WINS $25K IN GAMING SWEEPSTAKES </h4>
<p>CHICAGO (AP) — A suburban Chicago woman who has crusaded against gambling for decades has won $25,000 by playing a sweepstakes game at a gambling cafe. </p>
<p>Kathy Gilroy tells the Chicago Tribune that while it’s ironic she won the sweepstakes, the distinction is that she didn’t spend her own money to gamble. </p>
<p>Gilroy has said gambling can lead to addiction, bankruptcy, crime and suicide. She helped shut down a $1.6 million Queen of Hearts raffle put on by the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in rural Morris this year until the raffle was properly licensed. </p>
<p>Gilroy says she’s participated in other sweepstakes and won prizes, including electronics and trips to the Bahamas and California. She says she enters sweepstakes because they’re made available free of charge under state law. </p>
<h4>POLICE: WOMAN RUINED $300K WORTH OF ART ON DATE WITH LAWYER </h4>
<p>HOUSTON (AP) — Authorities say an intoxicated Dallas woman on a first date with a prominent Houston trial lawyer caused at least $300,000 in damage to his art collection, including two Andy Warhol paintings. </p>
<p>Lindy Lou Layman was arrested Saturday on criminal mischief charges after her date with Anthony Buzbee. She was released on $30,000 bond. Online court records don’t list an attorney for her. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say Buzbee told investigators that the 29-year-old Layman got too intoxicated on their date, so he called her an Uber after they returned to his home. She allegedly refused to leave and hid inside the home, and that when Buzbee found her and called a second Uber, she got aggressive. </p>
<p>Authorities say she tore down several paintings and poured red wine on some, and she threw two $20,000 sculptures. </p>
<p>The damaged Warhol paintings were each valued at $500,000. </p>
<h4>MAN CHARGED WITH SNEAKING INTO HOME TO TRY TO STEAL UNDIES </h4>
<p>WASHINGTON, Mo. (AP) — Police say an eastern Missouri man told officers he has an “underwear fetish” and admitted to sneaking into a home to try to steal a pair. </p>
<p>The St. Louis Post- Dispatch reports that 34-year-old Cody Hassler, of Washington, Missouri, was charged Wednesday with first-degree burglary, first-degree stalking and stealing. No attorney is listed in online court records. Bond is set at $75,000. </p>
<p>Police say Hassler admitted to sneaking into the house through an unlocked basement door in October while a mother and her teenage daughter were sleeping and taking a pair of underwear from the laundry room. </p>
<p>The teenager awoke when she heard footsteps and police were called. Officers found a pair of underwear that apparently had been dropped when the suspect fled. Hassler also admitted to looking through bedroom windows. </p>
<h4>BURNT BAGEL BLAMED FOR ST. LOUIS AIRPORT EVACUATION </h4>
<p>ST. LOUIS (AP) — A burnt bagel is being blamed for the evacuation of a terminal at Lambert Airport in St. Louis. </p>
<p>Airport officials say a bagel burned in a restaurant in Terminal 2 around 6 p.m. Tuesday, setting off smoke detectors and prompting a full evacuation. An estimated 300 to 400 people were required to go outside, where the temperature was 11 degrees. </p>
<p>The airport says the evacuation lasted only about five minutes, but passengers had to go back through security checks once they re-entered the building. No flight delays were reported. </p>
<h4>A COUGAR IN YOUR LUGGAGE? HUNTING CARCASS FOUND AT AIRPORT </h4>
<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Police say a hunter’s trip home hit a snag in Las Vegas after security screeners found a dead cougar in his luggage. </p>
<p>No crime was committed because the man had a hunting tag. But police Lt. David Gordon told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Transportation Security Administration agents held the man at McCarran International Airport late Tuesday to confirm the validity of the Utah hunting tag. </p>
<p>His name and where he was headed weren’t released. </p>
<p>Airport spokeswoman Melissa Nunnery says the man ended up shipping the cougar carcass home, not on the airplane. </p>
<p>Gordon says it’s not a crime to transport legally possessed game on an airline flight. But he says airlines can refuse to transport certain items. </p>
<h4>LIFELONG BEST FRIENDS DISCOVER THEY’RE ACTUALLY BROTHERS </h4>
<p>HONOLULU (AP) — Two Hawaii men who grew up as best friends have recently learned that they’re actually brothers. </p>
<p>Alan Robinson and Walter Macfarlane have been friends for 60 years. Born in Hawaii 15 months apart, they met in the sixth grade and played football together at a Honolulu prep school. </p>
<p>Macfarlane never knew his father. Robinson was adopted. </p>
<p>Honolulu news station KHON-TV reports that the men learned they’re related through a family history and DNA website. They revealed the discovery Saturday. </p>
<p>Macfarlane’s daughter, Cindy Macfarlane-Flores, says when they started digging into answers about his family history, a top DNA match was someone with the username Robi737. </p>
<p>Robinson’s nickname was “Robi” and he flew 737s for Aloha Airlines. </p>
<p>They plan to travel and enjoy retirement together. </p>
<p>Robinson says it’s the best Christmas present. </p>
<h4>POLICE: MAN ATTEMPTS TO ROB STORE WITH FAKE FURNITURE GUN </h4>
<p>AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Police say a man who tried and failed to rob an Ohio convenience store with a fake gun made from pieces of furniture has been charged with robbery. </p>
<p>Akron police say the man walked into a local Circle K store Monday afternoon waving what appeared to be a rifle and demanding cash. An employee realized the rifle was a fake and confronted the man with the help of three customers. </p>
<p>The man tried to flee but was subdued and detained by the people in the store until police arrived. He has been charged with aggravated robbery and is scheduled to appear in municipal court Wednesday. </p>
<p>Police say the man had a pole, a fake scope, a spring and two table legs fastened together to look like a rifle. </p>
<h4>FRUITCAKE PACKAGE TEMPORARILY HALTS SEATTLE FERRY SERVICE </h4>
<p>SEATTLE (AP) — Authorities say a wrapped present that turned out to be a fruitcake temporarily halted service at a Seattle ferry terminal while police investigated. </p>
<p>Washington State Patrol Trooper Kevin Fortino says troopers were notified Tuesday that a suspicious package was found beneath a Christmas tree in the pedestrian waiting area. </p>
<p>Fortino says the package was deemed suspicious because it was unmarked and was the only gift under the tree. </p>
<p>Officials evacuated the terminal and kept all inbound ferries away for about a half-hour while the police bomb squad investigated. </p>
<p>Fortino says the gift was found to be a fruitcake. </p>
<p>He says it wasn’t clear why it was left at the terminal. </p>
<h4>MAN ARRESTED AFTER SHOWING UP TO CLAIM MARIJUANA SHIPMENT </h4>
<p>WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) — Police in Massachusetts have arrested a Rhode Island man they say showed up at a shipping company in a brand-new pickup truck he had paid cash for to claim two crates that contained 112 pounds of marijuana. </p>
<p>Wareham police say they were tipped off by employees of Cape Cod Express, who were suspicious of the two wooden crates. </p>
<p>When 40-year-old Michael Chen, of Providence, Rhode Island, showed up at the facility on Wednesday to claim them, he was confronted by police and consented to a search of the crates. </p>
<p>Police say they contained 112 pounds of pot combined. </p>
<p>Chen was charged with trafficking in marijuana over 100 pounds. Police also seized his 2017 pickup. </p>
<p>He was freed on $7,500 bail. It was not clear if he had a lawyer. </p>
<h4>DRUGS, GUN, TEETH FOUND ON MAN STOPPED AT S. CAROLINA STORE </h4>
<p>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) — Police say they found thousands of doses of heroin, a gun and human teeth on a man detained during a suspected shoplifting investigation at a South Carolina Walmart on Christmas Eve. </p>
<p>Officers tell the Sun News of Myrtle Beach they charged 21-year-old Tavon Malik Stanley of Calabash, North Carolina, with crimes including heroin trafficking and drug possession. </p>
<p>Officials at a North Myrtle Beach Walmart detained Stanley after they saw a person with him allegedly take around $25 worth of items without paying for them. Stanley had a Ruger 9 mm handgun and more than $2,500 in cash, and officers found dozens of pills, thousands of doses of heroin and two human teeth in his backpack. </p>
<p>Stanley was released from jail on bond. It wasn’t known if he had an attorney. </p>

<p><strong>James Lunning </strong><em>“Walker” from Minneapolis who completed Triple Crown of hiking (Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails)</em></p>
<p>I finished the last bit of the Pacific Crest Trail in February, and made it to the West Coast, completing my objective to go coast to coast. Then I walked through the desert of the Southwest and spent time hanging out and rock climbing in Utah. I thru-hiked the Continental Divide Trail, and ended up hitchhiking home shortly after I finished in September. Since then I have been laying low. My big plan for 2018 is to thru-hike with my mother the John Muir Trail in California. Afterward I’m planning to try to climb as many of the West Coast volcanoes as I can before the weather shifts for the year. In 2017, I hiked somewhere in the neighborhood of 4,500 to 5,000 miles, bringing the total mileage for my walk to a bit more than 16,000 miles.

<p><strong>Seth Feider </strong><em>Professional angler from Isle, Minn., whose star rose after winning the Toyota Bassmaster Angler of the Year Championship in 2016 on Mille Lacs</em></p>
<p>My main goal for 2017 was to qualify for the Bassmaster Classic, which I did thanks to a 14th-place finish on the Bassmaster Elite Series. After the fishing season ended, I did a lot of duck and grouse hunting around Lake Mille Lacs. I also spent a few days in December hunting ducks and fishing trout along the Missouri River in the mountains of Montana, and after that turned my attention to next year. I’m fishing the Elite Series again, but I’m really focused on the Classic, which is March 16-18 on Lake Hartwell in South Carolina. My mindset is that it’s pretty much a winner-take-all tournament, so I’ll take the biggest risks I can to try to win it. Then after that, it’s back to the stressful fishing where every ounce counts for the whole season.

<p><strong>Nick Hoffman </strong><em>Musician and Outdoor Channel star</em></p>
<p>In 2017, I spent a lot of time traveling around the world filming for “Nick’s Wild Ride” on the Outdoor Channel, and in the studio recording my first solo record (which will come out in 2018). As part of the show, next year I’ll be hunting for ibex in Spain, alligators in Florida and whitetail deer in southeastern Minnesota. I’ve also gotten involved with organizations that are involved in protecting our public lands, which are under attack. I’m really happy to be able to use the platform that “Nick’s Wild Ride” gives me to bring attention to that issue. So I guess if I have a New Year’s resolution, it’s to focus on doing whatever I can to bring attention to the threats our public lands face.

<p><strong>Ruth Hoefs </strong><em>Ducks Unlimited chairwoman</em></p>
<p>This year marked my first as Ducks Unlimited state chairwoman for Minnesota. It was exciting to be in that position as we celebrated our 80th anniversary and crossed the 14 million-acre threshold of habitat conserved across North America. One highlight was spending three days in Washington, D.C., working with our conservation policy team. Next year will be important as Congress writes a new farm bill. We’ll be working hard on that and making sure conservation is well-represented. I’m also excited to continue working with our 3,285 volunteers in Minnesota to conserve and protect habitat, and make sure we have clean water.

<p><strong>Erick Harcey </strong><em>Renowned Twin Cities restaurateur</em></p>
<p>Fishing was great in 2017 — I found new spots and spent a lot of time in the boat with the kids. We did a little walleye fishing, but it was mostly bass, crappies and sunfish. Next year, I look forward to bigger-fish fishing with my older boys, and also to taking some longer trips. I definitely want to get in a sturgeon trip to the Rainy River. We got a dog a couple of months ago — a springer spaniel named Hank — so I hope to have him really well-trained for bird hunting by next season. I also learned this year that I’ve underestimated the number of deer on our land near Cambridge. I’ll be putting out more stands for next year’s deer season.

<p><strong>Courtney Dauwalter </strong><em>Elite ultramarathon runner and Minnesota native</em></p>
<p>I ran the Moab 240 Mile Endurance Run in mid-October in about 58 hours. This was farther than I had ever raced, and I spent the remainder of October resting, eating and getting out for short runs around my neighborhood in Colorado. In November, I was able to get in some solid weeks of training in order to prepare for my last race of the year at the beginning of December: the Soochow International Ultra-Marathon 24 Hour Racestyle, held on a 400-meter track in Taiwan. At the 24-hour race, I set a new American women’s record of 159.3 miles. Looking ahead to 2018, I am really excited to continue to push the limits of what is both physically and mentally possible by competing in many ultramarathons ranging in distances from 50 miles to 200-plus miles.

<p><strong>Tony Roach </strong><em>Minnesota fishing guide</em></p>
<p>In 2017, we saw a huge uptick in people coming to Minnesota to fish bass, which was really cool. That’s a whole new sector of tourists coming here to experience our quality bass fishing. For the coming year, I see a lot of changes in the demographics of the outdoor industry. We’re seeing a lot of younger anglers in their teens and 20s. I was worried a few years back that we were losing a whole generation of sportsmen and anglers, so it’s really nice to see them getting into it. And I see continued growth in ice fishing. I’m getting a lot of calls from people who live outside the Ice Belt and haven’t ice-fished before, but are coming up next year to try it.

<p><strong>Nick Blanco </strong><em>Featured in reality show “Building Alaska,” a Minnesota native who is building a hunting and fishing lodge</em></p>
<p>We had a big setback this fall. The main building burned down on Oct. 19. It caught fire through the roof, where the stove went through. It sucks, but it was a learning experience. Fire prevention is important. I’m getting an industrial pump to use as a fire hose, and I think the three cabins I’m going to build will have electric heat. But nothing I did was in vain. I learned a lot, and think I can rebuild in half the time it took me. I’m going to rebuild and I still have the Quonset hut, and hope to have deer hunters in there this fall. Being on “Building Alaska” was fantastic. Everything was really positive. There’s talk that they might come back for my rebuild this summer. I’m still going to build what I said I would — I’m putting my money where my mouth is, I promise that.

<p>Everyone at Manitou Crossing Kennels has been busy training and preparing for the upcoming racing season. The dogs are healthy and strong and have covered hundreds of miles of trails since August. There is a good base of snow on the trails now, and we have been able to make the transition from running teams in front of ATVs to sleds. Our first race of the new year will be the Gunflint Mail Run on Jan. 6-7 in Grand Marais, followed by the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon (Jan. 26-31). Mid-February, we will have two teams at the UP200 in Marquette, Mich. Ely’s Wolf Track Classic is Feb. 24-25. In early March, we may be traveling to Fort Kent, Maine, for the Can-Am 250. We hope for more good snow and cold weather to make safe ice for the races. (Back-story <a href="http://www.startribune.com/huskies-at-the-center-of-a-family-on-the-go/410548025/">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Scott Bush </strong><em>Disabled paddler in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</em></p>
<p>Our Boundary Waters trip was more challenging than I anticipated but a great experience. My boys have talked about it several times, and we really enjoy watching our little video diary on YouTube. My wife, Jessica, and I went to the International Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque, N.M., this fall and did two great hikes: Tent Rocks and the La Luz Trail. We also went to Scottsdale, Ariz., in November with a group of around 20 friends to hike Tom’s Thumb Trail. In 2018, we’re taking the overnight Amtrak for skiing in Winter Park, Colo. For spring break, we’re traveling with our kids to China to climb the Great Wall, see the Terracotta Army and visit Haikou in the Hainan province. In August, we’ll visit Kennebunkport, Maine, for a week of golf and hanging out on the beach.

<p><strong>Cindy Dillenschneider </strong><em>Inventor-outdoorist, One-Arm Freedom Canoe Paddle</em></p>
<p>In 2017, I hit 60 and passed a two-year, cancer-free milestone. In gratitude for good health, my husband, our Australian shepherd and I spent 17 days canoe-camping in the remote wilderness of Ontario. As usual, we left behind all electronics, buried our watches, and immersed ourselves in the rhythms and sacred space of nature. We live near national forest lands and Lake Superior, and spend a lot of time hiking, paddling and foraging for wild foods. This winter, we look forward to snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Scott Bush’s trip with his sons in the BWCA last summer inspired me. In 2018, I’ll distribute the One-Arm Freedom Canoe Paddle more broadly to help others access the outdoors. It is my hope that providing access to canoeing helps others find value in wildness and will help preserve public lands for future generations. As Henry David Thoreau stated, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” </p>

<p>My final tally for the 2017 banding season was 132 birds. Last year we caught 170. We got fewer birds this year because of a skunked weekend and a weather-called weekend. Our ninth and last weekend of banding was canceled due to the snowstorm in late October. We’ll be starting up again the first weekend of September 2018. We get lots of birds visiting each year, but we also get a good number of relatives, friends, falconers, birders and students coming up to share in the fun. I did a tally again this year of individuals who were up enjoying our banding activities. I counted each person only once, even if they came up multiple times. We had 64 individuals and seven organized groups with 56 people. A total of 120 guests were able to have an exceptional hawk-viewing experience up at our site this year!

<p><strong>Jerry Stenger</strong> <em>Videographer for explorer Will Steger</em></p>
<p>Through working with Will Steger, I was fortunate to acquire a piece of land outside of Ely years ago where our family has been building a hand-scribed log cabin. The Boundary Waters border is 100 feet from the front door. It’s offered an amazing opportunity to fish, kayak, cross-country ski and share wilderness experience with my son, Landon, 11. This year, he completed his first cycle of catching, cleaning, cooking and eating walleye. He’s hooked. Each year brings the excitement of planning the next series of trips into lakes and woods. For nearly 35 years, I’ve been part of a men’s group we call the Lost Boys of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. It’s a wonderful experience to raise our kids so close to a large wilderness area and teach them the importance of stewardship. My goal for 2018 is to sneak more of my gear into my son’s backpack on those long portages.

<p>By the time our 2017 season ended with our last race on Thanksgiving morning, Mile in My Shoes (MiMS) had helped 89 people experiencing homelessness run their first mile toward transformation. Thirty-four of them went on to complete at least one 5-kilometer race, and five ran the Twin Cities Marathon — all 26.2 miles! Watching our new runners get hooked on something so positive and healthy is what keeps me inspired, both in this work and in my own personal running. But the greatest gift I receive is watching these incredibly fierce bonds grow between people who live in shelters and people who have never been inside one. Looking to 2018, I understand better each day that Mile in My Shoes is not a charity that “saves” one group. We are not teams of haves and have-nots. We recognize that every one has something unique to share, something to offer to others. MiMS morning runs are the catalysts for those exchanges, until we find ourselves transformed. Everyone has the opportunity to experience this when we run a mile in someone else’s shoes. I hope to bring this experience to as many people as possible in 2018, because we can unite our communities one person at a time.

<p><strong>Garrett Mikrut</strong> <em>Minnesota grouse hunter</em></p>
<p>I was really anticipating the 2017 grouse season after hearing reports of the strong spring-drumming counts. The woods were thick and hot the first few weeks of the season, making for tough conditions for hunters and dogs. There were plenty of local woodcock around, but grouse were more difficult to find. My most memorable bird was one I shot in open hardwoods over my German shorthair. It was a long shot, but I hit the bird, and Surly made a nice retrieve. With mild weather in November and December, hunting improved later in the season. I’m already thinking about next year and planning a sharp-tailed grouse hunt on the Montana prairie. I also am looking forward to my annual ruffed grouse hunt in the Great Lakes states.

They were creative, resilient and forward-looking, reaching back, after personal success, to help others rise. “Be kind to all that live,” was the Buddhist creed of one who spent years in a Japanese internment camp. Sculptors, writers, cooks, entertainers and that reliable voice on the radio in the background of a beautiful fall day. They nourished us with food, laughter, music and the examples they set in life.

                                    </div>
<p>Susan Carr and Chelsea Couillard-Smith are experts at reading the public’s whims, at least when it comes to reading. </p>
<p>Carr and Couillard-Smith are selectors (libraryspeak for book buyers) for the Hennepin County Library. </p>
<p>They’re among six librarians within the Hennepin County system who are making hundreds of decisions each day on which books the 41 branches in the library will get — and not get. </p>
<p>With an acquisition budget of about $7.5 million that is used to buy about 700,000 titles a year, Hennepin County Library is one of the nation’s biggest institutional book buyers. And according to Carr and Couillard-Smith, those purchases are highly attuned to the changing reading tastes and fluctuations in the public zeitgeist. </p>
<p>“We’re constantly monitoring how many requests are placed on books,” she said. </p>
<p>According to Carr, 2017 was the year for the Instant Pot cookbook. She said the programmable kitchen appliance spawned requests from library patrons for some of the 150 Instant Pot cookbooks that have come onto the market. </p>
<p>“Demand is insatiable,” she said. </p>
<p>The past year also saw an uptick in demand for dystopian novels ranging from “The Handmaid’s Tale” to “1984.” The library also had to reorder backlist political books like “Rules for Radicals” by Saul Alinsky and “Animal Farm” by George Orwell. </p>
<p>And another sleeper hit for library patrons this year was <a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/5538930109">“Astrophysics for People in a Hurry,” by Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>.</p>
<p>Other 2017 favorites from Carr and Couillard-Smith: </p>
<h4>• <a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/5559107109">“The First Rule of Punk,”</a> by Celia C. Pérez a debut novel for middle-grade readers that blends “traditional tween challenges like a new school, parental tension and social hierarchies with punk rock, Mexican-American culture and zines,” according to Couillard-Smith.</h4>
<h4>• <a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/5494722109">“One Last Word: Wisdom From the Harlem Renaissance,”</a> by Nikki Grimes, is a poetry collection that connects themes of racism, identity and pride from the Harlem Renaissance to the present day. “I think everyone should read it whether or not they like poetry,” Couillard-Smith said.</h4>
<h4>• <a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/5564888109">“The Prague Sonata,” </a>by Bradford Morrow, a mystery about a lost musical manuscript, is on Carr’s must-read list. “This one is epic. It took him 12 years to research this book,” she said.</h4>
<h4>• <a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/5550162109">“Sing, Unburied, Sing,” </a>a novel by Jesmyn Ward about an epic road trip and the struggles of an African-American family, won a National Book Award and an endorsement by Carr. “This one just shimmers,” she said.</h4>
<h3>Reaching a broader audience </h3>
<p>When it comes to ordering the latest by a bestselling author, the selectors don’t bother to read book reviews. They just need to decide how many copies to get. They might buy up to 300 to 400 copies of a John Grisham novel to keep the reserve list down to three to five people in line per copy. </p>
<p>Library patrons can and do put books on hold up to six months or even a year before the library acquires a copy, Carr said. </p>
<p>“Our patrons are so savvy with what’s happening the world of publishing,” Carr said. “The author might have said, ‘I’m thinking of writing a book …’ And we’ll get a request for it.” </p>
<p>On the other hand, the library is taking chances on books that it might not have bought in the past. They’re stocking more books by self-published authors to make sure nontraditional voices are included in the collection, including minority fiction and works with LGBTQ themes. </p>
<p>“We’re reassessing the way self-publishing fills some important gaps in our collection,” Couillard-Smith said. </p>
<p>Self-published books also make up many of the popular titles in the “new adult” genre, a post-young adult category featuring protagonists in their 20s. </p>
<p>“Our patrons are crazy about those,” Couillard-Smith said. </p>
<h3>Obliging gatekeepers </h3>
<p>Carr said the library gets about 300 requests a week from patrons to add a particular title to the collection. Not all can be filled. </p>
<p>“We have to be good stewards of our budget,” Carr said. </p>
<p>When making their decisions, the selectors consider book reviews, whether other libraries think a book is worth purchasing and the library’s mission to serve the general public. But Couillard-Smith said the library “tries to find as many ways as possible to say yes” to a book purchase. </p>
<p>“We are really conscious of our role as gatekeepers,” she said. </p>
<p>So the library will sometimes buy books that no other library has, or books that no bookseller will stock. </p>
<p>Couillard-Smith said she once purchased a self-published children’s book about a family dealing with miscarriage after she got a request from a library patron. </p>
<p>“Almost every book gets checked out at least once,” Couillard-Smith said. “If it makes one or two of the patrons happy, it has served its purpose. </p>
<p>“It’s a bigger fail if someone comes in and we don’t have it,” she said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>There are memorable Christmas gifts, and then there are really memorable gifts. Like, say, an engagement ring. </p>
<p>According to wedding experts and social media sites, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day are the most popular days of the year to pop the question, followed by New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. (Yes, Valentine’s Day proposals are still a thing, but they’re proving less popular these days.) </p>
<p>“It’s a special, emotional time,” says Matthew Rosenheim, president of the Tiny Jewel Box in Washington, D.C. “People are around family, and they want to share those special moments when there’s time to enjoy it without some of the pressures of day-to-day life.” </p>
<p>The Knot, the online brand that celebrates all things engagement and wedding with unbridled enthusiasm, has a “How He Asked” website specifically dedicated to proposals — and five pages devoted just to holiday engagements. </p>
<p>There’s a Rockefeller Center Tree proposal, the ice skating rink proposal, the tree farm proposal, several “Will you marry me?” in Christmas lights proposals, all recorded by a photographer or videographer hiding in the bushes. There’s even one that doubled down on the “Awww” factor: A surprise French bulldog puppy under the tree, with a “Will you marry me?” tag hanging from its collar. </p>
<p>All of this requires military-style planning, especially during what is now known as “engagement season.” </p>
<p>“We definitely see a spike in December,” says Dino Pampillonia, co-owner of Pampillonia Jewelers in D.C. “Generally, it’s couples who come in. But during the holiday season, it’s guys wanting to do a surprise.” </p>
<p>Most, he says, tell him they plan to propose by Christmas, although it can be a few days before or afterward. </p>
<p>What’s important, his customers say, is that “all the families are together, and they want it as a family event.” </p>
<p>Unlike the movies, most people do not walk into a jewelry store and walk out that day with an engagement ring — most buyers take four to six weeks. The annual parade of single men wandering into jewelry stores begins in November, many with only a vague idea of what kind of ring to buy. </p>
<p>“They have done some research and they’ve asked some questions,” says Pampillonia. </p>
<p>Some, however, decide at the very last minute on a surprise proposal. Every year, the Tiny Jewel Box gets at least one customer who walks in and is willing to pay big bucks — but has to pick up the ring by Christmas Eve. </p>
<p>According to the Knot’s Real Weddings Survey, the average cost of an engagement ring in the United States is just over $6,000, but can be less or much, much more. Rosenheim just sold a seven-carat, cushion-cut diamond ring for $350,000. (The proposal already happened and, yes, she said yes.) </p>
<p>There is some debate among etiquette experts about whether an engagement ring counts as a Christmas present, or if another present should be under the tree. Depends on the couple and the circumstances, most agree. </p>
<h3>Legal considerations </h3>
<p>But there’s another, less romantic consideration for slipping another gift under the tree: the legal issue. </p>
<p>Although December is the biggest month for engagement ring sales, legal experts (those unsentimental pragmatists who find the downside in everything) warn that holiday proposals have a built-in risk. </p>
<p>Legally, an engagement ring is considered a “conditional gift” based on the marriage taking place and the ring goes back to the purchaser if the engagement is broken, regardless of who ends it. But rings given on Christmas, Valentine’s Day or birthdays are typically classified as more traditional gifts, and the majority of courts allowed the receiver to keep it. </p>
<p>No one ever talks about that in a Hallmark Christmas movie. </p>
<p>When expectations are high and everyone else is posting engagement photos on Facebook, Rosenheim has this small piece of advice to longtime boyfriends shopping for a Christmas present: “If you’re not going to give her an engagement ring she might be anticipating, no ring-size boxes for you. Don’t pull out a square box if it’s not what she really wants.” </p>
<p>And every jeweler sees some of those men in January. </p>
<p>“It’s like clockwork,” says Rosenheim. “You can tell by the expression on their faces. Their significant others were anticipating a Christmas engagement or a New Year’s Eve engagement, and the next big thing is Valentine’s Day. We all know we’re going to see those customers who say, ‘Yeah, I should have done it. I didn’t. And here I am now.’ ” </p>

                                            <img alt="itemprop" src="http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_151456590344863.jpg">

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">The Amazon Echo Dot speaker sells for $49.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Q: My wife and I have been discussing electronic personal assistants. Which do you prefer, Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri? </p>
<p>A: Technically, they are different things with slightly different functions. Siri is a smartphone assistant, while Alexa is a home assistant. </p>
<p>That being said, I much prefer Amazon’s Alexa, mainly because it actually works almost 100 percent of the time. I can’t say the same about Siri these days. I don’t know what happened, but Siri has become so unreliable that I now refer to it as a personal irritant, not personal assistant. It has been screwing up simple commands like “Call Dad” with increasing regularity, and sometimes it takes several tries to get a response at all. And it’s not just a problem with my phone; other people report the same frustrations. </p>
<p>Alexa is very reliable, and I use it regularly when I’m home. An Amazon speaker with Alexa, even the $49 Echo Dot, makes the greatest alarm clock ever. Every night I say, “Alexa, set an alarm for 7:30 a.m.,” and the speaker replies that the alarm is set. Then I say, “Alexa, set an alarm for 7:40 a.m.,” so I have a backup. When the alarm goes off in the morning I say, “Alexa, cancel all alarms.” If I don’t know what alarms I have set, I say, “Alexa, what are my alarms?” and it will tell me. </p>
<p>Alexa and linked devices can do reminders and timers, serve as a household intercom, control your thermostat and lighting, shop, play music and provide information, news and weather from anywhere in the world. You can make phone and video calls, integrate a security system with cameras and pet monitors, and even play “Jeopardy!” via voice commands. It is easy and fun to use, and you can start with a single Echo Dot and expand from there ( <a href="http://">amazon.com</a>).</p>
<h3>For the record </h3>
<p>Q: I have heard that new vinyl records of old albums have very poor sound quality and you should buy used, original versions to get the best sound. Is this true? </p>
<p>A: I don’t buy much new vinyl these days because I already have thousands of albums, most of them purchased used. One of the beauties of owning a turntable is the ability to expand your music collection very inexpensively, across a wide variety of musical genres, by buying used records. I probably pay an average of only $3 per record. </p>
<p>To answer your question I consulted my friend Erik, who has even more records than I do. He confirmed that some new releases of old material are phenomenal and some are horrible. Plan on doing your due diligence before buying. </p>
<p>Questions like yours inspired me to create a new website devoted just to vinyl. Sound Advice Vinyl is located at <a href="http://">soundadvicevinyl.com</a> and features turntable, cartridge and accessory reviews, a glossary, tips on system setup and cleaning your records, with much more to come, including reviews. The other two topics I get the most questions about are speakers and headphones, so I launched Sound Advice Speakers (<a href="http://">soundadvicespeakers.com</a>) and Sound Advice Headphones (<a href="http://">soundadviceheadphones.com</a>), as well. The sites are small now, but they will be growing rapidly. Please check them out and help me make them better by sending your questions, suggestions and review requests.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>When I left my dog Harper with a pet sitter recently while I was at a conference, I didn’t have too many concerns. Harper is a cavalier King Charles spaniel, a breed that’s known for being friendly and outgoing. A cavalier’s motto is usually “Love the one you’re with.” </p>
<p>But when I called to find out how things were going, I received the surprising news that Harper was barking nonstop when she was left alone. She was fine if the pet sitter was there, but even pet sitters have to leave the house sometimes, and Harper was not pleased about being crated in her absence. </p>
<p>Dogs who break housetraining, chew destructively — especially at doors and windows — or bark or howl in distress when left alone aren’t necessarily being bad, according to the upcoming book “From Fearful to Fear Free” (scheduled for publication in April 2018). They may be suffering from separation anxiety. </p>
<p>“Besides being noisy or destructive, dogs with separation anxiety may drool excessively, pace, lick themselves incessantly, or refuse to eat or drink,” write co-authors Dr. Marty Becker, Dr. Lisa Radosta, Dr. Wailani Sung and Mikkel Becker. </p>
<p>Dogs can learn from an early age how to be comfortable when left alone. </p>
<p>We start by leaving our dogs crated for short periods, gradually increasing the amount of time we’re gone. They always get a treat when we leave so that our departure is a positive experience, and returns are low-key to encourage the dog to remain calm. </p>
<p>Although she still looks and acts like a puppy, Harper is 10 years old. Was her change in behavior due to advancing age, I wondered? Veterinary behaviorist Dr. Sung says that’s not necessarily the cause, noting that only a small percentage of the cases of separation anxiety she sees involve older animals. But separation anxiety can occur at any age and may be related to changes in the dog’s life. </p>
<p>“When the family or owner schedule gets disrupted, the animals have more difficulty adjusting, and sometimes they become gradually distressed over time,” she said. </p>
<p>For pets with mild cases of separation anxiety, Dr. Sung has some advice: </p>
<p>“Maintain the same schedule and routine,” she says. “Provide both physical and mental exercise through walks and food-dispensing puzzle toys.” </p>
<p>If your dog shows signs of severe anxiety, check with your vet to see if medicine or behavior modification under the guidance of an experienced trainer or a veterinary behaviorist can help. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>In 2017, Minneapolis was in the midst of a building boom that had two remarkable components: </p>
<p>• No one broke ground on a tall office tower that will remake the skyline. </p>
<p>• No one built anything that was big, pretentious and ugly. </p>
<p>Still, it’s been an interesting year in architecture, and if it seems a bit underwhelming, that’s not bad. There’s nothing wrong with substance over flash, more housing and fewer “starchitect” vanity projects. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the notable additions to the city. </p>
<h3>Target Center </h3>
<div> <div><!-- add .is-photo, .is-gallery, .is-graphic, .is-video -->

                <a href="http://stmedia.startribune.com/images/ows_151456595188881.jpg" title="265257323">

        <img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/circulars/images/blank.gif" style="height: 0px;position:absolute;">
    
    
  </div>

            <div style="text-align: right; font-size: 75%; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;">
        
      </div>
              <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">
                  365 Nicollet is a 30-story luxury residential and retail development near the Central Library.
              </div>
       </div>
<p></p>
<p>A fine upgrade. The exterior renovation made you realize that the original design looked like an enormous sullen mushroom. Opening up the corner with a glass-walled cutaway connects the building to the street, and vice versa. </p>
<h3>The Nicollet Mall </h3>
<p>Some people were underwhelmed with the remake of the mall, and wondered why it took so much time and money. The standard answer: Most of the work was utility work, done under the street. </p>
<p>As for the aboveground design, perhaps it shouldn’t be judged until spring. Unveiling a stark gray makeover in November was unfortunate timing, to say the least. It’ll look better when it’s greener. Then people may appreciate the elegant restraint of the overall design. </p>
<p>Another plus? It will wear well, at least until times change and people start to miss puce, purple and gray. </p>
<h3>365 Nicollet </h3>
<p>The 30-story residential tower is a welcome addition to Nicollet Mall, bringing density to a moribund block. The west-facing side has an irregular facade, avoiding the usual wall-of-identical-balconies favored by some developers. This gives it a certain cosmopolitan panache that almost makes up for the parking ramp on the lower floors. </p>
<p>(In some people’s ideal world, there would be no parking ramp. In a developer’s ideal world, people actually move into the buildings they construct. Hence the ramp.) </p>
<h3>Hennepin County Medical Center </h3>
<p>The new addition, which houses the specialty center, is orange. It’s orange and brown. It may bring back bad memories for anyone who got a shag rug burn in 1973, but the curved glass wall that wraps around the burnt-umber side of the structure gives it lift and sparkle. </p>
<p>The old HCMC is an awful beast; hospitals should not look like indifferent pain machines. The new addition doesn’t just provide relief, it’s a rebuke. </p>
<h3>Kraus-Anderson block </h3>
<p>It’s not finished, but you get the gist: There’s the 17-story HQ Apartment tower, a silver-white slab that rests on a brick base intended to echo the smaller, older residential structures in the neighborhood. </p>
<p>When a project takes up an entire block, it can suffer from a sameness that makes it look like a bunker dropped on a parking lot. Some developers stick different facades on the building to make it look as if one building is several individual buildings. (No one believes this.) </p>
<p>Kraus-Anderson didn’t do that. Instead, the project breaks up the 5th Avenue side into three unconnected buildings of different height and styles, with a barnlike brewpub in the middle. It’s not a blindingly brilliant success and it’s not a regrettable failure. It needs something across the street (now the Normandy Inn parking lot) to give the site some visual compression. Right now, it looks like one of those new developments on the edge of town. </p>
<p>The brewpub is the most interesting structure. It’s different, and we don’t mean that in disapproving Minnesota-auntie kind of way. Come summer, the area behind the pub — an outdoor patio in the cool shadow of the HQ — might be one of the best spots downtown. </p>
<p>That said, the Kraus-Anderson five-story headquarters could have been built in the suburbs in 1986. </p>
<h3>NordHaus </h3>
<p>It’s an apartment complex on the Superior Plating site in northeast Minneapolis, formerly a blighted industrial plot. But now there’s a housing project with two distinct elements. There’s the low, stark featureless block of flats that lives up to the “Scandinavian Themed” description. You suspect it was not built by ordinary means, but assembled from an enormous box that said Ikea on the side. This is not a criticism: It’s clean, rational and cool. </p>
<p>The development, at 315 1st Av. NE., wouldn’t make any year-end lists, if not for the 20-story tower next to it. It’s unlike most other recently built towers in that it’s not entirely square. One corner has a big wide curve that makes it look more Floridian than Scandinavian. It makes anyone on the street wonder what the view must be like at sunset. </p>
<h3>The build goes on </h3>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.mplsbuild.com/">Big Build website (mplsbuild.com)</a>, four consecutive years of $1 billion in construction permits are transforming the city of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The site, which is sponsored by the Minneapolis Downtown Council, the Minneapolis Downtown Improvement District and Meet Minneapolis, ensures us that ours will become “an elite 21st Century City.” </p>
<p>When it’s done, the IDS will still be the tallest building in town. A gorgeous, timeless, skyline-redefining tower isn’t on the drawing board yet. For all the new additions, Minneapolis is still the city you know. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Authorities have charged a 33-year-old man suspected of robbing the same Minneapolis convenience store five times in two months. </p>
<p>Jamye Davis was arrested during his latest heist Dec. 23, after a store clerk signaled officers, who had been watching the 8th Street Market, at 630 SE. 8th St., according to police. The store is less than a mile from Davis’ home in northeast Minneapolis. </p>
<p>As in the previous robberies, which dated to Nov. 19, Davis was captured on surveillance video entering the store and demanding cash, while threatening the cashier with a gun, according to court filings. </p>
<p>In the Dec. 23 robbery, the suspect grabbed the till and ran from the store, the filings said. After a brief foot chase, officers caught up to Davis at a nearby apartment complex and arrested him, the court records show. As he fled, Davis shed his coat, beanie hat and bandanna, said police, who also recovered the till and a black Smith &amp; Wesson airsoft gun. </p>
<p>Davis is being held at the Hennepin County jail in lieu of $75,000 bond. He faces five separate counts of first-degree aggravated robbery. </p>
<p>Police said that Davis admitted to the robberies after being arrested, telling investigators that he had used a fake gun each time — coloring the gun’s plastic orange tip to make it look real, he said — and then would take the bus downtown to buy heroin. </p>
<p>The incidents occurred Nov. 19, and Dec. 10, 18, 21 and 23. Each time, he wore a blue coat or sweatshirt, a beanie hat and a bandanna over his face, police said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and two other entities that sued the city of Minneapolis last month over the plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 have now pulled out of the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The chamber initially <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-chamber-of-commerce-sues-minneapolis-over-15-minimum-wage/456662053/">filed the lawsuit in November</a>, asking for a temporary injunction to stop the minimum wage from going into effect.</p>
<p>But the chamber withdrew its involvement on Thursday, along with the TwinWest Chamber of Commerce and the Minnesota Recruiting &amp; Staffing Association. Only the northeast Minneapolis-based Graco Inc. remains in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>“The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce has decided not to pursue further legal action against the City of Minneapolis regarding its minimum wage ordinance,” the chamber said in a statement. “Although the court’s initial decision in this case created obstacles to this particular legal challenge, we believe a correct reading of the law would conclude that the ordinance remains unlawful by conflicting with state law.” </p>
<p>Chamber officials said they intend to continue pushing for uniform labor standards at the Legislature and, if necessary, in the courts, “so that businesses spend less time complying with laws and more time innovating and creating jobs.” </p>
<p>Graco spokesperson Charlotte Boyd said the company intends to continue the litigation “to preserve a flexible work environment and a vibrant business community in this state.” </p>
<p>“A city mandating a minimum wage is a slippery slope; if this stands, then we have no ability to predict what the next mandate will be. Businesses cannot make informed long-term investment decisions in an uncertain environment,” she said. </p>
<p>Minnesota Recruiting and Staffing officials said that despite ceasing their involvement, they believe the courts “will ultimately find that the City of Minneapolis minimum wage ordinance is pre-empted by existing state statutes.” Representatives from the Twin West Chamber could not be immediately reached for comment. </p>
<p>Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal said with Graco still in the lawsuit, the case will proceed. “We will continue to defend the validity of the minimum wage ordinance,” she said. </p>
<p>Minneapolis became the first Midwestern city to adopt a $15 minimum wage in June, when the City Council approved an ordinance that phases in the wage hike over several years. Other cities across the country, including Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., have also adopted a $15 minimum wage, and St. Paul leaders are considering doing the same. </p>
<p>The chamber and other members of the business community fought Minneapolis’ minimum wage ordinance when it was being developed and lamented its approval this summer. The argument at the time, which the chamber reiterated in its lawsuit, was that having minimum wage laws that vary by city would be burdensome for employers. </p>
<p>Minnesota’s hourly minimum wage is $9.50 for large employers — those with annual gross revenue of $500,000 a year or more — and $7.75 for small employers. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-minimum-wage-set-to-rise-with-inflation-in-2018/440945833/">Those rates will rise with inflation in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Minneapolis ordinance, large businesses — those with 100 or more employees — must phase in the $15 minimum wage by July 1, 2022. Small businesses have until July 1, 2024. </p>

<p><span>MILWAUKEE </span>– Been there and done that.</p>
<p>Timberwolves reserve point guard Tyus Jones will be moving back into a starter’s role for the second time this season. </p>
<p>In November, he started four games when starter Jeff Teague experienced soreness in his heel. </p>
<p>Now here in December, Jones moves back alongside Jimmy Butler and the other starters probably for at least the next two weeks while Teague heals from a strained MCL knee ligament sustained late in Wednesday’s overtime victory over Denver. </p>
<p>Jones calls himself “comfortable” over such a development. </p>
<p>“Just because it’s not the first time now,” he said. “It’s something I’ve done, something we’ve gone through as a team. I’m just ready to go. My first-time experience, I learned it was still just basketball. You’re in the game to start rather than coming in a few minutes into the game, but it’s just basketball at the end of the day.” </p>

                  Tyus Jones got past Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks on Thursday.

<p>The difference: In an instant, he goes from playing between 10 and 16 minutes a night to more likely around 40 against Indiana. </p>
<p>On Thursday against Milwaukee, he played 35 minutes and left for nearly 2½ minutes late in the game while he returned to the locker room to get a dislocated left pinkie finger put back in place. Third-string point guard Aaron Brooks played 3½ minutes in the second quarter and then not again after he was unavailable for Wednesday’s game because he was ill. </p>
<p>“The biggest difference is physical, just playing more minutes,” Jones said. “The first time, I was a little more sore the next morning. The more minutes you play, the more you get used to it.” </p>
<p>Jones’ dislocated finger was one of what Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau called “moving parts” partly responsible for a 102-96 loss that came after the Wolves led by 20 points in the third quarter. </p>
<p>Andrew Wiggins’ sprained ankle sustained midway through the third quarter — he returned late in the quarter and played the entire fourth quarter — was another on a night when the Bucks erased the Wolves’ 74-54 lead with a 36-16 run and a lopsided 27-12 fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Thibodeau brought in veteran guard Jamal Crawford when Jones came to the bench clutching his left hand with five minutes left and the score tied at 90. The Wolves trailed by two points when Jones returned to the game with 2:25 left. </p>
<p>The Bucks scored the next seven points for a 102-93 lead before Butler made a three-point heave at the buzzer. </p>
<p>“It’s the first time it has ever happened to me,” Jones said after the game, his pinkie finger wrapped in ice. “They put it back in place. I’ll be all right. It’s tough when you’re a competitor. You don’t want to leave the court, especially at that part of the game. But I was able to get back out there. I’ll be all right.” </p>
<p>Thibodeau paired Butler and Crawford together frequently Thursday, often with Butler handling the ball and Crawford, as well as Jones, playing off the ball. </p>
<p>“We ask Jimmy to do a lot, and he does a lot for this team,” Jones said. “We do need to help out a little bit more. We’re going to follow his lead. He’s the leader of this team, and we’re going to follow his lead. He wants the ball in crunch time, and he’s proven why we continue to go to him.” </p>
<p>Afterward, Thibodeau second-guessed himself for not involving Butler — the team’s fourth-quarter difference throughout a five-game winning streak that ended Thursday — more. </p>
<p>“We probably should have the ball in his hands,” said Thibodeau, whose team played its third game in four nights and consecutively after winning in overtime the night before. “Part of it is I didn’t know where we were with Tyus. Usually you can fix those things on the bench. They couldn’t get that straightened out. I didn’t know if he was coming back or not. There was a lot of stuff going on there.” </p>
<p>The Wolves called Teague out “indefinitely” after an MRI done Thursday morning revealed a Grade 1 MCL sprain, the mildest of three grade levels. Golden State’s Stephen Curry was diagnosed with the same injury in the 2016 playoffs and missed about two weeks. </p>
<p>Thibodeau said the Wolves will respond with Jones starting and playing more but also with the ball in Butler’s hands more. </p>
<p>“The challenge will be defensively,” Thibodeau said when asked about Jones’ return to starter. “You’re going against starters. You don’t replace a guy like Jeff with one guy. You have to do it with your team. Everybody is different. Tyus has different strengths than Jeff, and Jeff is one of the best point guards in the league. You’re not going to replace him with one guy.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Summit Brewing Co., one of the first major players in the craft beer phenomenon, finds itself a victim of the industry’s success. </p>
<p>Faced with slowing production and growing competition in a new taproom-driven world of hip and hazy pale ales, the St. Paul brewer laid off about a dozen people just after Christmas, or about 10 percent of its staff. </p>
<p>The cuts are a first for the 32-year-old company, making for a difficult week at the West End-area brewery. </p>
<p>“More important than the numbers, these are great, talented people,” Brendan Kennealy, a company spokesman, said Friday. “Anytime you lose one good person it hurts. These moves affected every department.” </p>
<p>Through the recent rise of craft beer taprooms made possible by the so-called “Surly bill,” Summit has been a reliable producer of 100,000-plus barrels a year and a mainstay in the tap lineups of local barrooms. Sweeney’s Saloon in St. Paul, for one, has shined a light on Summit with its happy hour specials. </p>
<p>“It’s a bummer. It’s sad,” said Joseph Alton, editor of The Growler magazine, which has been covering the local brewing industry for about five years. “St. Paul is an intimate town, and craft beer is an intimate industry.” </p>
<p>Still, no one, in Alton’s view, should look at the layoffs as a warning sign of Summit’s demise. “They are just having a hard time finding their identity in the new era of craft beer in Minnesota,” he said. </p>
<h3>Production down </h3>
<p>When home-brewer Mark Stutrud started the company in 1986, Summit was the first newcomer in decades on St. Paul’s beer scene — and one of the first microbreweries in the nation. </p>
<p>The city at the time also was home to large breweries that produced Stroh’s and Schmidt beers. </p>
<p>Today, several dozen microbreweries operate in the Twin Cities, and nearly 150 statewide. Summit has grown to be the second-largest beer producer in Minnesota after New Ulm-based August Schell Brewing Co., outproducing the next-biggest brewer in the Twin Cities, Surly Brewing Co., by about 40,000 barrels annually. </p>
<p>But the brewery, situated on a hill above Shepard Road and the Mississippi River, will finish this year with an output of about 115,000 barrels, down 11 percent from a year ago. </p>
<p>That was despite a brewing capacity of 180,000 barrels a year, and staffing geared to that level of production. </p>
<p>Seven months ago, Summit halted distribution in six eastern states where sales were low. The brewer now concentrates on Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Dakotas and Iowa. The company also announced plans to remodel its taproom and patio in an effort to attract more customers. Initially, the room was more of an event space. </p>
<p>Stutrud was not available for comment on Friday. But in a conversation this week with Alton, he spoke of the craft beer culture changing to more of a taproom experience. Those rooms have grown more common, and increasingly spacious, in recent years after Surly spurred a change in state law in 2011 that allows breweries to also sell their products out of taprooms. Stutrud was “definitely kind of handicapped” by the success of on-site options, Alton said. </p>
<h3>Still a quality brewer </h3>
<p>For years, Alton said, he has rolled his eyes when people ask if craft breweries have hit a saturation point. But Summit’s recalibration, he said, could be a harbinger. </p>
<p>“We could be seeing the end of the fastest growth [rate] that craft beer will ever have,” he said. </p>
<p>Summit’s quality certainly is not an issue, he said. Its Oatmeal Stout is “one of the best beers of all time,” Alton said. </p>
<p>But the brewer, to a certain degree, “is a victim of this fervor for what’s new and what’s hot — even if it’s not the best,” he said. </p>
<p>In his conversation with Stutrud, the owner predicted a return to growth, and Alton is not counting him out. </p>
<p>“He is a pretty gregarious guy, but he convinced me with his optimism,” he said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A Subway sandwich is far more than the sum of its fillings, franchisee Keith Miller believes. </p>
<p>Those ingredients cost roughly $2. Then he pays labor. Electricity. Gas. Royalties. Credit card transaction fees. Rent. </p>
<p>All told, Miller, who owns three Subway franchises in Northern California, said it costs him well more than $4 to produce one of Subway’s foot-long subs. And that is why, when the chain announced plans to drop the price of the sandwich to $4.99 starting in January, he and hundreds of Subway’s other 10,000 U.S. franchisees sent a strongly worded letter warning that the promotion could force some stores to close. </p>
<p>“The numbers don’t work for us,” said Miller, who also chairs an industry group, the Coalition of Franchisee Associations. “Ten years ago, they might have worked. But now they don’t, in my opinion.” </p>
<p>As fast-food chains across the country have slashed menu prices to revive flagging sales, a rift has emerged between some name-brand corporations and the local operators who run their outlets. </p>
<p>For years now, the retail industry has been shaken by giant companies that have been able to keep prices low, wooing consumers but squeezing suppliers and smaller competitors. But in the restaurant business, the push to keep prices low has pitted corporate headquarters against individual outlet owners — all operating under the same brand. </p>

<p>Corporations need to grow systemwide revenue to please board members and shareholders. But small-scale franchisees, who face rising costs and increased local competition, are far more concerned with store-level profits. </p>
<p>In addition to Subway’s plans to relaunch the “$5 Footlong,” McDonald’s will revive a version of its Dollar Menu next month. Taco Bell has promised to expand its selection of discount items, as have Wendy’s and Jack in the Box. </p>
<p>“This is an inherent financial conflict between franchisees and franchisers,” said J. Michael Dady, a lawyer at the Minneapolis firm Dady &amp; Gardner who represents franchisees in conflicts with their corporate parents. “And some have handled it much better than others have.” </p>
<p>To date, the uprising at Subway has been the most visible. </p>
<p>In late November, franchisees began circulating a petition that asked Subway to withdraw the foot-long deal, which they said would hurt their businesses. </p>
<p>Under the franchise system, chain restaurants such as Subway coordinate menus, product sourcing, store design and strategy across all locations. Local operators pay the chain to belong to that system. They also manage the day-to-day business of their stores — rent, labor, ingredients, utilities, maintenance and equipment — and draw their paychecks from whatever is left. </p>
<p>Discounts can cut dangerously deep into those margins, the petition says. </p>
<p>The document has been signed by nearly 900 people from 39 states who claim to own Subway franchises. Like Miller’s, many are small or family-run entities that operate only a handful of locations. </p>
<p>Such a public revolt is highly unusual, said John Gordon, the founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group, a restaurant-oriented firm based in San Diego. The closest precedent is a 2009 lawsuit filed by Burger King franchisees who claimed they were losing money on every sale of the chain’s $1 double cheeseburger. </p>
<p>In a statement, Subway said that the petition does not represent the views of the majority of its franchisees and that the promotion is optional. Business owners who opt out, however, may face disgruntled customers. </p>
<p>In a separate presentation to franchisees, Subway said the promotion was intended to help them stanch several years of falling traffic. </p>
<p>“We are in constant communication with our franchisees and development agents,” the company said in its statement. “They are actively involved in many aspects of our decisionmaking process, and we welcome and encourage their feedback.” </p>
<p>But many franchisees said that corporate attempts to grow sales have added to a growing list of challenges. </p>
<p>Miller said that when he bought his first Subway 28 years ago, his margins could swell as high as 18 percent. But since then, he said, competition has grown far more fierce and costs have risen dramatically for labor, utilities and rent. </p>
<p>Labor costs at fast-food restaurants have increased in each of the past three years, according to the financial-consulting firm BDO, the result of rising minimum wages and increased competition for employees. While the federal minimum wage has not risen since 2009, 29 states and the District of Columbia have instituted higher wages. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the restaurant market has grown more crowded. Between 2009 and 2014, the United States added nearly 18,000 fast-food restaurants, according to the Agriculture Department — growing at more than twice the rate of the population over the same period and continuing a decades-long trend. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, it’s not just quick-service restaurants competing for consumers’ dining dollars anymore. Fast-casual restaurants such as Panera, delivery services such as GrubHub and meal kits such as Blue Apron have all muscled their way into the market, as have grocery and convenience stores. </p>
<p>As a result, year-over-year sales at fast-food and fast-casual chains have fallen dramatically over the past two years, according to Technomic, a restaurant-analytics firm. And because name-brand chains report those numbers to investors, it has put them under enormous pressure to find ways to pull in more customers. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The Washington Post </p>
<p>As the daughter of a back-to-the-land homesteader and pot farmer, I learned never to speak of what my father did. We lived a simple life in times when only growing a few plants could sustain us. </p>
<p>“Say I am a retired schoolteacher,” he lectured. “You don’t want to have to come visit your daddy in jail, do you?” </p>
<p>It’s only recently that I can publicly tell stories from my childhood, of when my dad would pull me into the shade to hide from low-flying helicopters searching for cannabis patches across the hills of Mendocino County, California. </p>
<p>In 1976, he began supporting our family as a black-market grower, planting blackberry bushes and building platforms in the trees to shield his plants from the local marijuana eradication team. When my husband and I began growing, we used the same techniques, tunneling through the blackberries to keep our plants hidden. We now support our two kids, ages 17 and 10, in the market that took shape when California legalized medical marijuana two decades ago. </p>
<p>On Jan. 1, we can come into the sunlight as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act takes effect across California, legalizing recreational cannabis for adults 21 and older. Yet after waiting so long for the trophy of legalization, to finally be free in our lifestyle choice to live off the land, I can’t help but wonder: Will small farmers like me be wiped out by big business? </p>
<p>Yes, New Year’s will be a day of celebration for many, including tech billionaire Sean Parker, who helped bankroll the Proposition 64 campaign to end cannabis prohibition in the sixth-largest economy in the world. Recreational use is now legal in every state along the West Coast. With California poised to earn up to $1 billion in tax revenue, other states likely will follow our lead, which could spur calls for a change in federal law. </p>
<p>After Vietnam, many forward-thinking college graduates like my father, who’d had enough of the government and its wars, moved out to the mountains here. This was the baby-boomer generation - hippies, Deadheads and flower children who decided the mainstream way wasn’t working for them. They wanted freedom, peace and quiet. </p>
<p>My father bought a 40-acre piece of paradise for $5,000. He would build his own home and live on his own time, calmly raising his children off the money he made selling cannabis. When prices were $4,000 or more per pound, even the worst farmer could make a decent living off a few plants. </p>
<p>After harvest, my dad would take us to Baja California, Mexico, in the winter, where we would relax before returning to the mountains to start seeds and plant next year’s crop. While the farmers worked, we kids played in the forest and visited neighbors who were like family. </p>
<p>We knew that our secret lifestyle was unique and that it was also illegal and scary at times. We had to live a sort of undercover existence that our grandparents would cringe at if they knew their grandchildren lived barefoot and dirty, homeschooled and unruly in the hills, while our parents grew, trimmed and sold cannabis. </p>
<p>We never imagined that the biggest threat to our lifestyle could be legalization. But the new regulations allow unlimited growing licenses, which means venture capitalists will be able to create mega-cannabis corporations. The market is already flooded with cannabis from neighboring states. We’re about to see a tsunami hit California. </p>
<p>In rural Mendocino County, about 40 small farmers have banded together in a collective called Mendocino Generations to try to navigate the changes. As operations director, I field texts all day from anxious growers. They are already using credit cards to cover the costs of a bad harvest, wildfire damage and compliance with local and state cannabis regulations. Members hope buyers will favor our craft cannabis over the “Walmart weed” driving down prices. But we need help from the county and the state to get there. </p>
<p>Proposition 64 should not repeat the mistakes that have allowed big agriculture and timber companies to wipe out American farm families in the past. </p>
<p>California needs to support policies that help cannabis growers of all sizes. We need tax incentives for small producers, caps on cultivation size and value-added labels for sun-grown producers. </p>
<p>The advantages of entering the legal market are clear. I can now freely discuss the hardships and beauties of this industry in public. A year ago, I wouldn’t even print my last name or phone number on my business cards. My father is still skeptical about talking to the press. </p>
<p>This is an epic turning point, and we’re proud to be a part of it. My family’s work and the story of this region are intertwined. I just hope California doesn’t leave behind the small farmers who are the backbone of this community. </p>

The project stalled, but a new owner has received approval to bring out of bankruptcy. (LEILA NAVIDI/Star Tribune file photo)</div>
                                    </div>
<p>The former Essar Steel Minnesota project has emerged from bankruptcy court under the new ownership of Chippewa Capital Partners, company officials announced Friday. </p>
<p>Essar, which had been renamed Mesabi Metallics, officially exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan Dec. 22 after nearly a year and a half, according to records filed in Delaware, where the bankruptcy case was heard. </p>
<p>Virginia billionaire Tom Clarke, who is a Chippewa principal and Mesabi’s new CEO, praised the bankruptcy process and the efforts of Gov. Mark Dayton, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the Itasca County Board of Commissioners. </p>
<p>State and local officials worked closely with Mesabi and Chippewa to make sure the $1.9 billion project could be brought back to life under new ownership, Clarke said in a statement. Chippewa and its partners committed to investing another $500 million in the project through loans and equity payments and also promised to partly pay many contractors who were left unpaid when the former Essar ran into financial trouble. </p>
<p>Under Chippewa, the half-built plant in Nashwauk is expected to see construction completed in the next two years or so. It is expected to produce 7 million tons of iron ore pellets a year. Separately, a new advanced ore processing plant will be added on the same site. It will produce 2 million tons of hot briquette iron a year. </p>
<p>Chippewa Capital officials thanked Minnesota contractors for their patience and commitment to finish the multibillion-dollar ore project. Many contractors were left in the lurch for millions of dollars after the massive construction project mostly shuttered in 2015 after years of financing woes by the prior owner, based in Mumbai, India. </p>

<p>As a result of the bankruptcy restructuring plan, Chippewa Capital provided the funding for Mesabi to make deferred mechanic lien-holder payments last Friday. Those payments are now three years ahead of schedule, officials said in the statement. </p>
<h3>Dayton thanks company </h3>
<p>Dayton said in an e-mail that he thanks Chippewa Capital and specifically Clarke for expediting the critical lien-holder payments, which were another step that helped the long Essar drama move forward. </p>
<p>“The Nashwauk project’s emergence from bankruptcy is a very important step toward Chippewa Capital Partners’ stated goal of finishing construction on the former Essar plant, obtaining the necessary financing and operating agreements and beginning production, which will mean more jobs for the Range,” Dayton said. </p>
<p>Mesabi is working with an international team of experts including Kiewit Energy Group, Tenova and Danieli to complete the Nashwauk pellet plant and to build the briquette plant next door. </p>
<p>Clarke said the project has equity investors from three continents and believes prospective global pellet sales will revive the old Essar site and inject jobs and economic value into the once-dead project. The project is intended to provide “substantial employment and tax benefits to northern Minnesota” throughout the construction period and afterward, he said. </p>
<p>The former Magnetation ore assets in Grand Rapids that are owned by another Clarke affiliate, ERP Iron Ore (ERPI), will be integrated into the Mesabi operations in Nashwauk. They will provide an additional 3 million tons of ore that will eventually be pelletized at ERPI’s Metso plant in Indiana or sent to a production facility in Lorain, Ohio. </p>
<h3>Liquidation averted </h3>
<p>David Pauker, Mesabi’s chief restructuring officer throughout the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, said the bankruptcy raised “the very real prospect of liquidation” of the Nashwauk properties. </p>
<p>“Instead, on emergence from bankruptcy, contractors and others who worked on the project received 75 cents on the dollar and lenders received a notional recovery of 30 cents, including new bonds,” he said. </p>
<p>Barb Naramore, assistant commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), said Chippewa Capital still has a few steps to complete before the state will give the company the mineral lease rights associated with the Nashwauk mining property. </p>
<p>Chippewa has until May 2018 to present the state with a copy of the contract proving it has a buyer for the iron ore that will be mined from Nashwauk. Chippewa has until June 30, 2018, to present the state with evidence that it has indeed secured all of the financing needed to finish construction of the half-built ore pelletizing plant in Nashwauk. </p>
<p>“They are making progress but have more work to do,” said Naramore during a phone interview. </p>
<p>The fact that Mesabi Metallics has formally exited bankruptcy means that the control of the mineral lease rights for Nashwauk now transfers from the court back to the state’s DNR division, Naramore explained. </p>
<p>The DNR will maintain control of the leases until Chippewa fully complies with all its financing and contract obligations to the state. </p>
<p>Once Chippewa meets the conditions of its agreement, the state will reinstate the mineral leases so they are under Chippewa’s control, Dayton and Naramore said. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">The incident included health data, but no personal financial info.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Jackie Crosby</h4>
<p>Plymouth-based hearing aid company Miracle-Ear Inc. said Friday that 554 patient records tied to its Coon Rapids location were compromised in a security breach to its e-mail system. </p>
<p>The incident occurred Oct. 24, when “an unknown and unauthorized intruder” gained access to the e-mail account of an employee in the legal department of Miracle-Ear’s parent company, Amplifon, which handles accounts and administrative work. </p>
<p>The privacy breach was discovered the next morning. </p>
<p>Miracle-Ear officials said no Social Security numbers or financial information were exposed by the incident, which company spokeswoman Andi Ruth-Negrini described as the work of outside hackers. </p>
<p>The compromised e-mail account included a spreadsheet with “excerpts” of patient records from the Best Hearing branch in Coon Rapids. The spreadsheet contained names, addresses, birthdays, dates of hearing aid purchase, hearing test results and contact information. </p>
<p>The company sent letters on Tuesday to those affected. Asked why it took two months to alert their clients, Ruth-Negrini said the breach needed to be fully investigated to determine its scale and scope. She did not know whether law enforcement was involved. </p>
<p>“We understand that this situation may upset or pose an inconvenience to our customers and sincerely apologize and regret this occurrence,” Miracle-Ear officials said in a statement. </p>
<p>Federal law requires that businesses and vendors of personal health records provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. Specifically, notifications must be sent “without reasonable delay and in no case later than 60 days following the discovery of a breach.” </p>
<p>Miracle-Ear is one of the best-known hearing aid brands in the nation. It operates a network of franchised and corporate-owned retail stores at more than 1,400 U.S. locations. </p>
<p>Those with questions may contact Miracle-Ear by e-mail at CustomerCare@Miracle-Ear.com and at a dedicated toll-free line at 877-778-5416. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Sue Grafton, author of the best-selling “alphabet series” of mystery novels, has died in Santa Barbara. She was 77. </p>
<p>Grafton was surrounded by family, including husband Steven Humphrey, when she died Thursday after a two-year battle with cancer, her daughter, Jamie Clark, posted on the author’s website. </p>
<p>“Although we knew this was coming, it was unexpected and fast. She had been fine up until just a few days ago, and then things moved quickly,” the posting said. </p>
<p>Grafton began her “alphabet series” in 1982 with “A is for Alibi.” Her most recent book, “Y is for Yesterday,” was published in August. </p>
<p>“Many of you also know that she was adamant that her books would never be turned into movies or TV shows, and in that same vein, she would never allow a ghost writer to write in her name,” her daughter wrote. “Because of all of those things, and out of the deep abiding love and respect for our dear sweet Sue, as far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y.” </p>
<p>Humphrey said Grafton had been struggling to find an idea for “Z” while undergoing treatment for rare and usually fatal cancer of the appendix, which was discovered in a routine colonoscopy. </p>
<p>“Nothing’s been written,” he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. “There is no Z.” </p>
<p>He added with a laugh, “Nobody in this family will ever use the letter Z again.” </p>
<p>The fictional heroine of the series, Southern California private detective Kinsey Millhone, was Grafton’s alter ego, she told The Seattle Times earlier this year. </p>
<p>“I’m an introvert, so doing half of what Kinsey is beyond my poor capabilities,” Grafton said. “But it’s fun to get to live her life without penalty.” </p>
<p>Her husband agreed that Grafton was Kinsey. </p>
<p>“Yes, as Sue said, ‘We’re one spirit in two bodies, and she got the good one,’” Humphrey said. </p>
<p>While Grafton aged, her heroine didn’t quite as much. </p>
<p>“So when I started, she was 32, and I was 42. Now, she is 39, and I am 77. So there’s a little bit of injustice there, but she is single,” she told NPR in an interview earlier this year. “She’s been married twice. She has no kids, no pets, no house plants.” </p>
<p>She said she was looking forward to reaching the end of the alphabet with “Z is for Zero.” </p>
<p>Lisa Scottoline, author of legal thrillers, tweeted that she was sad to hear of Grafton’s passing. </p>
<p>“She forged a path for women in crime fiction, and all of us followed and adored her,” she said. </p>
<p>Crime writer Lawrence Block called Grafton a wonderful writer “graced with vision and integrity and a generous spirit.” </p>
<p>“That never-to-be-written Z book is the least of what we’ve just lost,” Block tweeted. </p>
<p>Grafton began writing at 18, and completed her first novel at 22. “A is for Alibi” was the eighth novel she wrote, and the third she had published. </p>
<p>On her blog, she said her ideas come from everywhere. </p>
<p>“I read newspapers, textbooks on crime. I talk to private investigators, police officers, jail administrators, doctors, lawyers, career criminals. Ideas are everywhere,” she said. </p>
<p>Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Grafton stayed tied to her roots, dividing her time between a home there and in California. </p>
<p>“The world has lost a great talent and prolific author in Sue Grafton — and in Louisville we have lost a citizen, friend, neighbor, a master gardener and hometown hero,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted. “Her legacy will live on through her words, which will entertain and thrill readers for generations to come.” </p>
<p>In addition to her husband and daughter Jamie Clark, she is survived by another daughter, Leslie Twine, and her son, Jay Schmidt. </p>
<p>Grafton’s remains will be cremated and the family will hold a private memorial Sunday. Memorials also will be held in Louisville and New York City. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Zach Parise was back at Wild practice on Dec. 15.</div>
                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Zach Parise</strong> hadn’t played in a real game since April 22. That’s 250 days away from hockey for the Wild’s highest-paid player.</p>
<p>Well, Thursday night, the winger was finally back on the ice, albeit with the American Hockey League’s Iowa Wild in Des Moines in a 6-3 loss to the Rockford IceHogs. Minus the five casual pickup games in Da Beauty League this past summer, that was Parise’s first real action since missing most of training camp and all of the season so far with an injury that led to microdiscectomy surgery in late October. </p>
<p>“It all comes back pretty quickly,” Parise said Friday after morning skate at Xcel Energy Center. “But there was a lot of excitement just to be back and get on the ice for warmups and just get in a game situation finally. I was really excited to do that and happy that it went really well. Keep making progress after that, but I really enjoyed it, and I thought it was a good step for me.” </p>
<p>Parise logged an assist on <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Luke Kunin’s</strong> goal in the first period, but Parise said it took him a bit to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>“I’d say it took a period, a period and a half. That first period was pretty tough,” Parise said. “Once you’ve got to make plays at top speed, you get tired pretty quickly because the endurance level isn’t there. That’s stuff I’ll have to work through and be patient and know that it’ll come. But take a little bit to knock the rust off. </p>
<p>“There wasn’t a lot of hitting in the game as it was, but I would say probably a little tentative,” Parise said of his start. “And then after that, started to touch the puck a little more and get involved a little more in the corners and things like that, and I thought it went well.” </p>
<p>Wild coach <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Bruce Boudreau </strong>said he felt Parise came back to the NHL team “feeling pretty good about himself.”</p>
<p>“He played 15 minutes plus, started out a little tentative, as you can expect anyone would. But as the game went on, he got better,” Boudreau said. “He got quicker. He got more involved. And by the end of the game, he was doing well. So I mean, for a first time a guy’s played in what? Since April? That’s pretty good.” </p>
<p>Parise said he hadn’t spoken with General Manager <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Chuck Fletcher </strong>yet about a game plan for his return. And while conditioning stints can last up to 14 days, Parise said he was unsure if he’d need to head back down to Iowa for another game or not.</p>
<p>But even if it was just for one night only, Parise said he had “a lot of fun.” Probably so did the more than 7,000 fans that attended, though dollar dog night might have been the bigger draw instead of the NHL star. </p>
<h3>Dubnyk’s return </h3>
<p>After seven games and two periods on the sidelines, <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> Devan Dubnyk</strong> will start in goal tonight against the Nashville Predators at Xcel Energy Center.</p>
<p>Dubnyk left after the first period of Dec. 12’s Calgary game when he felt a pop that led to his lower-body injury. He said he knew something was wrong right away but had never had an injury like that happen to him before, so he finished out the period so he wouldn’t have to put his goalie partner in the tough position of coming off the bench. </p>
<p>He eased back into his start, first skating again Dec. 21 before sitting on the bench as <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Alex Stalock’s</strong> backup Wednesday against Dallas. While Dubnyk said he still feels a little sore, and it will probably be like that for a while, he hasn’t experienced any “hesitation in movements on the ice” since Dec. 23.</p>
<p>The goalie said it was just one specific spot causing him pain, which in a way made recovery easier because it didn’t impact more than just that area. When he first skated again, he said he wasn’t sure if he would be able to manage the butterfly move so routine for his position, but the more he did it, the better he felt, and it improved from there. </p>
<p>“It hasn’t been that long, but it feels like a long time,” Dubnyk said. “Just got to try to keep my approach simple. It usually only takes a couple minutes to get back into feeling normal. I’ve just got to concentrate on a couple small things and get back into the flow.” </p>
<h3>Injury slowdown </h3>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Nino Niederreiter</strong>, who left the Dec. 22 game at the Florida Panthers with a foot or ankle injury, and Parise are both possibly returning next week. Boudreau said Niederreiter skated Friday and will continue to skate through the weekend.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating at the point when you look in August and say, ‘You know what? Things are looking pretty good.’ But then you might not get that team until January,” Boudreau said. “Hopefully in January when we get that team, we’ll look pretty good.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The Kateri Residence, a south Minneapolis home that has helped hundreds of American Indian women recover from drug and alcohol addiction, could soon be the target of a rescue operation after disclosing that it faces severe financial troubles. </p>
<p>The two-story home, which is run by St. Stephen’s Human Services, <a href="https://ststephensmpls.org/sites/default/files/kateri_program_announcement.pdf">announced plans this month</a> to close in July after 44 years in operation. It cited years of financial losses and shifts in government funding priorities. The decision alarmed members of the Indian community in the Twin Cities, who voiced concern over losing the 16-bed residence amid a deadly opioid crisis and an increase in people experiencing homelessness.</p>
<p>But a recent Facebook posting about Kateri’s closure caught the attention of Patina Park, executive director of the nonprofit Minnesota Indian Women’s Resource Center (MIWRC), a Minneapolis nonprofit that provides a range of housing, drug treatment and mental health programs for Indian women and their families. </p>
<p>Days before Christmas, Park and her agency expressed interest in taking over Kateri Residence and even expanding the facility’s programs to include more chemical dependency treatment. The offer, however, came with a significant caveat: The MIWRC would have to raise at least $500,000 by next spring to make much-needed structural repairs to the aging brick building at 2408 4th Av. S. </p>
<p>“This program is too important to disappear,” Park said. “Our entire population suffers when families can’t find stable housing or relapse because they see there’s no purpose. … It can’t go away. It won’t go away.” </p>
<p>The MIWRC is not the only agency interested in Kateri Residence. </p>
<p>Gail Dorfman, executive director of <a href="https://ststephensmpls.org/">St. Stephen’s</a>, said two tribal nations and four nonprofits have approached her organization to propose alternative uses for the facility since the closure announcement. A nonprofit housing developer is eyeing the property as a site for low-income housing. Another agency expressed interest in converting the building into a clinic for chemical dependency treatment, she said.</p>
<p>Dorfman said officials at St. Stephen’s are weighing all the proposals and expect to make a decision on the building’s future by the end of January or early February. </p>
<p>“Whatever the future use of the building is, our goal is to ensure that it continues to serve the Native American community,” she said. “We feel very strongly about that.” </p>
<h3>Fresh start </h3>
<p>Since its opening in 1972, the Kateri Residence has helped hundreds of young women find jobs, health care and support for recovering from drug addiction. The home was known for blending traditional treatment methods with a focus on Indian culture and spirituality through such practices as talking circles and community feasts. </p>
<p>Angelique Morgan, 27, a former resident at Kateri and a member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, said reports that the home might close were “devastating” to her and other women who have stayed at Kateri. </p>
<p>In July 2013, Morgan was pregnant and struggling with alcohol abuse when she was admitted to Kateri Residence. The staff, she said, immediately made her feel at ease and connected her with other Indian mothers who had overcome their addictions. The program also gave much-needed structure to her life. Each morning, residents gathered downstairs for prayers and daily “smudging,” an Indian practice of burning dried sage and directing the smoke over their bodies. </p>
<p>“They built trust by relating to us culturally in a very empathetic way,” she said. </p>
<p>Morgan lived at Kateri for nearly a year and credits the program with giving her the strength to stay sober and pursue a degree in human services at Minneapolis Community and Technical College, where she will graduate this May. </p>
<p>“I would not be where I am today were it not for Kateri,” said Morgan, whose daughter, Mayeli, is now 4. “Without this program, there is no hope for a lot of these women.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Minneapolis residents unloaded their concerns and hopes for the city on Mayor-elect Jacob Frey on Friday, raising an array of topics from housing to police relations. </p>
<p>Frey did not do much talking during what was billed as a “listening session” at Horn Tower public housing complex on 31st Street and Blaisdell Avenue. Speakers opined on everything from public housing security to the plans for Hennepin Avenue. Frey takes office on Tuesday. </p>
<p>“We’re ultimately going to help put this input into policy,” Frey said at the end of the event. “So this is where it all starts and you all are a part of it. Thank you.” </p>
<p>Maria Cisneros said the city should implement a municipal identification program. She said immigrants who do not have identification are afraid to call the police, or are unable to move out of substandard housing. </p>
<p>“We are taken advantage of because we don’t have an identification,” she said through an interpreter. City leaders <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-to-adopt-2018-budget-wednesday-evening/462330673/">have asked staff</a> to study the issue and report back by March.</p>
<p>Police reform activist Dave Bicking decried the lack of public input in the city’s agreement to host the Super Bowl, as well as participation in a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/countering-violent-extremism-program-divides-communities-perpetuates-islamophobia/413648443/">controversial</a> federal program that targets the state’s Somali community with initiatives to combat violent extremism.</p>

<p>“This kind of stuff going on behind our backs has got to stop,” Bicking said. “I want to see the new mayor make sure that when these kind of proposals come up, that the city, the city government, and the people be involved.” </p>
<p>Fadumo Kassim wanted to ensure that the public housing complex had ample security staff around the clock. A security guard at Horn Tower <a href="http://www.startribune.com/victim-in-south-side-homicide-identified-as-area-security-guard/334780371/">was murdered</a> two years ago.</p>
<p>“We have a security problem here in Minneapolis, especially [on] Blaisdell Avenue,” Kassim said. </p>
<p>Security was also on the mind of Sarah Kuhnen, who said the city should commit more money to police wellness and de-escalation training. Kuhnen was a neighbor of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who was shot and killed by police this July after reporting an assault, and is a member of the group Justice for Justine. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman still has not decided whether to charge the officer who shot Damond. </p>
<p>“[Police] experience trauma on a daily basis and we want them supported better with wellness training that doesn’t just happen once — that happens annually and semiannually — along with de-escalation training,” Kuhnen said. </p>
<p>Adam Borgen, executive director of the Warehouse District Business Association, said the city should consider a “tip credit” — counting tips as part of an overall wage — in its implementation of a phased-in $15 minimum wage. He said this would expedite improved wages for back-of-the-house restaurant workers. </p>
<p>“I feel with a tip credit, the restaurant owners would be able to budget their money and be able to pay the back-of-the-house workers a higher wage at a faster rate,” Borgen said. </p>
<p>Friday’s session was overseen by the people heading Frey’s policy committee, Council Member Elizabeth Glidden and Abou Amara. Frey’s transition team has now held four such sessions. The new mayor plans to hold town halls in each ward of the city following his inauguration. </p>

<p>ST. PAUL, Minn. — A Republican state senator poised to become Minnesota’s next lieutenant governor says she’d run again for her Senate seat if she’s forced out of office. </p>
<p>Questions surround who will replace Lt. Gov. Tina Smith once she’s sworn into the U.S. Senate next week. The constitution says it should be current Senate president Michelle Fischbach, a Republican. </p>
<p>But Fischbach’s plan to retain her Senate seat has Democrats promising a lawsuit seeking to force her out of office. That could put control of the Senate up for grabs. Republicans hold a 34-33 majority. </p>
<p>Fischbach told KSTP-TV Thursday she’d run for her Senate seat in a special election if she’s removed by court order. She says she’d then resign as Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton’s lieutenant governor. </p>

<p>The current Vikings defense is on the verge of an accomplishment only <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Bud Grant’s</strong> “Purple People Eaters” have brought to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Ranked No. 1 on defense in both yards (280.9) and points (16.1) allowed per game heading into Sunday’s regular season finale against the Bears, these Vikings would be the franchise’s first to end a season atop both NFL’s defensive rankings since 1970. </p>
<p>Nose tackle <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Linval Joseph</strong>, and likely most of his defensive teammates, aren’t too interested in any talk short of the Vikings’ first Super Bowl championship.</p>
<p>“Not really,” Joseph said. “I’m just worried about team ball, and I think that makes everything so much better. I’m not worried about stats.” </p>
<p>Vikings coach <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Mike Zimmer</strong> said the significance is in the team’s play heading into the postseason, which is strong after the Vikings forced their first shutout since 1993 last weekend in Green Bay and gave up just seven points the week before against Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Veteran cornerback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Terence Newman</strong>, who was on the Zimmer-coached Cowboys defense that ranked No. 1 in 2003, said the ranking means little on its own. Dallas lost 29-10 in Carolina during that season’s opening wild-card weekend.</p>

<p>“Number one is cool, but if you don’t win what does it matter?” Newman asked rhetorically. “You can finish with the number one defense and go home in the first round of the playoffs.” </p>
<p>The Vikings haven’t allowed the fewest yards in a season since 1993 or the fewest points in a season since 1971. </p>
<p>“If you do something with it,” Newman said, “OK, then you’ve got something to talk about.” </p>
<h3>Elflein, Stephen out </h3>
<p>The Vikings will start a third different center Sunday against the Bears. Starter <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Pat Elflein</strong> will miss his second game this season because of a lingering shoulder injury.</p>
<p>Elflein was held out of practice all week and, if the Vikings lock up a first-round bye, could have three weeks off between games. The rookie’s left shoulder injury first popped up after the Dec. 3 win in Atlanta. </p>
<p>Right guard <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Joe Berger</strong> is expected slide over to start at center, opening up the possibility of right tackle <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Mike Remmers</strong> shifting inside to guard and <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Rashod Hill</strong> starting at right tackle. <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jeremiah Sirles</strong> already is replacing left guard <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Nick Easton</strong>, who broke his ankle in Green Bay.</p>
<p>“All those guys are pretty versatile,” Zimmer said. “So we’ll see.” </p>
<p>The Vikings also will be without defensive tackle <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Shamar Stephen</strong> (ankle), long snapper <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kevin McDermott</strong> (shoulder) and cornerback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tramaine Brock</strong> (foot). Rookie defensive tackle <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jaleel Johnson</strong> is in line for some playing time.</p>
<h3>Money on the line </h3>
<p>A handful of Vikings have incentives on the line Sunday, led by running back <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Latavius Murray</strong>, who can earn a $500,000 incentive and unlock a $500,000 salary escalator for 2018 by rushing for 169 yards against the Bears to give him 900 yards on the season.</p>
<p>Quarterback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Case Keenum</strong> will earn another $250,000 by starting Sunday, likely ensuring he’ll play 85 percent or more of the Vikings snaps this season. He has played 90.4 percent of the snaps so far.</p>
<p>Receiver <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Adam Thielen</strong> can increase his 2018 salary escalator by another $250,000 with five catches to reach 90 for the season. He’s already earned an additional $750,000 for next season by reaching 80 catches.</p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Hundreds of people lined up to prepay their 2018 property taxes Thursday at Clarkstown Town Hall in New City, N.Y. There’s confusion in some communities about early payments.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>New guidance from the Internal Revenue Service that limits taxpayers’ ability to deduct prepaid property levies on their 2017 tax returns is causing confusion nationwide as people rush to pay in advance without knowing whether they’re wasting their time and money. </p>
<p>The IRS said this week that taxpayers can deduct prepaid state and local property taxes for 2018 on 2017 returns only if the taxes were assessed before 2018. The guidance — which doesn’t define the term “assessed” — had local tax officials scratching their heads. </p>
<p>Some see the issue as an early signal of far wider confusion that’s coming soon — the predictable result of passing a bill that rewrites the tax code just two weeks before many of the changes take hold. </p>
<p>“This is the tip of the iceberg as state and local governments try to figure this out — and by the way, they’re trying to figure it out with one week before the changes take effect,” said Richard Auxier, a researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a public policy group. “And that week happens to be the week between Christmas and New Year’s.” </p>
<p>The IRS guidance comes after many state and local officials — including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — have taken pains to clear the way for their residents to accelerate property-tax payments. The nationwide flurry came ahead of the new tax law that will cap property tax deductions — along with those for state and local income taxes or sales taxes — at an overall total of $10,000. </p>
<p>For people in high-tax states, that spurred a rush to try to prepay for 2018 — or even beyond — to use the deduction on this year’s taxes, before the cap. But in practical terms, the new IRS guidance creates a patchwork of answers about whether the strategy makes sense: It depends on where you live. </p>
<p>It also depends on whether you pay the alternative minimum tax — a federal levy that runs parallel to the income tax and is designed to prevent taxpayers from reducing tax bills too much. The AMT — which affects many with six-figure incomes — can be triggered by a large increase in itemized deductions, and it can render those deductions useless in terms of cutting taxes. </p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important for people to talk to their tax adviser,” said Nicole Kaeding, an economist with the Center for State Tax Policy at the Washington-based Tax Foundation. Beyond that, she noted that local governments across the country can have widely different schedules for issuing property tax bills. </p>
<p>“In many local areas, property taxes do cross calendar years,” she said. So in deciding whether to make advanced payments, tread carefully. </p>
<p>In New York City, where the property tax fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30, people can pay their tax bills for the third and fourth quarters — that is, through next June — ahead of time, according to the city’s Department of Finance. The department is instructing people to consult their tax advisers. </p>
<p>The city’s tax roll for the 2018-2019 tax year won’t be completed until May, so property tax bills for July 2018 through December 2018 won’t be determined until June. </p>
<p>In New Jersey, where Christie ordered municipalities to accept prepayments of 2018 property tax bills, the IRS guidance doesn’t offer clarity. It says: “State or local law determines whether and when a property tax is assessed, which is generally when the taxpayer becomes liable for the property tax imposed.” </p>
<p>By state law, a New Jersey property assessor “shall determine his taxable valuations of real property as of October 1 in each year” — language that sounds promising for would-be tax cutters. But the same statute holds that the assessor “shall complete the preparation of his assessment list by January 10.” Ultimately, the “final assessment” is to be completed by May 5. </p>
<p>The IRS guidance suggests that what’s important is when “you’re being billed for the property taxes,” Kaeding said. </p>
<p>Towns on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” of hedge fund managers and Wall Street executives have also rushed to tell residents what they can and can’t pay. But in many instances, confusion reigns. </p>
<p>Some Connecticut towns collect property taxes in advance; others in arrears. In New Canaan, a recorded message on the town tax collector’s office line says “you can pay the second half of the July 2017 taxes in December 2017, which would normally be paid in January” 2018. It adds that “we do not have a warrant to collect the taxes for July 2018, and therefore it becomes illegal to accept any additional funds.” </p>
<p>The message is the same in Greenwich, where the average home price is almost $1.75 million. But in Stamford, homeowners could be surprised. </p>
<p>The town posted on its website on Dec. 21 that it “will accept early payments for property taxes,” but added that city officials won’t “provide any assurance or opinion that the IRS will allow these payments to be deductible on federal income taxes for the calendar year ending on December 31, 2017.” </p>
<p>Stamford said it would “credit” advance payments to future tax bills, but added that it “does not refund any portion of early tax payments.” </p>
<p>Taxpayers in Washington, D.C., may have a clearer path. The city’s Office of Tax and Revenue reviewed the IRS guidance and determined that “taxpayers prepaying their 2018 tax bills in 2017 can deduct the tax payments on their tax return,” according to a statement released by the city. </p>
<p>That’s because the city assessed property taxes for the 2018 fiscal year on Oct. 1. </p>
<p>But in nearby Arlington County, Va., 2018 rates won’t be set until April — meaning residents probably won’t get an enhanced deduction. </p>
<p>“We have never encouraged people to prepay their property taxes,” said Carla de la Pava, Arlington County’s treasurer. The county does accept tax payments head of time, as Virginia law requires, and she said that since Dec. 1, it has collected $11 million in prepayments, far more than usual. </p>
<p>In Montgomery County, Md., where the county council broke its December recess on the day after Christmas to meet and adopt a local law allowing prepayment, the effort appears to have been a waste of time. The county’s assessments for 2018 will be made in July. </p>
<p>“The county continues to advise taxpayers to consult their own tax adviser about the tax consequences of making a prepayment,” it said. </p>
<p>It’s not clear how many people in Montgomery County tried to take advantage of the prepayment — but it is clear that they’ll have to wait for any refunds. The county’s statement says, “there can be no refunds until there is a 2018 tax bill for your account.” </p>
<p>In California, local tax officials in Los Angeles and San Francisco are telling residents that they cannot prepay their 2018-2019 property taxes this month — the bills against which those prepayments would be credited won’t even be generated until September. </p>
<p>In Texas, where counties don’t official assess property taxes until next October, Dallas residents have besieged the tax assessor’s office with questions. “We are being careful not to advise people about the possible benefits,” said Dallas County Deputy Chief Tax Assessor Paul Hamilton. “We don’t know what it means.” </p>

<p>Early Thursday afternoon, as temperatures hovered in the single digits, a food truck distributed free sandwiches and salads to a steady stream of homeless folks in downtown St. Paul. The fare hailed from an unusual source: the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. </p>
<p>The ready-to-eat meals were originally intended for airline travelers, who would normally nibble on the upscale eats en route to their destination. But after sitting unsold for up to 24 hours at more than two dozen outlets at MSP, the still-fresh meals were later redistributed to a hungry and grateful crowd on the capital city’s frigid streets. </p>
<p>It’s a routine that’s repeated three times a week, and it prevents the food from otherwise ending up in a landfill. </p>
<p>Launched in late summer, the program pairs the Minneapolis-based nonprofit <a href="http://www.loavesandfishesmn.org/index.html">Loaves and Fishes </a>with <a href="https://www.hmshost.com/community/detail/sustainability-and-startsomewhere-initiative">HMSHost</a>, which operates the Minnesota Wild Bar and Restaurant, O’Gara’s Bar and Grill, MSP-MKT grab-and-go outlets, Starbucks coffee shops, and other eateries at the airport.</p>
<p>Personnel at Loaves and Fishes pick up the packaged meals and pass them out to those in need throughout the Twin Cities through a variety of channels, including the popular street outreach food truck. </p>
<p>“I love that it’s fresh food and it’s not being wasted,” said Cathy Maes, executive director of Loaves and Fishes. </p>

Most came by foot, many of them from <a href="https://www.cctwincities.org/locations/dorothy-day-center/"> Mary Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.cctwincities.org/locations/higher-ground-saint-paul/">Higher Ground St. Paul</a>, part of the Catholic Charities’ Dorothy Day complex nearby that provides services for the homeless and housing for the needy. One woman arrived swathed in a mint-green blanket that appeared to serve as a coat.</p>
<p>“This helps me get through the next couple of weeks,” said Clyde Bolden, who recently secured a room at the Dorothy Day complex. Another woman declared: “I love the Caesar salads!” </p>
<p>“Who wants a ham and cheese?” said Maes, who was helping staff the truck. “Do you want parfait with that? Vitamin water?” </p>
<p>Loaves and Fishes volunteer Vincent Vera said the frigid weather likely deterred some food recipients from showing up Thursday — during the summer 200 to 300 people usually line up for the meals. </p>
<p>“People are worrying, ‘Where’s my next meal?’ ” Vera said. “With the prepackaged meals, people can put them in their bags or their pockets. The need here is incredible.” </p>
<p>On Friday, Loaves and Fishes director of operations Kiley Benson was back at the airport loading dock beneath Terminal 1 commandeering a big white cargo van. He was met there by Butch Howard from HMSHost, who has helped spearhead the program on the airport side. </p>
<p>HMSHost operates restaurants at more than 120 airports worldwide, including 30 at MSP. It operates similar distribution programs at airports elsewhere, donating some 1.5 million pounds of food in the U.S. and Canada last year alone. </p>
<p>“You have to have a full stomach to do anything,” Howard said. “That’s why we do this. The food is going to all the right places.” </p>
<p>Friday’s load included the usual sandwiches and salads, which are prepared daily at the airport, a cache of almonds, a big bag of carrots, a box of pita bread and some frozen chicken filets. Sometimes restaurants at MSP donate leftover food in bulk, which Loaves and Fishes uses for hot meals served at sites throughout the seven-county metro area. </p>
<p>Loaves and Fishes also picks up excess food from cafeterias (before they hit the serving line) at Best Buy and Medtronic headquarters and at the University of Minnesota. All told, the organization expects to provide 750,000 meals to the needy this year, up from 570,000 meals in 2016. </p>
<p>Maes said the group’s increased capacity to serve its constituents, as well as a growing need, has fueled the demand. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.metroairports.org/Airport-Authority.aspx">Metropolitan Airports Commission </a> (MAC) spokeswoman Melissa Scovronski said she “would like to see the program grow and has been encouraging other concessionaires to participate. We have interest from a couple of them, but they haven’t had an opportunity to figure out the logistics for their particular operations as of yet.”</p>
<p>Other operators at MSP, including Delaware North, with three restaurants, and OTG, with eight, have recently signed on to the program, according to the MAC, which owns and operates MSP. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.foodwastealliance.org/">Food Waste Reduction Alliance</a>, the U.S. spends more than $162 billion growing, processing, and transporting food that is never eaten. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says more food reaches landfills than any other type of municipal solid waste.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I could spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week picking up food people don’t eat,” Benson said. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Marcus Fischer</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Marcus Fischer unexpectedly made his first appearance in court on Friday afternoon, nearly two weeks after he was shot by Minneapolis police officers when he brought a knife into an interview room and started stabbing himself. </p>
<p>Fischer, 18, appeared in a courtroom at the Hennepin County jail, standing behind a glass partition in a jail-issued orange jumpsuit, his right arm heavily bandaged. </p>
<p>His answers were brief when he was asked by Judge Gina Brandt about how he was feeling and whether he had any questions for her. The hearing took just a few minutes. </p>
<p>Fischer was discharged from Hennepin County Medical Center this week, where he was treated for injuries — both self-inflicted and when police shot him. Two previous court dates had to be <a href="http://www.startribune.com/marcus-fischer-s-court-date-pushed-back-to-jan-3-prosecutors-say/466831073/?section=local">rescheduled</a> because he was still undergoing medical treatment.</p>
<p>After his hearing Friday, Fischer turned and blew a kiss to family members and supporters, who for the third time since last week crammed the front two rows in the courtroom gallery. Several people, including his father, Eric, quietly sobbed as the teenager was led away. </p>
<p>Brandt set a bail hearing for Jan. 3, a date that prosecutors earlier this week had circled as his first court appearance. His case didn’t appear on the docket until Friday morning. </p>
<p>In the meantime, he is being held in the county jail, in lieu of $200,000 bail, on charges of first-degree assault, first-degree robbery and possession of a handgun by a prohibited person. </p>
<p>The senior at Menlo Park Academy was brought in Dec. 18 for questioning about his involvement in a robbery and shooting in northeast Minneapolis. Detectives left him unattended at one point during the interview and when they returned authorities say he was stabbing himself with a “large” folding knife that he had brought into the room in his waistband. </p>
<p>Officers tried to negotiate with Fischer, unsuccessfully using a Taser to subdue him, then opened fire when he ignored orders to put the weapon down and started moving toward the door. </p>
<p>The two officers who fired their guns — Sgt. Gene Suker and officer Jerome Carey — are on paid administrative leave pending an <a href="http://www.startribune.com/robbery-suspect-shot-by-minneapolis-police-to-make-first-court-appearance/465942403/">investigation by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension</a>. State investigators will turn their findings over to prosecutors from Washington County, which is handling the case because of a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The conflict arose from the fact that the Hennepin County attorney’s office has charged Fischer in the robbery case and also employs the father of officer David Martinson, who deployed the Taser. </p>
<p>Fischer’s co-defendant in the robbery case, Blaine Archambault, 35, is also being held at the jail. He is charged with aiding an offender and illegally possessing a firearm. </p>
<p>Attempts to reach attorneys representing the two defendants were unsuccessful on Friday afternoon. </p>

                                    </div>
<p></p>
<p>As the Vikings prepared for the Chicago Bears, there was a relaxed confidence around Winter Park this week — the kind that typically follows a team that knows what it wants and how to go get it. </p>
<p>The Vikings can clinch a first-round bye with a win at U.S. Bank Stadium, and the formula they’ll use to pursue their 13th victory of the season is the one they’ve honed on their way to 10 wins in their past 11 games. </p>
<p>In that time, Case Keenum has asserted himself as the team’s quarterback, capable of making downfield throws and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/case-keenum-s-legs-are-extending-plays-vikings-super-bowl-hopes/467040873/">using his feet to either extend plays or make them on his own</a>. Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon have formed a versatile backfield tandem, behind a deeper and nimbler offensive line than the Vikings had last year. The team has leaned on sublime route-runners Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs and a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/vikings-kyle-rudolph-is-a-red-zone-regular/465768103/">reliable red zone target in Kyle Rudolph</a>. Resourceful offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur has presided over the concoction, and on their roughest days, the Vikings could lean on the league’s top-ranked defense.</p>
<p>The formula has been blended over an 11-game stretch that dates to the Vikings’ first meeting with the Bears, on Oct. 9 at Soldier Field. That game, which now stands as the turning point of the Vikings’ season, also provides a reminder of how different things could have been. </p>
<p>A week before their Monday night game in Chicago, the Vikings fell to 2-2 with a 14-7 home loss to the Detroit Lions, losing rookie running back Dalvin Cook to a torn ACL in the process. Keenum lost for the second time in three starts against the Lions, completing 16 of his 30 passes for 219 yards and taking a costly sack that thwarted the Vikings’ comeback bid. </p>

              </div>
       </div>
<p></p>
<p>And rather than stick with Keenum in Chicago as they tried to avoid going 0-2 in the division, the Vikings opted to put their trust in Sam Bradford’s aching left knee, in a move that went haywire so quickly that the team took the rare step of <a href="http://www.startribune.com/vikings-head-trainer-says-belief-was-sam-bradford-could-not-protect-himself-and-was-pulled-from-bears-game/450310793/">making head athletic trainer Eric Sugarman available to the media the next day to explain the decision</a>.</p>
<p>The Vikings were up 3-2 in Chicago when they turned to Keenum just before halftime, and it was only when the offense began to coalesce around the quarterback that Minnesota avoided what could have been a costly loss. Keenum completed 17 of his 21 passes that night for 140 yards and a touchdown, and after Harrison Smith’s late interception of first-time starter Mitch Trubisky, Kai Forbath kicked a 26-yard field goal with 16 seconds left to give the Vikings a 20-17 win. A loss that night would have left the Vikings tied for third place in the division, before a home game against the 4-1 Packers. And it wasn’t lost on players or coaches this week how quickly things could have gone in a different direction had the Vikings lost the game. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I’d like to say no, but I think it’s reality that it [can],” Thielen said. “You lose a game, and it’s almost like you definitely lose momentum. When you can stack wins on top of each other, you just keep building confidence. Sometimes you feel like your offense is clicking extremely well, even though maybe it’s not. That just helps you moving forward because confidence is a huge thing in this league, and it can go a long way.” </p>
<p>Even in a locker room full of alpha males, the collective psyche of an NFL team can be a fragile thing. </p>
<p>“They all have confidence [as individuals], but I think as a team, they think, ‘Well, we’re not very good,’ or, ‘We’re really good.’ That has a lot to do with it,” coach Mike Zimmer said. </p>
<p>“Most teams don’t know if they’re good or bad at the beginning of the year. You come out, you win your first three games and you think you’re pretty good. You lose your first three games, you think you’re bad. It’s more about the team confidence than the individuals.” </p>
<p>Now, the Vikings are a win away from just the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/lucky-13-vikings-eye-more-than-milestone-win/466703313/">second 13-victory season in franchise history</a>. Keenum — the quarterback who clearly hadn’t established much equity with the Vikings by the time of the first Chicago game — figures to wind up on MVP ballots. He’s played himself into the increasingly complex conversation about the Vikings’ future at quarterback, as Teddy Bridgewater bides his time as Keenum’s backup and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sam-bradford-should-return-to-vikings-practice-next-week/466824033/">Bradford plans to return to practice</a> only next week.</p>
<p>An offense that leaned heavily on Cook during the first four weeks of the season has marched on without him, posting at least 100 rushing yards in all but one game since his injury and establishing the NFL’s eighth-best running game. </p>
<p>If the Vikings win Sunday, putting themselves two games from becoming the first team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium, there will be narratives proffered and platitudes breathed about the team’s grand plan, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-recruitment-of-case-keenum-how-the-vikings-keenum-partnership-materialized/450920953/">what it saw in free agents Keenum</a> and Murray that no one else did.</p>
<p>NFL seasons, in reality, are rarely so simple. The Vikings are probably where they are not so much because of a grand plan but because of a willingness to learn from previous years and give themselves options if injuries detour their preferred route. </p>
<p>The first Bears game — the moment when the Vikings offense found itself and the team’s run really started — is also a reminder of how quickly the season could have taken a darker turn. The second one could be a coronation. </p>
<p>And if this team goes on to play in, or even win, a Super Bowl in its home stadium, history might well remember a six-day stretch in October — between the victory at Soldier Field and the game where the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/vikings-knock-out-aaron-rodgers-packers-in-23-10-win/451002203/#1">Vikings felled Aaron Rodgers</a> — as the fulcrum of the whole season.</p>

<p>When her daughters were children, Khadija Athman packed the major Islamic holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha with celebration. </p>
<p>They opened gifts and covered their hands in henna. After prayer, they had breakfast at a pancake house before spending the day at the movies and Chuck E. Cheese’s. </p>
<p>“Eid is like our Christmas,” Athman said, her face brightening. </p>
<p>But for her daughters, the warm memories faded each time schoolmates in Prince William County, in suburban Northern Virginia, were awarded per­fect attendance certificates. The honor eluded Athman’s daughters, who were resentful because they missed school for the Muslim holidays, their mother said. </p>
<p>Muslim and Jewish students have long had to decide whether to observe a religious holiday or attend school. It’s a struggle facing diverse communities across the country as they seek to accommodate students from different religious backgrounds. </p>
<p>In some cases, students feel they are compelled to choose between faith and school. </p>

<p>“They don’t want to observe the holiday with their family because they don’t want to miss school,” said Meryl Paskow, a volunteer with the interfaith group Virginians Organized for Interfaith Community Engagement. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the interfaith group persuaded school leaders to be more forgiving of students who miss tests because of a religious holiday. The Fairfax and Prince William superintendents agreed to keep tests and major school events away from major Muslim and Jewish holidays, but school remains in session. </p>
<p>“I want them to be proud of their heritage,” Athman said. “You should be able to practice your religion without having to compete with school.” </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Minnesota schools </strong></h3>
<p>School districts elsewhere have made religious accommodations for decades. </p>
<p>In the Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts, absences for religious reasons are excused and don’t affect attendance records, according to school district staff. Principals work off calendars highlighting major religious holidays and are encouraged to remind teachers to avoid tests and key activities on those days. </p>
<p>“We remind principals of religious holidays each month through a monthly newsletter,” said Toya Stewart Downey, communications director at St. Paul Public Schools. “We ask them to be mindful of those dates when planning school events. </p>
<p>“We do our best,” she said. “But there are times when circumstances are unavoidable. … If they miss a test, students are allowed to make them up.” </p>
<p>In New York, schoolchildren have been given Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur off since the 1960s, said school district spokesman Michael Aciman. Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha were added in 2015. </p>
<p>In Paterson, N.J., schools close for only one holiday for each major religion. For example, students can take off for one of the Eid holidays, a decision the district makes in consultation with faith leaders. </p>
<p>In suburban Maryland, Montgomery County schools are closed on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. In 2015, students were given the day off on Eid al-Adha. About the same time, Howard County Public Schools in Maryland added days off on Eid ­al-Adha, the eve of Lunar New Year and the Hindu holiday of Diwali. </p>
<p>“These are great students,” said Rabbi Michael G. Holzman, of the Northern Virginia Hebrew Congregation. “They don’t want to miss a test.” </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Is message getting through?</strong></h3>
<p>Despite the commitments in Northern Virginia, leaders with the interfaith group are not convinced that all teachers are following the directives. Students in Reston reported academic conflicts with Rosh Hashanah earlier this year. </p>
<p>“I thoroughly believe that our leaders at the county level are committed to solving these problems,” said Holzman. “I also thoroughly believe that the message is not getting to the classroom level.” </p>
<p>Eli Sporn, 16, notches nearly straight As at McLean High School in Virginia and plays soccer and basketball. Each year he is absent from school for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. His teachers are understanding, but missing schoolwork still looms. </p>
<p>“It kind of hangs over your head the entire time,” he said. </p>

Roughly $100 million set aside to help cushion individual market consumers against spiking health insurance premiums is headed back in the state budget.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Roughly one-third of the money set aside by lawmakers for a premium rebate program in 2017 will be returned to the state budget, according to a report from the state’s nonprofit health insurers. </p>
<p>The rebates were meant to help cushion individual market consumers against spiking premiums, but the job didn’t require the full $312 million set aside by the Legislature. </p>
<p>The report from the Minnesota Council of Health Plans said the program was challenging to implement, but ultimately worked by helping 100,000 people handle premium jumps. </p>
<p>“The fact that fewer people bought health insurance on their own in 2017 than in the previous years is one reason the state spent less than projected,” the report stated. “Overall, about 190,000 Minnesotans bought on their own in 2017 — 60,000 fewer than 2016 and about 100,000 fewer than 2015.” </p>
<p>Lawmakers created the premium rebate program as one of several responses to the near collapse of the state’s individual market in 2016. </p>
<p>After Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota announced it was pulling all but its HMO products from the market, regulators said that all other carriers nearly bolted. In the end, insurers were allowed to hike premiums by 50 percent or more and limit enrollment, in many cases. </p>

<p>The rebate program provides a 25 percent discount on insurance premiums throughout 2017 for certain people who buy coverage in the state’s individual health insurance market. Fewer than 5 percent of state residents buy individual policies, which are primarily sold to people under age 65 who are either self-employed or don’t get coverage from an employer. </p>
<p>The rebate program was administered by the Minnesota Management and Budget (MMB) department, where Commissioner Myron Frans on Friday agreed with the projection that roughly $100 million would go back to the state budget. </p>
<p>Uptake was limited by the fact that more people qualified for federal tax credits this year, and therefore didn’t qualify for or require the rebates, Frans said. The timeline of the program’s launch was a factor, he added, since it came at the end of the open enrollment period for 2017 coverage. </p>
<p>Talk of an earlier launch for the program fizzled in December 2016 when negotiations for handling the rebates and other issues in a special session of the Legislature broke down during a public summit between DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt. </p>
<p>Overall, Frans said he believed the program was a success, since it helped keep people in an individual market that’s been shrinking since 2014. Some who bought early in the open-enrollment period likely did so, he said, on the assumption that the rebate program would be adopted. </p>
<p>“We felt that it was a success,” Frans said. “You never know what would have happened had we not done it.” </p>
<h3>‘No one’s perfect solution’ </h3>
<p>The premium rebate program was part of legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House and Senate in January, and signed into law by Dayton. Rep. Joe Hoppe, R-Chaska, said the legislation “was no one’s perfect solution,” but got results. </p>
<p>“Other states were envious of what we got done in Minnesota,” Hoppe said. </p>
<p>Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, reiterated his earlier criticism that “Republican intransigence” limited the number of people who could benefit from rebates, but said overall that the program “was worth doing.” </p>
<p>MMB said that 115,049 people had used rebates as of November. A final accounting is not yet available. </p>
<p>Extra funds will be distributed according to the Health and Human Services budget bill from the 2017 legislative session, MMB says. Up to $16.5 million goes to the Department of Human Services for efforts to better manage human services; up to $82.3 million will fund anticipated managed care costs. After the first two steps, any remaining funds will go to the state’s reserve fund, according to MMB. </p>
<p>Insurers charged premiums that reflected the rebate before the state determined if an enrollee was eligible. In cases where an enrollee was deemed ineligible — perhaps because they qualified instead for a public health insurance program — carriers had the option of trying to collect the difference. </p>
<p>After factoring those collection efforts, “about $600,000 in subsidies ended up not being reimbursed,” the Minnesota Council of Health Plans said in its report. </p>
<p>Insurers said they spent $2 million implementing the program, adding that health plans covered those costs on their own. “Every state dollar went directly to premium relief, just as legislators intended,” the report stated. </p>
<p>MMB said health plans were reimbursed only for rebates, and not administrative costs, on the theory that insurers benefited from the one-time subsidies for their customers. </p>
<p>“We provided a lot of support for the health insurance market,” Frans said, “and felt that any costs [running] this program should be borne by them.” </p>
<p>The program stops providing rebates with the new year, and there have been questions about whether subscribers might drop out once the subsidies are gone. There’s not yet full information about 2018 enrollment in the market, but James Schowalter, chief executive of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, said in a statement: “With much more stable premiums, people have a much better opportunity to figure out what they want to do for 2018.” </p>
<p>While 190,000 people have purchased individual health plans at different times in 2017, the overall enrollment tally is lower at any one point in time since people come in and out of the market. </p>
<p>The trade group said individual market enrollment at the end of the third quarter stood at 156,868 — about 12,000 less than at the end of the first quarter. The individual market typically shrinks over the course of the year, as people find other sources of coverage, such as from an employer, or opt to go without insurance. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>St. Paul Mayor-elect Melvin Carter announced director appointments for city departments Friday, picking six new leaders and retaining four already working in those roles, after community hiring panels weighed in on the possible candidates. </p>
<p>Among the new hires is a new city attorney, Lyndsey Olson, who is now general counsel of the Minnesota National Guard. Other new leaders will oversee libraries, technology, planning, human resources and emergency management. </p>
<p>The selection comes after more than 100 people served on panels to interview and deliberate over candidates. </p>
<p>“With their help and support, we have engaged a group of department leaders that bring a rich, diverse set of values, backgrounds, and skills,” Carter said in a statement. </p>
<p>Bruce Corrie will oversee the city’s Department of Planning and Economic Development. Corrie, an associate vice president of Concordia University, is known for his work studying the impact economic impact of minorities and immigrants. Sharon Kennedy Vickers, who will oversee the Office of Technology and Communications, works as an IT management consultant for the city. She co-founded the group Blacks in Technology Twin Cities in 2015. </p>
<p>The new library director is Catherine Penkert, who has worked at the city in a variety of roles since 2008, most recently as the senior innovation consultant. Andrea L. Turner will oversee the Department of Human Resources after holding the same role for the state’s Management and Budget office, as well as Department of Administration. An emergency management coordinator for the city, Lucy Angelis, will become the acting director of the Emergency Management Department. </p>
<p>Department directors under Mayor Chris Coleman who will retain their posts are Ricardo Cervantes of the Department of Safety and Inspections, Mike Hahm of the Department of Park and Recreation, Todd Hurley with the Office of Financial Services and Kathy Lantry of the Department of Public Works. </p>
<p>The city’s police chief, human rights director and general manager of water services were not up for reappointment. </p>

<p>If nothing else, 2017 has been a great year for opining. The following excerpts are from Star Tribune opinion articles ranked by highest online readership this year. To read the commentaries in their entirety, go to http//startribune.com/opinion and use the embedded links. </p>
<h4>1. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/no-sympathy-here-for-that-airline-passenger/419317024/">No sympathy here for that airline passenger</a>,” by Bob Gust, a lawyer living in Bloomington.</h4>
<p>While the world rages against United Airlines, I am outraged by the selfishness of the passenger removed from a plane in the much-discussed incident — and by the lack of critical thinking among everyone else. </p>
<h4>2. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/racial-identity-policies-are-ruining-edina-s-fabled-schools/449825893/">Racial identity politics are ruining Edina’s fabled schools</a>,” by Katherine Kersten, senior policy fellow, Center of the American Experiment.</h4>
<p>In place of academic excellence for all, the district’s primary mission is now to ensure that students think correctly on social and political issues — most important, on race and “white privilege.” </p>
<h4>3. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/a-minneapolis-tale-for-those-who-downplay-white-privilege/444544853/">A Minneapolis tale for those who downplay white privilege</a>,” by Richard G. Carlson, of Minneapolis, a retired assistant public defender.</h4>
<p>If you’re white and have a 13-year-old son, do you imagine he could end up facing five armed cops and a police dog because you told him it was OK to go down the block and knock on his friend’s door on a sunny Saturday afternoon in May? </p>
<h4>4. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/there-s-no-reason-to-buy-13-reasons-why-imagery/419505493/">There’s no reason to buy ‘13 Reasons Why’ imagery</a>,” by Lauren Abdill, of Minneapolis, a crisis counselor and master of social work student at the University of St. Thomas/St. Catherine University.</h4>
<p>So parents of teens, I beg you: Talk to your kids about suicide. Talk to them about “13 Reasons Why.” Save the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s number in their phone. </p>
<h4>5. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-shooting-of-justine-damond-it-s-time-to-decide-who-runs-this-town/435274073/">After Minneapolis police shooting of Justine Damond, it’s time to decide who runs this town</a>,” by Richard G. Carlson, of Minneapolis, a retired assistant public defender.</h4>
<p>For the record, I want it to be known that I object to being policed this way. As between the Minneapolis Police Department and the civilian authorities in my town, it is the civilians who must be in control. </p>
<h4>6. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/with-15-wage-in-minneapolis-say-goodbye-to-full-service-restaurants/425809483/">With $15 wage in Minneapolis, say goodbye to full-service restaurants</a>,” by Charles Lodge, an owner of Ginger Hop Restaurant in Minneapolis.</h4>
<p>If you have never pored over your books and lain awake at night wondering how you are going to make payroll, then you don’t understand how this restaurant game works. </p>
<h4>7. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/downtown-minneapolis-once-was-a-great-place-to-live-no-more/446939973/">Downtown Minneapolis once was a great place to live. No more</a>,” by Carter Averbeck, of Minneapolis, reprinted from City Pages.</h4>
<p>When I moved into the Warehouse District of Minneapolis in 2000, my dream of a wonderful home in the heart of the city came true. But in recent years, all that had been idyllic has changed. </p>
<h4>8. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/we-took-major-heat-for-backing-trump/427547013/">We took major heat for backing Trump; here’s what we think now</a>,” by Gary Abernathy, publisher and editor of the (Hillsboro, Ohio) Times-Gazette.</h4>
<p>I thought our endorsement of Donald Trump for president last year seemed innocuous enough. Then someone said to me, “Did you see that Rachel Maddow mentioned the Times-Gazette last night?” </p>
<h4>9. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-sad-truth-behind-the-congested-mess-on-twin-cities-roads/427331083/">The sad truth behind the congested mess on Twin Cities roads</a>,” by John Hinderaker, president of the Center of the American Experiment.</h4>
<p>The reality is that no matter how much money we spend on trains — an obsolete, 19th-century technology — they will never make more than a minor contribution toward the area’s transportation needs. </p>
<h4>10. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/impeach-president-trump-nah-but-invoke-the-25th-amendment-hmm/422641744/">Impeach President Trump? Nah. But invoke the 25th Amendment? Hmm …</a>,” by Marshall H. Tanick, a Twin Cities constitutional law attorney.</h4>
<p>In the campaign, and ever since, President Donald Trump has often promised that things soon would be different. This may be the occasion to try, for the first time, a temporary hiatus under the 25th Amendment that would allow him some time off. </p>
<h4>11. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-edina-schools-to-this-white-male-there-s-no-culture-of-intimidation/450147873/">Counterpoint: Edina Schools: To this white male, there’s no ‘culture of intimidation</a>,’ ” by Charles Heinecke, a junior at Edina High School.</h4>
<p>I don’t understand how it is a bad thing to teach young students that diversity is important. This is especially true in Edina. </p>
<h4>12. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/this-must-be-the-place-the-star-power-of-st-louis-park/412015366/">This must be the place: The star power of St. Louis Park</a>,” by Richard Harris, a freelance writer living in Bethesda, Md.</h4>
<p>St. Louis Park seemed too good to be true — civic-minded, education-centered and “Minnesota nice” — so I decided I had to make the journey Alexis de Tocqueville missed to see for myself. </p>
<h4>13. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/a-farewell-to-skyways-the-case-for-bringing-them-down/420124113/">A farewell to skyways: The case for bringing them down</a>,” by Eric Dayton, co-owner of businesses in the North Loop neighborhood of Minneapolis.</h4>
<p>We’re a 2017 city living with 1967 urban-design thinking, and it’s not working for us anymore. </p>
<h4>14. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/here-s-something-for-democrats-to-meditate-upon/453707923/">Here’s something for Democrats to meditate upon</a>,” by D.J. Tice, Star Tribune commentary editor and columnist.</h4>
<p>Ours is a best-of-times, worst-of-times era for American liberalism. I’ve seen the contradictions up close in recent weeks. </p>
<h4>15. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/seven-ways-liberals-must-realign-with-middle-america/418696503/">Seven ways liberals must realign with Middle America</a>,” by Doug R. Berdie, of Minneapolis, a semiretired marketing executive and researcher.</h4>
<p>I’m distressed by how little liberal activists seem to have learned from recent election results. </p>
<h4>16. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-real-history-of-mount-rushmore/388715411/">The real history of Mount Rushmore</a>,” by Ron Way, of Edina, a former official of the U.S. Interior Department and its National Park Service.</h4>
<p>Some see the monument in the Black Hills as one of the spoils of violent conquest over indigenous tribes by a U.S. Army clearing the way for white settlers driven westward by a lust for land and gold. </p>
<h4>17. “ <a href="http://www.startribune.com/editorial-endorsement-jacob-frey-for-minneapolis-mayor/453707743/">Editorial endorsement: Jacob Frey for Minneapolis mayor</a>,” by the Star Tribune Editorial Board.</h4>
<p>At age 36 and still serving his first term, Jacob Frey is a gifted communicator who has stood out on the City Council as both a leading voice and a consensus-builder. </p>

<p>It seems that a video put out by Vanity Fair has advised Hillary Clinton to take up knitting, among other suggestions, to help her get over her election loss to Donald Trump. But why not encourage President Trump to start knitting as well? In fact, I have long maintained that Trump should learn to knit, but specifically using the “in-the-round” style (as opposed to regular “flat” knitting). That way, he would always be working on the right side! He has already mastered the going-around-in-circles part of it. </p>

<h4>WHY GOVERNMENT IS MISTRUSTED </h4>
<h4>Exhibit A: Instant pay raises. Exhibit B: Apologism for same. </h4>
<p>Commenting on the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/readers-write-minneapolis-city-council-guns-great-books-the-culture/466869893/">Dec. 28 letter </a>about the Minneapolis City Council pay hike (“Pay hike was realistic thing to do,” commenting on “Council pay hike needlessly sneaky,” <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-s-pay-hike-needlessly-sneaky/466668853/">editorial</a>, Dec. 27). Oh, please. The whole position from the Star Tribune was not the pay hike but how it was done. The reader’s comments give the old position of many politicians when they take the old woe-is-me attitude. This is why most people have a less-than-high opinion of politicians. The reader stated that transparency is not always fair or practical. What a bunch of hooey. What is so impractical in stating a resolution?</p>
<p>And they wonder why they are not trusted. </p>
<p>Barry Jorgenson, Stillwater </p>
<h4>• • • </h4>
<p>The Star Tribune Editorial Board seems upset that Minneapolis City Council members gave themselves “sneaky” pay raises. Well, at least some of them will keep working while being paid at the higher rate. Compare this with U.S. Sen. Al Franken’s “sneaky” raise he gave himself, by resigning on Jan. 2 instead of Dec. 31. His raise will last for a lifetime, and he will not work a single day while “enjoying” it! (He will get paid an extra $3,000 a year in pension money by waiting to retire in 2018 instead of 2017). </p>
<p>Richard Trickel, Crosslake, Minn. </p>
<h4>CHRISTMAS, CONTINUED </h4>
<h4>‘War of words’ at the U? Is that all? My donation depends on it. </h4>
<p>The recent University of Minnesota <a href="http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-memo-sparks-war-of-words-but-no-war-on-christmas/466691113/">controversy</a> (“War of words, not ‘war on Christmas,’ at the U,” Dec. 27) is being called “ill-advised” by school officials. I suspect the real reason they are red-faced is because a memo about holiday parties in the agricultural college got far too much public exposure. Yet I am sure that U officials agree that we should “value our diversity” and “all are welcome” slogans. Yet this mentality exists? Obviously, there is a special dislike for traditions of American culture and religion. But how will the graduates cope when they leave that enclave of “safe spaces”? I’ll remember this when I receive the U’s alumni donation letter.</p>
<p>Joe Polunc, Cologne </p>
<h4>• • • </h4>
<p>The recommendations cited in the Dec. 27 article are largely reasonable ones for a public university. The line between “winter-themed” and “Christmas-themed” may seem blurry in some cases, but I suggest the following gauge: If the decoration would seem out of place at the beginning of February, then it’s probably related to a religious holiday and should not be promoted by a public institution. The end of a semester and beginning of a break are reason enough for a campus to celebrate. </p>

<h4>POLICE SHOOTING </h4>
<h4>Freeman must explain delay in deciding whether to charge </h4>
<p>Because Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman is a public servant, he owes the public a detailed timeline of his investigation into the fatal police shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond ( <a href="http://www.startribune.com/freeman-says-charging-decision-in-justine-damond-shooting-will-be-made-in-2018/467016783/">“Freeman puts off decision in Justine Damond’s death,”</a> Dec. 29). All of this talk only goes so far; the public wants answers. He had better come up with some kind of discovery that merits the amount of time he’s taken. We, the public, pay prosecutors well and have expectations. We don’t want to hear any excuses. Murder like this has no excuses.</p>
<p>Jim Goudy, Austin, Minn. </p>
<h4>GREAT BOOKS, CONTINUED </h4>
<h4>What else was missing </h4>
<p>English Prof. Geri Giebel Chavis ( <a href="http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-list-of-40-greatest-books-was-sorely-lacking-in-female-authors/466869333/">counterpoint</a>, Dec. 28) contended that law Profs. Robert Delahunty and John Radsan excluded women from <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-40-greatest-books-we-all-should-read/466007713/">their</a> “40 greatest books we all should read” (Opinion Exchange, Dec. 23). I agree, but the list is even more “sorely lacking” culturally. Their Western classics, limited to fiction, include only about 20 percent of the planet’s people.</p>
<p>China is home to one-fourth of the human family, and its contributions to the “world bank of knowledge” are immense. Huston Smith, in his book “The World’s Religions,” declares that Confucianism influenced “more people over a longer period and a larger area than any world philosophy.” But the Confucian Analects are not mentioned. </p>
<p>China brought the world four innovations that changed history: printing, paper, gunpowder and the compass. They are not mentioned. </p>
<p>Hinduism is practiced by about one-fifth of the world community, but its “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are excluded. Similarly, India is credited with originating the essential component of our computer world: the decimal system. The reader of the 40 books will never learn this. </p>
<p>The Western world fares little better. John Locke’s principal role in shaping Western values receives only a cursory glance. Similarly, the bedrocks of Western ethics receive scant attention: the Twelve Tables of Rome (law), the Magna Carta (trial by jury) and the religious Toleration Act of 17th-century England are absent. </p>
<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. declared that unless we learn to live together, as brothers and sisters, we will die together as fools. To develop awareness of our commonalities, we must teach that the world community is composed of a range of different — and equally valid — accomplishments. Claiming limited exclusivity exacerbates an already volatile world. </p>
<p>Mark Welter, Ramsey </p>

<p>Please add the three most essential African-American books: “Native Son,” by Richard Wright, “Invisible Man,” by Ralph Ellison, and “Cry, the Beloved Country,” by Alan Paton. </p>
<p>Please leave Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” since it, along with “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” by Harriet Beecher Stowe, were the most influential books written by whites about slavery. </p>

<p>Here’s yet another thought on the “40 greatest books” from yet another English teacher. Several of the books listed in this interesting but always futile effort to objectify opinions are books written in a language other than English. Translation was mentioned in passing, but I think it’s a big deal. </p>
<p>English is the only language I know, therefore I will never be able to read Dostoyevsky or Cervantes or Dante or Homer or Proust or Tolstoy or any other book ever written in Russian or Greek or Spanish or Portuguese or Farsi or Vietnamese or any language other than English. Unless, of course, I learn another language. But I am aging and lazy, and I still struggle mightily with even the Middle English of Chaucer. So all I can ever read when it comes to a dozen or so of the 39 books listed is somebody’s translation of that book, which, of course, is not the book. I can get the story and the characters and perhaps even the message, but I will never be able to read the book as written, just some translator’s version which, however brilliant, will never be the original. So for me, the movie might do just fine and I can spend my reading time either learning another language or reading any one of thousands of other truly great books written in the language that I do I know. I think I might start by rereading William Golding’s “The Lord of the Flies.” How did that not make the list? And away we go. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The news narrative in 2017 was so extraordinary that it can’t be captured in a word. </p>
<p>So how about four of them? </p>
<p>Words of the year from four dictionaries, as well as PolitFact’s “Lie of the year,” all reflected the news of 2017 and projected a 2018 that looks to be just as turbulent. </p>
<p>Like nearly everything in these politically polarized times, each choice is linguistically laden with partisan interpretation. Take <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year-2017/">dictionary.com’s choice</a> of “complicit,” which it defines as “choosing to be involved in a questionable act, especially with others; having partnership or involvement in wrongdoing.”</p>
<p>The word was widespread in its usage and utility — particularly in investigating how Harvey Weinstein’s coterie cauterized him from cascading allegations of sexual harassment. Beyond that seminal trigger of the #MeToo movement there were three specific spikes in lookups: on the Sunday after the “Saturday Night Live” <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/complicit/3483871?snl=1">spoof spot</a> for Ivanka Trump’s “Complicit Perfume” (“the fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won’t”); Ivanka’s response in an interview with “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ivanka-trump-on-what-it-means-to-be-complicit/">CBS This Morning</a>”; and when U.S. Sen. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/10/24/jeff-flake-will-not-be-complicit-senate-floor-sot.cnn">Jeff Flake</a>, the Arizona Republican who wrote “Conscience of a Conservative,” announced his retirement by declaring “I won’t be complicit.”</p>
<p>The question of complicity is central to congressional and special counsel probes of Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The extent, if any, of the Trump campaign’s complicity is unknown. What is certain, according to a consensus intelligence report, is that Moscow meddled in America’s democracy. </p>
<p>Yet there are still high-level denials that this even happened, including from the person the <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">report</a> states was the intended beneficiary: President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>PolitiFact belied this line of thinking by naming the claim that “Russian interference is a ‘made-up story’ ” its 2017 “ <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/12/2017-lie-year-russian-election-interference-made-s/">Lie of the Year</a>,” which is like a word of the year, but with a forked tongue.</p>
<p>“Trump continually asserts that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election is fake news, a hoax or a made-up story, even though there is widespread, bipartisan evidence to the contrary,” PolitiFact concluded. </p>
<h4>“ <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/woty">Fake news</a>” itself is Collins Dictionary’s word(s) of the year, which it defines as “false, often sensational information disseminated under the guise of news reporting.”</h4>
<p>Fake news is a real thing and really dangerous to democracies — especially when it’s disseminated from Russian operatives attempting to discredit Western institutions and individuals, including, allegedly, Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>But to Trump, the term has become a catchall for all that is thrown at him, including nagging allegations about some kind of collusion with Russia during the campaign, which Trump denied 16 times in a 30-minute <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-excerpts.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">interview</a> published in Friday’s New York Times.</p>
<p>At least among his political base, Trump’s baseless characterization of well-sourced journalism may be working. Research commissioned by the Poynter Institute indicates that “Trump’s frequent attacks on journalists and threats to press freedom have widened a stark, partisan divide in attitudes toward the media.” </p>
<p>The political implications don’t stop, but start, at the water’s edge. </p>
<p>“ ‘Fake News,’ Trump’s Obsession, Is Now a Cudgel for Strongmen,” read a recent New York Times headline on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/world/europe/trump-fake-news-dictators.html?_r=0">story</a> detailing dictators’ adaptation of Trump’s famous phrase.</p>
<p>For example, Syrian President Bashar Assad dodged questions on his horrific human rights record by stating that “we are living in a fake-news era.” And the foreign ministry of Myanmar — site of ethnic cleansing against the Muslim-minority Rohingya — now uses a big red “FAKE” stamp on unfavorable stories. Other autocrats automatically invoke the phrase, too. </p>
<p>Two other words were key to encapsulating 2017 but may be even more consequential in 2018, particularly if they’re combined. </p>
<p>The august Oxford Dictionaries chose “ <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2017">youthquake</a>” as its word of the year. The phenomenon, defined as “a significant cultural, political and social change arising from the actions or influence of young people,” manifested itself in many forms this year, especially in Britain, where youth rallied around the sexagenarian leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. “Youthquake” lookups surged fivefold last year, and Labour leapt in the election, too.</p>
<p>On this side of the pond, younger voters were also a crucial coalition component to Democratic victories in Virginia and Alabama. So, too, were women voters, and if the two cohorts combine again in 2018, Merriam-Webster’s 2017 word of the year, “ <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-of-the-year-2017-feminism">feminism</a>,” will have profound resonance next year, too.</p>
<p>The spike in lookups for “feminism” started with the Women’s March on Washington (and other cities) in January. The term, defined as “the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes,” surged in interest again when Kellyanne Conway contested that she would not consider herself a feminist. Other inquiry pops came from pop culture itself, including the messages of “The Handmaid’s Tale” and even “Wonder Woman.” And the interest increased recently with the unrivaled unraveling of consequential careers due to allegations of sexual misconduct, an ongoing development that the Associated Press named its <a href="https://www.apnews.com/afs:Content:1658600019/Sexual-misconduct-allegations-voted-top-news-story-in-annual-AP-poll-of-U.S.-editors,-news-directors">top 2017 news story</a>. Time, too, noted the impact by naming “The Silence Breakers: The Voices that Launched a Movement” as its annual “<a href="http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/">Person of the Year</a>.”</p>
<p>The silence continues to be broken, and beyond the #MeToo movement the next year in general is likely to be loud as a midterm election elevates the issues of complicity, the role of real and rhetorical “fake news,” and the impact of younger and women voters. And if 2017 is any guide, unforeseen events will also shape the narrative — and the words to describe it, too. </p>
<p>But one prediction seems safe: “Tranquility” will not be 2018’s word of the year. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Among the many demographic lessons from this past year, one of the most important has been that white women in the United States are not a unified political front. </p>
<p>Their votes did not carry Hillary Clinton into the White House, nor did the disturbing allegations of sexual predation against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore stop a majority of white women there from voting for him. </p>
<p>But the two biggest cinematic events of the past year — “Wonder Woman” and now “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” — tell a different story. </p>
<p>Anchored by unflappable female warriors who function as the beating moral hearts of worlds corrupted by male hubris, both films reaped the financial rewards of aspirational images of white female leadership that are self-congratulatory and easy for the political class to embrace. Clinton recently received the Wonder Woman award from the Women’s Media Center and even compared herself to the ageless Themysciran in an e-mail to supporters. </p>
<p>But as products of consumer culture removed from political realities, the heroines in these movies are distorting the truth for Americans. </p>
<p>They gratify audiences by mirroring their own beliefs back to them — depicting white women as heroic paragons of virtue crusading for righteous causes — which, in turn, licenses viewers to avoid having either to acknowledge the more complicated role white women are playing in our politics or to consider what other forms of racialized womanhood these heroines are occluding. So, while these films may trade on a widespread desire for transformative change, they are also replaying cultural scripts that seem on the verge of exhaustion, in the process foreclosing more transformative artistic and political possibilities. </p>

<p></p>
<p>This isn’t the first time in the history of American popular culture that a work whose white heroine was tasked with saving an entire social order met an unprecedented consumer demand and, as a result, had its political afterlife severely compromised. </p>
<p>Indeed, this cultural construct can be traced back at least a century and a half, when the U.S. public worshiped at the altar of another fictional white girl from a work even more divisive than “The Last Jedi” is proving to be. </p>
<p>The character was/is Evangeline St. Clare, and the work, “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” </p>
<p>Published in 1852, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s debut novel was the first global literary blockbuster, selling millions of copies worldwide. A contemporary reader called Stowe’s sweeping epic of slaves, fugitives, Southerners and abolitionists in the antebellum United States a national “epidemic” — everywhere he went, people were talking about “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” </p>
<p>Although the novel’s most infamous legacy has been the uses and abuses of its eponymous hero, the character who won the hearts of its 19th-century audience was the angelic Evangeline, better known as Little Eva. </p>
<p>The daughter of the languid slave owner Augustine St. Clare, Eva is the flaxen-haired image of antebellum Protestant piety. Pale and pure, she is a Christ figure passed through the Victorian cult of the child. Everyone she touches — white and black — experiences her unconditional love, which, in turn, awakens their own more tender feelings. And her inevitable death — by consumption, naturally — promises the redemption not just of her immediate family but potentially of an entire nation. </p>
<p>Eva’s death in many ways represented the apex of antebellum sentimentalism, an aesthetic and philosophical movement that privileged feelings as a viable path to the good (and even to God). </p>
<p>The novel was so popular that Uncle Tom merchandise flooded the nation within months of its release. These “Tomitudes” included poems, songs, ceramic figurines, card games, dinner plates and spoons. One observer lamented that “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” had infiltrated the “drawing room, nursery, kitchen, library.” </p>
<p>As a result, Little Eva quickly transformed from a character into a commodity. She was a capitalist Eucharist for a sentimental public, soothing with saccharine — and usually offensive — models of white femininity and race relations. While Stowe had intended Eva to exemplify the power of interracial tenderness, she congealed over time into a schmaltzy synthesis of whiteness, innocence and Christianity. </p>
<p>Sentimentalism was not as politically inert as Little Eva may make it seem, however. It could do cultural work. </p>
<p>Stowe’s novel galvanized abolitionist sympathizers, unnerved slaveholders and maybe even softened a few hard hearts. Nevertheless, Little Eva’s post-novelistic life as a commodity still functioned, in the words of one of her most severe critics, as an “introduction to consumerism.” Like other sentimental consumer products of the era, Eva responded to desires and beliefs consumers already had. </p>
<p>Thus, according to historian Robin Bernstein, while Eva emerged as the pinnacle of pious white innocence, the novel’s black characters (especially Uncle Tom and the slave girl Topsy) were marketed to consumers as odious cultural stereotypes from which we have yet to fully recover. </p>
<p>There are many ways in which the supernaturally gifted white heroines of 2017 differ from the consumptive Eva. Besides being older, both Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) and Rey are fighters whose physicality is foregrounded. They also, unlike Eva, did not need to die to activate sympathies. </p>
<p>But beneath their super powers and death-defying acrobatics, with their stoic resolve and religious asceticism, these fictional women continue to stand as avatars of an unblemished white womanhood that clings to the old sentimental dream that they may still perhaps make their fellow characters — and the audiences witnessing them — feel the correct feelings. </p>
<p>It is virtually impossible not to be stirred by Wonder Woman’s fearless, slow-motion advance through No Man’s Land or Rey’s balletic lightsaber dual against her fanboy antagonist. But however moved we might be, these scenes are still designed to flatter sensibilities rather than challenge them. </p>
<p>According to eBay, Wonder Woman and Rey were the most sought-after fictional female characters this past year. The force of consumerism, at least, remains strong with them. Thus, just as it did in Stowe’s era, white femininity continues to be sold successfully as a moral compass for mass culture. This, for better or worse, papers over the moral ambivalence of the voting patterns and affiliations of actual white women in the U.S. </p>
<p>Despite all that is genuinely inspiring about these films, their narratives continue to turn on the notion that cultural salvation is the work of white women, which implicitly sidelines the political contributions, moral influence and daily efforts of women of color, not unlike Little Eva’s dramatic death and sudden rise to literary prominence did in 1852. </p>
<p>If the events of the past two years have taught us anything, it’s that our conventional narratives of political change are impoverished. </p>
<p>Perhaps, then, our current crop of cinematic heroines is not aspirational enough, too hindered by the demands of a market. For all the plaudits African-American women have gotten from the left in the wake of the Alabama Senate race, it is still not they who are reaping billions of dollars at the global box office. Maybe the release of the tentpole film “A Wrinkle in Time” this spring, with its young black female lead, will prove to be the much-needed corrective. Ava DuVernay, you’re our only hope. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The woman who built Buffalo Wild Wings into a restaurant juggernaut is leaving on her own terms after all. </p>
<p>Sally Smith, who as chief executive of Buffalo Wild Wings since 1996, appeared in June to have been pushed into retirement by a hard-fought proxy battle with an activist investor who called her “out to lunch.” </p>
<p>But it turns out she was playing on a different level, having already taken steps in what would become a $2.9 billion sale of the Golden Valley-based company. </p>
<p>Smith was approached in February by representatives of Roark Capital Group, the Atlanta investment firm that owns more than a dozen of the nation’s largest restaurant chains. Roark wanted to buy Buffalo Wild Wings, and the sides reached a deal in November, months after the company appeared to have been upended by activist investor Richard “Mick” McGuire’s strategic takeover and Smith’s announced plan to retire by the end of the year. </p>
<p>On Friday, a company spokeswoman confirmed Smith would be staying with Buffalo Wild Wings through the completion of the sale. A day earlier, Buffalo Wild Wings sent its shareholders the voting documents to accept or reject Roark’s takeover offer at a special meeting scheduled for Feb. 2. </p>
<p>In those documents, the company asked shareholders to approve the sale. It also asked them to approve a nonbinding recommendation on Roark for special “golden parachute” payouts to Buffalo Wild Wings executives, including Smith, who will be leaving the firm after the sale. For Smith, the payout in salary, stock and benefits amounts to slightly more than $5 million. </p>

<p>The documents also described the 10-month process by which the deal came together, showing that Roark reached out in February and first met with Smith a month later. Smith in turn arranged for the Roark executives to meet in April the company’s chairman, Jerry Rose. </p>
<p>At the time, Smith and Rose were nearing the end of a bitter, public battle with McGuire, whose San Francisco-based investment fund Marcato Capital had taken a sizable stake in Buffalo Wild Wings in summer 2016. McGuire was seeking to place four people on the company’s board of directors at the company’s June annual meeting in hopes of making changes, including selling most of the company-owned restaurants to franchisees. </p>
<p>McGuire’s campaign against Buffalo Wild Wings and Smith grew increasingly acrimonious. In April, he wrote a letter to shareholders criticizing the company’s recent stock performance and said Smith and other executives were “seemingly out to lunch as the business has deteriorated.” </p>
<p>While their fight continued in public, Smith and Rose in early May provided the first nonpublic information to Roark, the voting documents show. There was no further contact with Roark until after Buffalo Wild Wings’ annual meeting on June 2, when McGuire won some board seats, including one for himself, and Smith announced her retirement plan. </p>
<p>When the company’s new board met for the first time in late June, Rose revealed the discussions he and Smith had with the Roark executives. Paul Brown, chief executive of Roark-owned Arby’s Restaurants Inc., attended the board’s next meeting in August and discussed his company’s ongoing interest in Buffalo Wild Wings. </p>
<p>The two sides first put terms to paper on Aug. 22, with a nonbinding letter in which Roark’s Arby’s indicated a willingness to pay between $145 and $150 a share. That was far above Buffalo Wild Wings’ $103-a-share stock price at the time. </p>
<p>McGuire, who had built up his stake in Buffalo Wild Wings in 2016 when its shares were priced around $155, told financial advisers to Arby’s that the company would likely require a higher price. Arby’s in mid-September sent another nonbinding letter indicating a range of $150 to $157 a share. </p>
<p>On Nov. 13, several media outlets, citing anonymous sources, reported that Buffalo Wild Wings and Roark were negotiating a deal for more than $150 a share. Those reports sent shares in the company skyrocketing. </p>
<p>The voting document revealed that the reports also prompted three other companies to reach out to Goldman Sachs, which was representing Buffalo Wild Wings, with interest in making a deal of their own. For about a week, Goldman Sachs executives held discussions with those three firms and four others about the prospect of buying Buffalo Wild Wings. </p>
<p>Over the next two weeks and through Thanksgiving weekend, the two sides traded counterproposals in which Buffalo Wild Wings sought a higher price and Roark sought assurance that Buffalo Wild Wings wouldn’t seek other buyers. The final deal, announced Nov. 27 at $157 a share, contained clauses that imposed sizable financial penalties on both companies if they walked away from it. McGuire announced he would support it, and one of the largest franchisee groups of Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants also praised it. </p>
<p>In a statement accompanying the announcement of the deal, Smith said that Roark’s ownership of Buffalo Wild Wings “will enable us to capitalize on significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Out of the way, Canada. Brady Tkachuk and the Americans are just fine when it comes to handling snow and ice. </p>
<p>Tkachuk and Kieffer Bellows found plenty enough traction on a snow-covered rink to score shootout goals and cap the United States’ 4-3 victory over Canada on Friday in international hockey’s first outdoor game. </p>
<p>Much like they did the similar two times against Canada at the world junior hockey championship, the defending gold-medal-winning Americans overcame a two-goal deficit by scoring twice in a span of 34 seconds in the third period. </p>
<p>“It just made it better with the snow coming down and the fans’ excitement. You could definitely feel it,” Tkachuk said of a game played with snow persistently falling from the opening faceoff. “We knew we were taking it to them in the second and third period and Coach was saying, if one goes in, two go in.” </p>
<p>A snowball effect, perhaps. And it happened in front of a world junior tournament record crowd of 44,592 — some going shirtless in celebrating the bitter elements — at the NFL Buffalo Bills’ home, New Era Field. </p>
<p>The Americans (1-1-1) showed resolve in not only beating their cross-border rivals, but overcoming the disappointment of a 3-2 loss to Slovakia on Thursday. </p>
<p>“That talks a lot about our group and the locker room and how close we are as a family,” Bellows said. “There was never a doubt in the whole entire locker room or on the bench at any point.” </p>
<p>Tkachuk and Ron Perunovich scored in the third period, while Casey Mittlestadt had three assists to take over the tournament lead with six points (two goals, four assists). Bellows scored his tournament leading fourth goal, and goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 19 shots through overtime and all four he faced in the shootout. </p>
<p>Boris Katchouk, Cale Makar and Dillon Dube scored for Canada (2-0-1), which has lost four straight meeting to the Americans. It was a familiar and disappointing result for goalie Carter Hart, who was also lost the championship game to the U.S. in January. </p>
<p>“Last year doesn’t matter at all,” said Hart, who stopped 32 shots through overtime Friday. “Tomorrow, we get the chance to finish in first place, so that’s what on our mind’s now.” </p>
<p>By earning a point for the shootout loss, Canada still has the edge in the Group A standings in being two points ahead of the Americans. The Canadians can clinch top spot with a win in their preliminary round finale against Denmark (0-3) on Saturday. </p>
<p>In the only other tournament game, St. Louis Blues draft pick Klim Kostin scored twice in leading Russia (2-1) to a 5-2 win over Belarus (0-3). Russia clinched a Group B berth in the quarterfinal round Tuesday. Belarus closes the preliminary round against the Czech Republic on Saturday and is in jeopardy of finishing last in five-team Group B standings. </p>
<p>Bellows scored on the Americans’ first shootout chance by snapping a shot through Hart’s legs. Then Tkachuk scored by firing a shot in the top right corner. </p>
<p>Down 3-1, Perunovich cut the lead to 3-2 from the slot by capping a give-and-go passing play with Mittelstadt with 13:51 left. Mittlestadt, the Buffalo Sabres’ first-round pick, then set up Tkachuk in front for the tying goal by gathering a loose puck behind the net after Canadian defenseman Kale Clague lost his stick. </p>
<p>The Americans drew upon last year’s win over Canada, in which they trailed 4-2. </p>
<p>“Just believing you’re never out of the game. We had a lot of hockey left to be played,” U.S. defenseman Adam Fox said. “Last year, it was a very similar thing. Some guys who are returning had that experience to tell guys this year that, ‘You know, we’re not down and out.’” </p>
<p>It was a familiar feeling of disappointment for Canada. </p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s a tough pill to swallow once again losing to the Americans in the shootout,” forward Michael McLeod said. “The only good thing is that this is round robin.” </p>
<p>The crowd on Friday appeared evenly split with American and Canadian fans, many of whom spent much of the game standing. As night fell, a red glow emanated from the middle section of the stadium, where rows of heaters hang above the seats. </p>
<p>Flurries began falling during the pre-game national anthems, and the snow fell harder as the game progressed. It began falling so heavily that the surface had to be shoveled at each commercial break starting late in the second period. Work crews filled several wheelbarrows full of snow, which were dumped onto a pile that grew to about seven feet behind the east end of the rink. </p>
<p>Oettinger had an opportunity to take time to enjoy the atmosphere. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I did see the shirtless guy on the Jumbotron. Yeah, I took a look a couple of times,” Oettinger said with a smile. “A really fun win, but now we’ve got to put it behind us.” </p>

        <title>To find top talent for your business, try this four-step process</title>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Sheppeck</h4>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q:</strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;"> </strong>Our company has ambitious growth goals for 2018. What is the best way to find top talent to achieve our growth goals?</p>
<p>Anonymous </p>
<p>A: Be sure to approach staffing growth with the same strategic approach you have for revenue growth. After all, you need top talent to achieve your ambitious goals. Let’s break it down into a four-step process. </p>
<p>1. Create a rough human-resources plan. Identify the jobs that are critical to the execution of your customer strategy. Ask yourself how many employees will be needed in each position if the business grows by 10, 25 or 50 percent. This activity simply helps you understand the magnitude of the recruiting effort you will need over time. </p>
<p>2. Get agreement among your leadership team about the definition of “top talent.” This differs for all organizations based on your approach to customer satisfaction. Typically, we see the following statements. Someone who … </p>
<p>• Possesses the types of competencies that allow the organization to take advantage of new business opportunities. </p>
<p>• Is positive and forward thinking. </p>
<p>• Spreads positive morale within the organization. </p>
<p>• Is excellent at problem-solving and decisionmaking. </p>
<p>• Motivates others; makes others better by his/her example. </p>
<p>• Shows empathy/compassion toward others. </p>
<p>• Understands the big picture for the organization. </p>
<p>3. Hiring top talent requires much more than just an interview. Use assessment tools that have been shown to predict high performance on the job. Design a simulation of important aspects of the job and have the individual respond to a series of situations that occurs on the job. Workers with top talent want to show you what they can do; give them every opportunity. </p>
<p>4. Recruit. Build relationships with professors that specialize in your business area. Contact a local professional association president for referrals; highly talented individuals usually belong to associations in their area of expertise. Ask talented people currently in your organization for referrals. </p>
<p>Once you have found those workers with top talent, reward them with stimulating work, contact with customers, contact with senior managers and opportunities to show what they can do. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">President Donald Trump</div>
                                    </div>
<p>The remaining members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS were fired en masse this week. </p>
<p>Months after a half-dozen members resigned in protest of the Trump administration’s position on health policies, the White House dismissed the rest through a form letter. </p>
<p>The notice “thanked me for my past service and said that my appointment was terminated, effective immediately,” said Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University who works on HIV testing programs. He was appointed to a four-year term in May 2016. </p>
<p>The council, known by the acronym PACHA, has advised the White House on HIV/AIDS policies since its founding in 1995. Members, who are not paid, offer recommendations on the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, a five-year plan responding to the epidemic. </p>
<p>The group is designed to include “doctors, members of industry, members of the community and, very importantly, people living with HIV,” said Scott Schoettes, an attorney with the LGBT rights organization Lambda Legal. “Without it, you lose the community voice in policymaking.” </p>
<p>Schoettes was among those who quit in June, and he went out with a fiery commentary in Newsweek. “The Trump Administration has no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and — most concerning — pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease,” he wrote in the column. </p>
<p>“We tried to stick it out,” Schoettes said on Friday. “The fact is you’re dealing with a public health issue. It’s not partisan at all.” </p>
<p>But the “writing was on the wall,” he continued. The Office of National AIDS Policy, established in 1993 during the Clinton administration, has not had a director since President Donald Trump took office. “The tipping point for me was the president’s approach to the Affordable Care Act,” Schoettes said. “It is of great importance for people living with HIV like myself.” </p>
<p>The council’s executive director, Kaye Hayes, confirmed in a statement that all remaining council members had received letters Wednesday “informing them that the administration was terminating their appointments.” </p>
<p>She did not address when the administration might begin to make new appointments to the council, which can number up to 25 members. Its most recent meeting took place in August, Sullivan said, and by November, an archived version of PACHA’s website shows the group was down to 10 members and two staff. </p>
<p>The website, which says it was updated Dec. 28, now shows two staff and no council members. </p>
<p>“Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during administration changes,” Hayes said in the statement. “The Obama administration dismissed the George W. Bush administration appointees to PACHA in order to bring in new voices. All PACHA members are eligible to apply to serve on the new council that will be convened in 2018.” </p>
<p>The Washington Blade reported that termination letters were delivered without warning by way of FedEx. Gabriel Maldonado, chief executive of the LGBT and HIV/AIDS group Truevolution and a council member until this week, said he could only speculate why the final members were fired. </p>
<p>“Like any administration, they want their own people there,” Maldonado, an Obama appointee, told the Blade. </p>
<p>But Sullivan and Schoettes said that previous administrations had allowed members to serve full terms before appointing replacements. “It is important to have a rolling, transitioning body that crosses administrations that really has a set of diverse outlooks on the epidemic,” Sullivan said. </p>
<p>In September, Trump issued an executive order that continued PACHA and 31 other advisory bodies through fall 2019. A call for new council member nominations went out via a Dec. 1 notice posted on the federal register. The nomination period closes on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Sullivan said he hoped that new members will “continue to engage around the issues that the previous PACHA brought up.” Schoettes is not optimistic that the notice will attract qualified people. </p>
<p>“The only criteria for serving this president is loyalty,” he said. “From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to this body, to the FBI, there is a real problem this president has with dialogue or dissent.” </p>

<p>Early this year, Cora Mustin felt she had run out of ways to control the violent rages of her 15-year-old son, Jordan, who has a severe form of autism. </p>
<p>At the slightest change in his environment, Jordan would lash out at his mother, sometimes biting and tearing at her hair. Each destructive outburst sent the family down a rabbit hole of frantic emergency room visits, failed treatments and new medical prescriptions. </p>
<p>This fall, Mustin enrolled Jordan in a promising new treatment program that is rapidly taking root across Minnesota. The Medicaid-funded program flips the traditional health care system inside out by putting patients and their families in control of their care and focusing on holistic recovery, not just managing symptoms. </p>
<p>A year ago, <a href="https://mn.gov/dhs/media/news/?id=1053-270163">Minnesota became one of just eight states</a> selected by federal officials to develop a statewide network of clinics that would provide “one-stop shopping” for mental health care. Since then, the model has taken flight. Nearly 5,000 people with a range of disorders, including mental illnesses and chemical addictions, enrolled in the program in just the first three months. State officials estimate that, if current trends continue, the program will be serving more than 15,000 patients by July, making it one of the broadest expansions of Minnesota’s community mental health system in years.</p>
<p>The allure of the program is its simplicity. </p>
<p>Traditionally, patients suffering from complex mental health problems must navigate a Byzantine maze of primary care clinics, treatment plans and eligibility requirements to get help. Under the new program, patients are given access to a team of specialists who provide a range of services, including outpatient counseling, primary care screening and family support, all under the direction of a single community clinic. Patients who were accustomed to waiting weeks, even months, to see a psychiatrist can get care within days. In some cases, professionals will even travel, meeting with patients in their homes. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The model has become a major recruitment tool at a time when psychologists and other mental health professionals are in short supply. Statewide, the six participating clinics have added roughly 100 new staff, including psychiatrists and addiction specialists, who are drawn by the coordinated-care model. Nationally, the new clinics have hired about 1,200 staff — countering a national trend of cuts in mental health services, according to a recent survey by the <a href="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/">National Council for Behavioral Health</a>.</p>
<p>“This is a real transformation,” said Claire Wilson, assistant commissioner at the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS), which has led the rollout. “This brings together all those different pieces of the mental health system that, up until now, have been so difficult for people to navigate.” </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Calming techniques</strong></h3>
<p>On a recent afternoon, Jordan Mustin rocked back and forth on the carpet of his bedroom, humming as soft holiday music wafted through the family’s apartment in Mounds View. Nearly everything about Jordan’s room, including the lava lamp on his bedstand and the soft pillows, are designed to put him at ease. At moments when Jordan becomes agitated, Mustin encourages him to rub his legs, or to count to 10 forward and backward. Sometimes she wraps Jordan in a weighted blanket to soothe his nerves. </p>
<p>Mustin said she only learned of some of these calming techniques after enrolling Jordan at the St. Paul-based nonprofit <a href="https://www.peopleincorporated.org/">People Incorporated</a>, the largest of the six community clinics offering the new array of services.</p>
<p>Overnight, Mustin had access to a team of specialists, including a psychiatrist, mental health counselor and a care coordinator who was available at almost all hours of the day. For the first time, Jordan attended regular mental health counseling, where he could talk about his feelings and the cause of his outbursts. He described, for instance, how rainstorms made him sad and anxious, and how simply closing the windows helped reduce his anxiety. </p>
<p>“It was the first time that a medical professional actually asked Jordan what was going on in his mind and suggested strategies for treating him,” Mustin said. “Before, doctors would just hand over a new medication and push him out the door.” </p>
<p>Since he started in August, Jordan’s outbursts have become less frequent and far less severe, his mother said. Better still, she no longer has to worry about making and keeping appointments with a long list of specialists, including a psychiatrist for his medications and a physician for his general health needs. Now, a care coordinator at People Inc. helps arrange all of Jordan’s appointments, often calling days ahead to help schedule a visit. </p>
<p>Hospitalizations are also less stressful. When Jordan was taken to the emergency room at Unity Hospital in Fridley during a recent breakdown, a care coordinator from People Inc. was at his bedside within 20 minutes. </p>
<p>“I no longer feel like I’m lost or that nobody cares,” Cora Mustin said. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">JFK’s vision</strong></h3>
<p>The idea of community-based mental health clinics is not new. In 1963, when President John Kennedy signed <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/homelessness-programs-resources/hpr-resources/jfk%E2%80%99s-legacy-community-based-care">the landmark Community Mental Health Act</a>, he envisioned a broad national network of clinics that would provide an alternative to large institutions and offer “comprehensive” care in the community, from inpatient treatment to community education. “The time has come for a bold new approach,” Kennedy declared in <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-052-012.aspx">a 1963 speech to Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s vision, however, was never realized, in large part because the clinics never received adequate funding. Today, patients still see different providers for mental health therapy, substance use and physical illnesses, a fragmented system that isolates people and prevents them from seeking treatment. Nationally, only 43 percent of all people living with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia receive behavioral health care, according to federal statistics. </p>
<p>“When people say they don’t know what the answers are to the crisis in our mental health system, they are wrong,” said Sue Abderholden, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Minnesota. “It’s programs like this, which offer a way to treat people more humanely.” </p>
<p>The new clinics operate on a different funding model, one that explains why they have expanded so quickly: They estimate how much it will cost to offer a bundle of services and then the federal-state Medicaid program reimburses them at a rate that covers actual costs. By contrast, providers say, the payment rates set by many large insurers are too low, discouraging clinics from accepting Medicaid patients. </p>
<p>The program, projected to cost Medical Assistance $46.4 million this fiscal year, is set to expire in July 2019 unless Congress appropriates more money. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Minneapolis Mayor-elect Jacob Frey at one of his many public events. He takes office next week and is getting ready to make adjustments.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Minneapolis Mayor-elect Jacob Frey ducked out of a City Council meeting earlier this month and left City Hall with his new entourage — a recently hired aide and a cop trying out for the job as Frey’s permanent security detail. </p>
<p>The trio hopped into a city-owned blue Ford Escape and, with the officer behind the wheel, eased across the river to a groundbreaking in Northeast. After Betsy Hodges leaves office next week, the giant black mayoral Chevy Tahoe will be his to use, though he’s not sure he wants it. </p>
<p>Three days before he takes office as the city’s 48th mayor, the 36-year-old Frey is already realizing he may have to give up some habits. </p>
<p>“I run or bike to 80 percent of my meetings, especially in the warmer months, so what’s that going to look like?” he said. “I literally run a lot, and it looks kind of weird and I’m in a suit, but if I’m just going from here to there I like to be as efficient as possible.” </p>
<p>The weight of the office is already settling on Frey. </p>
<p>Frey and the rest of the City Council voted to raise pay for themselves and the mayor with no public discussion in December, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/mayor-elect-frey-supports-his-raise-regrets-the-process/467050913/">a process he regretted immediately</a>. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo briefed Frey by telephone when officers <a href="http://www.startribune.com/police-shooting-victim-charged-with-earlier-shooting-and-robbery/465508913/">shot a man inside City Hall last week</a>. Minneapolis faces a housing affordability crisis that Frey has <a href="https://jacobfrey.org/affordable-housing-plan/">promised to address</a>, and he will be the face of the city as a worldwide audience turns its attention to the Super Bowl. Behind the scenes, he must help mend a broken relationship between the mayor’s office and the City Council.</p>
<p>His transition team led by former Mayor R.T. Rybak is focused on building a mayor’s office that can make good decisions quickly. To do that, Frey is learning to submit to his gatekeepers, those who run his schedule and control who he talks to, when and for how long. </p>
<p>“I’m a very accessible person, perhaps overly so,” he said. “One of the most important things with any administration is who gets on the calendar. If I’m meeting all with one group and not with another group, I’m probably going to develop an opinion that’s in line with this one group.” </p>
<p>He’s mostly unplugged from social media since the election, which he says has made him more productive — and happier. He’ll have to figure out how much to travel; the mayor is constantly being invited to conferences out of town. </p>
<p>“I’ve barely left the city in the last year,” he said. </p>
<p>Frey is reading <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/04/522632374/book-examines-17-gatekeepers-into-the-white-houses-inner-workings">“The Gatekeepers,”</a> a 2017 book about White House chiefs of staff and how the structures they put in place have shaped American history. His staff is making flow charts, interviewing job candidates and worrying about how to guard the mayor-elect’s time. Chief of staff Joe Radinovich, who’s been dressed for months in jeans and sweaters, got measured for new clothes.</p>
<p>The transition team, which Frey said is “putting together the boilerplate through which I can make good and informed and engaged decisions quickly,” is co-chaired by Rybak, <a href="http://northsideachievement.org/">Northside Achievement Zone</a> leader Sondra Samuels and Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the <a href="https://www.minneapolisunions.org/">Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation</a>.</p>
<p>As a City Council member, Frey said his goal was to spend 40 percent of his time on “affirmative work” — pushing a policy agenda. His goal as mayor will be to spend 60 percent of his time on affirmative work, and his three top policy priorities are affordable housing, community-police relations and economic inclusion. </p>
<p>Frey said everyone on the new City Council thinks the lack of affordable housing — his first concern as mayor — is a problem that needs to be solved. But the city needs to get better at accomplishing what it sets out to do, he said. Reorganizing the mayor’s office, the city coordinator’s office and the way city department heads and the mayor’s office work together are what he, his staff and transition team are sorting out now. </p>
<p>“There’s values and then there’s execution,” he said. “While I do believe that the city of Minneapolis as an enterprise has very strong values, at times we’ve had the sharpness of a spoon, and we’d like to slice that spoon into an arrowhead.” </p>
<p>Frey and his wife, Sarah Clarke, a lobbyist who’s studying law at night at Mitchell Hamline, are figuring out how to juggle packed schedules, and thinking about having children. They try to grab dinner together every night, and more people stop to speak with them since the election. </p>
<p>“The biggest difference is that it just takes us a while to get anywhere,” Clarke said. </p>
<p>Clarke said that even though she’s had her fill of impromptu discussions of manhole covers or potholes in public, she doesn’t want her husband to be less accessible as mayor. </p>
<p>“That’s something I love about Jacob,” she said. “As his wife, definitely it’s annoying sometimes. But I hope he can keep doing it.” </p>
<p>Frey said he’s had a good concept of what he’s getting into, but he was struck by the briefing he received about the succession of responsibility at City Hall if he were to be incapacitated. </p>
<p>“That’s not something I was briefed on as a council member, let’s put it that way,” Frey said. “Of course there are little tidbits that take a bit to get used to, but this is my dream job. I asked for it.” </p>
<p>Frey’s mayoral staff is mostly hired, and he’s keeping a full schedule. One morning he introduced the new council member in his ward, Steve Fletcher, to constituents over kolaches and coffee at <a href="https://www.kramarczuks.com/">Kramarczuk’s</a>. Another morning he gave a speech honoring outgoing Council Member Blong Yang at City Hall, and looked on as Hodges was honored as well.</p>
<p>Then he left for the groundbreaking for a 26-story apartment building in his neighborhood, on Hennepin Avenue East. Earthmovers and bulldozers growled by as Frey stepped into a heated tent full of well-dressed people and 11 shovels with bronze-colored spades stuck in a pile of loose dirt. </p>
<p>Frey shook hands and laughed, gave a quick speech — he said he kicked some kids off the construction site a few nights ago — and then lined up with several others to wear hard hats and scoop spadefuls of soil into the air for the cameras. </p>
<p>“One, two, three,” he said, helping to synchronize the shovel action. </p>
<p>“Leadership!” someone cracked. </p>

<p>Richard Pitino went to dinner with his family Saturday evening, but the Gophers men’s basketball coach kept checking his phone for any news on point guard Nate Mason. </p>
<p>Mason left in the second half of that afternoon’s victory over Florida Atlantic after injuring his left ankle. He couldn’t put any weight on his leg as he was helped into the locker room. So coaches, fans and teammates feared the worst. </p>
<p>“Any time somebody is struggling to get up, you think of the worst,” sophomore Amir Coffey said. “We all prayed for him that night.” </p>
<p>A magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed no serious damage. The All-Big Ten senior captain should be ready for conference play, and he might return as soon as Saturday, when the Gophers play host to Harvard at Williams Arena. </p>
<p>“I’m hopeful he’ll play,” Pitino said Friday. “If you asked him, he’ll say he’s going to play. We want him ready more than anything.” </p>

<p>The Gophers haven’t played an entire game with their starting backcourt of Mason, Coffey and Dupree McBrayer together and healthy since a Nov. 24 victory over Massachusetts in New York. </p>
<p>The next day, Mason was ejected in the second half of a victory over Alabama, which ended up becoming the infamous 5-on-3 game after the Crimson Tide had its entire bench ejected, then lost two other players. </p>
<p>After the Gophers (11-3) returned home, McBrayer was sidelined for their Nov. 29 loss to Miami (Fla.), when he ended up going to the hospital to receive medication for a right leg infection. McBrayer lost 20 pounds and hasn’t been 100 percent since. He returned briefly before a previous left leg injury resurfaced and caused him to miss the Gophers’ past two games. </p>
<p>“I was kind of down,” McBrayer said. “These guys have been keeping me up and telling me to stay positive … because it hurts when you’re not at 100 percent to perform the way you want to.” </p>
<p>Pitino expects McBrayer to play Saturday. The Gophers need their three starting guards to play at a high level to contend in the Big Ten. Conference play starts up again with two more home games, Wednesday against Illinois and Jan. 6 against Indiana. </p>
<p>“Dupree more than anything, he just needed a break,” Pitino said. “Our trainer looked at the schedule and said we could give him off for Christmas. [The leg injury is] always going to be there, so it’s more monitoring it.” </p>
<p>Mason, who ranks second on the team in scoring (15.5 points per game) and first in assists (4.1), rolled his left ankle when he was bumped going for a steal early in the second half of last week’s 95-60 victory over Florida Atlantic. </p>
<p>At that point, the Georgia native had played arguably his best 21 minutes of the season. Mason scored all of his team-high 17 points in the first half on 5-for-8 shooting from three-point range. </p>
<p>Freshman Isaiah Washington took over to finish with seven points, eight rebounds and three assists in 16 minutes. But there’s nobody on the Gophers roster who can replace Mason. </p>
<p>“It was a big, big sigh of relief, because he’s obviously extremely important to our team,” Pitino said of Mason’s return. “He was playing well.” </p>
<p>Coffey is averaging 14.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists and has made strides from his All-Big Ten freshman season. The Gophers have also seen growth in freshman guards Washington and Jamir Harris, but they are looking forward to being at full strength in the starting backcourt soon. </p>
<p>“When we have a full healthy team we can be pretty dangerous,” Coffey said. “We haven’t had too many games with a full team. Getting a couple guys back will mean a lot, especially going into Big Ten play.” </p>

<p>It has been a year of reckoning for women in the United States. It began with hundreds of thousands of women across the U.S. and the rest of the world marching for women’s rights. It would close out with powerful men like Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein accused of serial sexual harassment and abuse of women — and finally facing consequences for their behavior. </p>
<p>But what has changed for women in 2017, particularly in government and policy? The Trump administration has taken actions on issues that directly affect women, including funding for sex education, how colleges handle sexual assault cases and how some workers can obtain birth control. On the political side, women in the U.S. Senate became key players in dealing with sexual harassment in Congress, while the November election showed early signs of a new wave of women running for office. </p>
<p>“Under President Trump, women, working families and children have seen opportunities expand,” Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. </p>
<p>Among significant changes: </p>
<p>• As one of his first acts as president, Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, otherwise known as the “global gag rule.” The rule, which has been implemented by every Republican president since Ronald Reagan and revoked by every Democratic one since Bill Clinton, bars foreign nongovernmental organizations that perform or discuss abortion from receiving U.S. funding. </p>
<p>“This is a pro-life administration and pro-life president,” said Sanders. “This an issue he campaigned on, advocated for, and was proud to take action on as one of his first acts.” </p>

<p>However, certain groups that focus on diseases from Zika virus to AIDS could lose funding because they also offer family planning services that mention abortion. </p>
<p>The Trump administration notified several grant recipients in the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program that their funding would end in June of 2018, instead of in 2020. The grants went to organizations that would implement “evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs.” </p>
<p>The administration argues that the TPP programs that lost funding were ineffective at preventing teen pregnancy, but the programs had not yet finished their research. </p>
<p>In October, the Trump administration allowed employers to refuse to cover birth control on their insurance plans on religious grounds, a change long sought by conservative groups. The decision sparked immediate legal challenges, and so far it has been blocked in two federal courts. The requirement was a key component of the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p>• In September, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos revoked Obama-era rules for how universities are required to deal with sexual assault, arguing that they went too far in dictating how campuses should handle these incidents. </p>
<p>Under Obama, colleges were required to use a lower standard of proof, “preponderance of evidence,” when investigating a claim. With DeVos’ changes, colleges will have to use “clear and convincing evidence,” a higher standard of proof. Supporters of DeVos’ change said that it makes the process more fair for all students and parties involved in these disputes, while critics argued it would make victims of assault less likely to report. </p>
<p>• Though the ACA was not repealed outright, the Republicans’ new tax bill essentially axed the individual mandate, which was seen as the backbone of the ACA. </p>
<p>The Trump administration sees these changes as positive for women and families. “We believe that more freedom for people to choose more diverse plans with less mandates imposed upon them are good for all consumers, women and men alike,” said White House spokesman Raj Shah. </p>
<p>Some experts believe that such dramatic changes to health care policy could have an adverse impact on women. The precarious future of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, could also impact women and families. The program provides coverage for millions of children whose families make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but can’t afford or access private insurance. The program ran out of funding on Sept. 30, 2017, and has yet to be reauthorized. Congress just injected the program with emergency funds that will last until March, but its future is still in limbo despite broad bipartisan support. </p>
<p>The Republican tax overhaul, which Trump signed into law just before Christmas, includes an expanded child tax credit thanks to a late push from Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah. </p>
<p>• After starting in Hollywood and working its way through the media, the MeToo movement came for Congress. Several members of Congress lost their jobs, including Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn.; Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich.; and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., after allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, said that he would not seek re-election next year after allegations surfaced. </p>
<p>After news organizations revealed the secretive, Byzantine system for reporting sexual harassment on Capitol Hill, female lawmakers led the charge to fix the process. The Me Too Congress Act was introduced in November, aimed at changing the system by which Congress deals with sexual misconduct. The Senate also mandated that all elected officials and their aides would need to undergo anti-sexual harassment training. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has said that the House would mandate similar training. </p>
<p>• Early indications from organizations like EMILY’s List and She Should Run show record interest from women in running for office. </p>
<p>In Virginia’s 2017 elections, 11 new women were elected to the House of Delegates. The number of women in Virginia’s House rose from 17 to 27. </p>
<p>Trump’s first Cabinet has the lowest percentage of women and nonwhite men of any since President Ronald Reagan’s. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, had seven women in his first Cabinet. Trump has four. </p>
<p>• All of these shifts indicate that 2018 will be another year of change for women. “What we saw when it came to women running this year is a little window into what we might see come next year, both in state legislative races and also in congressional races,” said Debbie Walsh of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">People waited to prepay 2018 property taxes in Hennepin County on Wednesday in hopes of having them be deductible in 2017.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Hennepin and Ramsey counties continued Friday to fill their coffers with unanticipated millions in revenue from thousands of residents, who prepaid their 2018 property taxes in hopes of getting a bigger deduction next year. </p>
<p>As of Friday afternoon, Hennepin County had collected $122.2 million in 2018 taxes from more than 16,000 taxpayers — one-fourth of whom paid in person at the Government Center in downtown Minneapolis or by mail. </p>
<p>In comparison, Hennepin received about $6 million in prepayments from fewer than 1,000 taxpayers in all of 2016. </p>
<p>Ramsey County handled 893 prepayments from Tuesday to Thursday, more than twice the number it handled in all of 2016. At Thursday’s end of day, it had recorded 2,119 tax prepayments for 2018 amounting to $12.5 million. </p>
<p>The rush to pay taxes in advance was prompted by the newly enacted federal law that will cap the annual state and local tax deduction at $10,000 as of Jan. 1. That change has created an unprecedented surge in prepayments across the nation. </p>
<p>It still wasn’t clear Friday whether Minnesotans actually will be able to deduct next year’s taxes by paying them off now. But the uncertainty apparently didn’t discourage thousands of eager taxpayers from going ahead and making prepayments anyway. </p>
<p>Hennepin and Ramsey county staffers have been so busy that each county decided to open for in-person payments on Saturday — Hennepin, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the skyway level of the Government Center in downtown Minneapolis; and Ramsey, from 8 a.m. to noon at the Property Tax Services office, 90 Plato Blvd. W., St. Paul. </p>
<p>Both counties also offer prepayment online. </p>
<p>A state Department of Revenue spokesman said Friday that the Internal Revenue Service will determine whether property taxes prepaid in 2017 will be deductible on next year’s federal income tax returns, based on the IRS’ reading of state and local laws. </p>
<p>The IRS has said that what matters is whether property taxes are assessed by the end of 2017, but it wasn’t clear what “assessed” meant. County boards in Hennepin and Ramsey approved gross tax levies this month, but individual property tax bills won’t go out to taxpayers until early 2018. </p>

                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p>The good old days for sports fans are often called that for the simplest of reasons: Those were the good old days. </p>
<p>There has been nonstop bitterness from followers of Gophers men’s hockey over what has become of interest since the team was ordered out of the WCHA and into a six-team (now seven) Big Ten for the winter of 2013-14. </p>
<p>Actually, the good old days were already passed for Gophers men’s hockey, since the WCHA had been bloated to 12 teams, and home-and-home series were no longer guaranteed vs. rivals such as North Dakota and Minnesota Duluth. </p>
<p>One conference came out of the carnage with an outstanding system: the new, eight-team National Collegiate Hockey Conference, with North Dakota and Denver as the main attractions in a league where the weekend series are fierce and with a 24-game schedule that allows home-and-homes vs. almost every team. </p>
<p>There have been fewer complaints from followers of Gophers men’s basketball, since we are much further removed from the good old days of Big Ten hoops. The culprit is the same as in men’s hockey, though — that being the Big Ten Network, and Commissioner Jim Delany’s motivation to serve only that, and neither the fans nor common sense, in scheduling. </p>
<p>The expansion of the basketball conference started with Penn State in the winter of 1992-93. Nebraska arrived for 2011-12. Those two teams tied for last at 4-14 that winter — a symbolic display that these are two programs that have lessened the product offered in men’s basketball. </p>
<p>Maryland and Rutgers were added for the 2014-15 season. Maryland is competitive in men’s basketball, but does any Gophers fan want to trade a visit by the Terps for a home-and-home with Wisconsin or Michigan State? </p>
<p>And Rutgers is inept on every field, every court (0-20 in volleyball, for instance), and it matters not to Delany. </p>
<p>The commissioner has been willing to throw the men’s basketball schedule into full turmoil to continue the mirage that miserable, unloved Rutgers has given the Big Ten legitimate entry into the New York market. </p>
<p>OK, I do have the problem of recalling when the Big Ten was a perfect 10 in men’s basketball. There were five travel partners: Minnesota-Iowa, Indiana-Ohio State, Michigan-Michigan State, Northwestern-Wisconsin and Purdue-Illinois. </p>
<p>Basically, a team would be on the road one weekend (Wednesday or Thursday, and always Saturday) and at home the next. Perfect. </p>
<p>Clem Haskins was in his first season as Gophers coach in 1986-87, and was rebuilding from the basement. They won two games in early January to start the Big Ten and then would lose the last 16. </p>
<p>I was covering a trip to Indiana and Ohio State that started Feb. 19 in Bloomington, Ind. That Hoosiers team would win Bobby Knight’s third NCAA title, but in astounding fashion, the ragtag Gophers played Indiana to the final seconds. </p>
<p>The Gophers were leading late and a loose ball was awarded to them near the Indiana bench. Knight got up and barked obscenities at the referee. The guy ran over to Haskins and said he was changing the call. The ref was so sheepish about bowing down to Knight that Clem wasn’t given a technical when he took off his coat and threw it on the floor. </p>
<p>Indiana used that travesty to win 72-70, and a little over an hour later, the Gophers’ rented bus was starting the 225-mile ride through the night to Columbus, Ohio. </p>
<p>I hitched a ride, and was able to sit across from Clem, and heard in a low voice the amazing stories of his life as a basketball protégé in a Kentucky adjusting to integration. Those four hours in a mostly quiet bus filled with disappointed, gutsy basketball players made me a Clem fan for life. </p>
<p>Maybe that’s the memory that causes loathing for what Delany and his Big Ten Network have done to men’s basketball. </p>
<p>Carry around a schedule because there are 16 games left to be played on every day of the week. There are only seven remaining Big Ten games in the Barn, since one was played in early December and another was stolen by Delany for Madison Square Garden — vs. Ohio State — on Jan. 20. </p>
<p>The Big Ten tournament also will be held in Madison Square Garden. It’s a week early, since the Big East (a 10-team conference splendidly dedicated to basketball) has the March 7-10 dates in New York. </p>
<p>That means the Big Ten regular season ends on the last weekend of February, the tournament ends March 3 and teams such as the Gophers will have a minimum of 12 days off before the start of the NCAA tournament … all for Delany’s Folly. </p>
<p>These are ridiculous days for Big Ten basketball. </p>

<p>A Mound woman whose husband pleaded guilty to bilking investors of more than $1 million has been charged for her role in a Ponzi scheme that funded their lavish lifestyle, federal prosecutors said Friday. </p>
<p>Authorities charged Alex Reaves Lundin, 25, with one felony count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud for her role in the scheme they say was orchestrated by her husband, Jeremy Lundin. </p>
<p>In September, Jeremy Lundin, 30, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of mail fraud and one count of money laundering, both felonies, after a monthslong FBI and IRS investigation into his company, Big Island Capital, Acting U.S. Attorney Gregory Brooker said in a Friday news release. His sentencing date is Feb. 1. </p>
<p>Alex Lundin identified herself as the chief financial officer of Big Island Capital in her LinkedIn resume, authorities say. </p>
<p>According to his guilty plea, Jeremy Lundin admitted to working through a network of associates and friends to solicit at least 51 investors by promising “exponential growth through options trading,” then taking their money to finance personal trips, buy expensive jewelry and purchase a luxury boat. </p>
<p>From December 2014 to May 2017, Jeremy Lundin lured the victims into a false sense of security by misrepresenting the contents of his brokerage account, where Big Island’s assets were meant to be held for safekeeping, according to the criminal complaint. He once claimed the firm’s capital was $730,000 when, in reality, Lundin had not yet even opened the brokerage account. </p>
<p>As part of the scheme, he provided the victim investors with written materials claiming that the goal of Big Island Capital was to “generate profits with options trading.” Although he could not “guarantee” an exact percent, he would “shoot for” returns of between 40 and 80 percent, according to federal prosecutors. </p>
<p>After Alex Lundin learned that her husband was not following through on his promises to investors, she assisted him with the scheme by soliciting new investors and allegedly lying to other investors, telling them that their money was safe. She allegedly did this despite knowing that investor money had gone toward their personal expenses, federal prosecutors said. </p>
<p>In a June interview with the Star Tribune, she denied having anything to do with the company. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The number of fire fatalities in Minnesota this year could climb to 64, after residential fires in Hibbing, Lakeville, Ely and Marshall left seven dead over the long holiday weekend. </p>
<p>If fire is determined to be the cause of death in all four blazes, 2017 will log the highest number of state fire deaths since 2002, said State Fire Marshal Bruce West. </p>
<p>“This year has been a very, very tragic holiday season,” said West, whose office is assisting local authorities in the death investigations. </p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we do get spikes at this time of year between Thanksgiving and New Year’s.” </p>
<p> </p>

<p></p>
<p>In a fire that started early Tuesday, Todd Jacob Gillitzer Jr., 9, and Isaiah Adams, 3, died while sleeping over at their grandparents’ Hibbing home for Christmas. Their grandparents — retired firefighter Steven Gillitzer, 67, and his wife, Patricia Gillitzer, 63 — also died. </p>
<p>Steven Gillitzer had escaped the home safely, but he went back in to try to save his grandchildren. He saved Jonathan Gillitzer, 8, who was found outside the home. </p>
<p>“He got one child out,” West said. “He died rescuing others.” </p>
<p>Isaiah Adams was “quick to hug, full of kisses, ready to sing and dance and always curious as to what was behind that next door,” wrote a family friend on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/isaiah-adams">fundraising </a>site for the boy.</p>
<p>Friends described Todd Jacob Gillitzer on his <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/jacobsfunds">fundraising </a>site as “an amazing boy, so full of life with an unforgettable laugh and smile!”</p>
<p>In Lakeville, Jonathan C. White, 29, was killed when his family’s home was destroyed in the early morning hours Tuesday. His parents were able to escape the blaze. </p>
<p>Melissa White said in an interview that her last memory of her brother Jonathan came only hours before the fire. After Christmas dinner, she said that he showed her an Irish Celtic knot design that he’d fashioned from rope and planned to use for her upcoming wedding. </p>
<p>“He didn’t tell me what he was going to make from that design,” she said. “I gave him a hug that night, said ‘I love you, and I will see you in a few days.’ ” She wrote on the family’s <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/jons-funeralwhite-fire-recovery">fundraising page</a> that words were not enough “to express the heartfelt sorrow that we feel for the passing of son and brother.”</p>
<p>In Marshall, Kent Sikorski, 49, died in a house fire on Christmas Day, according to an announcement in the local newspaper. And in Ely, an unidentified person died in an apartment fire Wednesday afternoon. </p>
<p>The causes of all four fires are under investigation, West said. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Fire escape plan ‘important’</strong></h3>
<p>While fire fatalities have dropped from nearly 100 annually in the 1970s, thanks to better fire prevention and public education, holiday rituals such as cooking, lighting candles, using fireplaces and cranking up space heaters can increase the risk of fire. </p>
<p>“This time of the year can be very tragic, very quickly. Our most common cause of structure fire in Minnesota is cooking and heating,” West said. “Our number one cause of fire fatalities is careless smoking.” </p>
<p>Cooking fires caused 45 percent of all structure fires in 2016, while heating fires — including furnaces, portable space heaters, water heaters and fireplaces — accounted for 10 percent. </p>
<p>West urged residents to check carbon monoxide and smoke detectors and make sure that space heaters are placed 3 feet from bedspreads, curtains and other flammable items. </p>
<p>“Plug that space heater directly into an outlet, no extension cord. Space heaters can be safe if used properly,” West said. </p>
<p>He added that cooks shouldn’t let visitors, phone calls and texts distract them while at the stove. “If you are doing some holiday cooking, stay in the kitchen,” West said. </p>
<p>And he said that every family member should know the fire escape plan for their home. “Practice that escape plan. That fire drill in the home can mean life and death,” he said. </p>
<p>The amount of time needed to escape a house fire has dropped from nearly 30 minutes a generation ago to less than four minutes. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDNPhq5ggoE">video</a> made by the National Institute of Standards and Testing, a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, illustrates the time difference.</p>
<p>“With today’s lightweight construction, the time to escape for a homeowner is significantly less than it was from … older style of homes,” West said. “Today you’ve got three to four minutes. You don’t have a lot of time to get out. That’s why it’s so important to make sure everyone in the home has a fire escape plan. You have to react quickly.” </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">Expect American soccer prodigy Christian Pulisic to leave Borussia Dortmund, his up-and-down German team, for a Premier League club, possibly Liverpool, before his 20th birthday in September.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>In many ways, 2017 was a forgettable year for American soccer fans. The men’s national team endured the embarrassment of failing to qualify for next summer’s World Cup. The women’s national team lost three home games in a year, the first time it had lost more than one home game in a calendar year since 2000. Even the MLS Supporters’ Shield and MLS Cup landed in Canada, with Toronto FC. </p>
<p>As 2018 dawns in the soccer world, here’s a (somewhat pessimistic) look at and a few predictions for the upcoming year. </p>
<p>The World Cup in Russia will, like the 2014 Sochi Olympics, be marred by poor planning and infrastructure problems. But those ills will seem almost quaint given the status of the 2022 World Cup. Migrant workers in host country Qatar have died while building stadiums in a country that is remarkably ill-suited to host soccer in the first place. Argentina will finally overcome Lionel Messi’s big-tournament jinx and take home its first title since 1986, defeating a resurgent France in the final. </p>
<p>Both domestic American leagues will struggle to continue growing. Despite a glitzy new franchise in Los Angeles, the Major League Soccer season will be overshadowed by the lack of American participation in the World Cup, traditionally an entry point for a legion of new American soccer fans. The impending move of the Columbus Crew to Austin, Texas, will also serve as a black eye for the league. The National Women’s Soccer League, meanwhile, has already seen one team (FC Kansas City) fold. Despite the presence of a new team in Salt Lake City, other franchises also will search in vain for long-term viability. </p>
<p>The U.S. Soccer presidential elections in February will see the governing body opt for safety rather than an opportunity for reinvention. The new leader will be either current vice president Carlos Cordeiro or Kathy Carter, current president of Soccer United Marketing, the money behind all of American soccer. </p>
<p>Before he turns 20 in September, American wunderkind Christian Pulisic will leave Borussia Dortmund in Germany for a Premier League destination, after Dortmund’s inconsistent season convinces the youngster that his European future lies elsewhere. Liverpool, with its commitment to attacking soccer, will be the front-runner. That is, as long as the Reds finish in the top four in England and can promise Pulisic a chance to make his mark in the Champions League. </p>
<p>Overall, there are two predictions that are likely to come true every year. The first is that financial concerns, not on-field concerns, will be far too prevalent all over the world. From complaints about TV broadcasters and corruption at FIFA to the unreal amounts of money that uber-rich owners use to buy success, fans will bemoan the power of the almighty pound, dollar and euro. </p>
<p>The second, though, is just as true: Despite the complaints, few of those fans will actually give up on the game they love. </p>
<h4><strong>Short takes</strong></h4>
<p>• The Christmastime standings were not kind to fans of title races, as the championships are all but decided in four of Europe’s big five leagues. Manchester City has won 18 consecutive games and will cruise to the English title. Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain all have leads of nine points or more and should do the same in their respective countries. Only Italy, where one point separates Napoli and Juventus at the top, has a title race. </p>
<p>• Russian World Cup organizing committee chairman Vitaly Mutko has stepped down after the IOC banned him from the Olympics in connection with a doping scandal. FIFA had originally announced that Mutko would continue in his position, but he departed as both the overseer of the Russian soccer governing body and as the head of the World Cup committee, apparently to spare FIFA and Russia further criticism. </p>
<p>• Two South American soccer officials were convicted of racketeering charges in New York in connection with the FIFA bribery scandal. Jose Maria Marin, former president of Brazil’s governing body, and Juan Angel Napout, former president of Paraguay’s, were both convicted of racketeering and wire fraud. The fate of a third defendant, former Peru soccer President Manuel Burga, is yet to be decided. </p>
<p><strong>WEEKEND WATCH GUIDE</strong></p>
<p>Serie A: Sassuolo at Roma, 8 a.m. Saturday, beIN. Roma can’t score right now, with just three goals in its past five matches, and Sassuolo is on a winning streak, culminating last week in a 1-0 victory over formerly league-leading Inter. Expect Roma to depend on its league-best defense, and hope for Edin Dzeko to steal a goal and the victory. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Premier League: Leicester City at Liverpool, 9 a.m. Saturday, NBCSN. Liverpool hasn’t lost a league match since the week before Halloween, but the chase for the top four in England is tight enough that this has barely provided an advantage. Liverpool has scored 12 times in three games and will be tough for Leicester to stop. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Serie A: Lazio at Inter, 11 a.m. Saturday, beIN. Three consecutive losses — two in the league, one in the cup — have Inter searching for something to stop the slide. It’s starting to look like the Serie A title might be out of reach. Now Lazio, four points behind, is gaining on Inter in the race for the Champions League. </p>
<p>Premier League: Southampton at Manchester United, 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Ch. 11. Don’t look now, but Southampton is sliding down toward the relegation zone. It looks more likely that more players will leave in the January transfer window than will arrive. A trip to Old Trafford is never good for a struggling side. </p>

<p>HOUSTON — A man walked into a Houston auto shop where he used to work Friday and fatally shot two employees before going outside and killing himself, police said. </p>
<p>The man, whose name wasn’t immediately released, entered Bemer Plus about 4 p.m. and officers received a call minutes later about “a shooting in progress,” Executive Assistant Police Chief Troy Finner said in a news conference. </p>
<p>Multiple people, including customers and other employees, were at the shop when the shooting happened, Finner said. </p>
<p>“It’s very, very sad this time of year and any part of the year that we lose three citizens,” Finner said. “I just ask our great citizens of this city to pray for each victim here and their families.” </p>
<p>Houston police also didn’t immediately release the names of the two other people who died. The motive for the shooting is not clear. </p>
<p>The southwest Houston shop specializes in used BMW sales and repairs. </p>
<p>Hours after the shooting, homicide detectives were still at the scene investigating. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Tyler Sheehy’s goal in the first period was the game-winner for Minnesota.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By News Services</h4>
<p>Tyler Sheehy scored in the middle of the opening period and Jack Sadek and Leon Bristedt had goals in the third as the Gophers returned from their long holiday break to edge Army 3-0 on Friday night at 3M Arena at Mariucci. </p>
<p>Eric Schierhorn needed to make only 13 saves for the shutout. Jared Dempsey had 30 saves for the Black Knights. </p>
<p>Army (8-9-2) came into this series 2-5-2 in their past nine games. The No. 10 Gophers (10-9-1) had lost five of their past six games. So both teams badly needed a win. </p>
<p>Sheehy gave Minnesota a 1-0 lead at 10 minutes, 1 second of the first with his sixth goal of the season. </p>
<p>Sadek, a defenseman, made it 2-0 Gophers at 16:41 of the final period. It was his second goal this season. Bristedt got an empty-net goal with 42 seconds left. It was his third goal this season. </p>
<p>Both teams went 0-for-4 on the power play. </p>

<p>Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said ahead of his team’s rematch with the Wild on Friday that he was trying to forget the 6-4 blow-up loss the Predators last month at Xcel Energy Center. </p>
<p>“It was a very frustrating loss for us,” he said. “But we’re past that now.” </p>
<p>Unfortunately for Nashville, the Wild was not. </p>
<p>In probably its best start of the season so far, the Wild took down the Central Division leaders 4-2 at home in front of an announced crowd of 19,147. Nashville fell to 22-10-5 while the Wild climbed to 20-15-3. </p>
<p>Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said ahead of the game he just hoped his team would “come out with a lot of energy.” While a four-goal burst in the third period granted the Wild its first victory against last season’s Stanley Cup runner-up back on Nov. 16, this time around, the Wild upheld its coach’s wishes Friday of upgrading its game. </p>

                  The Wild’s Matt Dumba celebrated with teammate Mikael Granlund after Granlund scored the first goal of the game in the first period against the Nashville Predators on Friday

<p>“We realize it’s a divisional game. We realize the differential in points,” Boudreau said. “And if we want to stay with the big boys, we know how important it is for us.” </p>
<p>The Wild outshot Nashville 11-0 to start the game before winger Mikael Granlund grabbed the breakthrough at seven minutes, 34 seconds. Nashville registered its first shot on goal, which goaltender Devan Dubnyk saved in his first game back from injury after missing seven, shortly after that. </p>
<p>Dubnyk ended the game with 41 saves. </p>
<p>“This is a big stretch,” Dubnyk said pregame. “We got the right start against Dallas [on Wednesday], and we’re going to have to keep doing that. We’re not just looking at the Wild Card spot. We want to get up in our Division, and the best way to do that is to beat the teams in your division. So it’s a good opportunity for us here.” </p>
<p>Dubnyk did let Nashville defenseman P.K. Subban’s shot trickle past him at 10:16, but Granlund came to the rescue again, scoring his second at 11:09 on the power play. </p>
<p>The Wild ended up setting a season-high for shots on goal in a period, with the final tally 18-9. And the team didn’t let up in the second period, either. </p>
<p>Center Eric Staal looked to have scored a deflection off defenseman Matt Dumba’s shot less than a minute into the second 20 minutes, but Nashville challenged for goaltender interference on Pekka Rinne and won. Dumba made good on that, though, scoring a bomb at 13:14 to extend the Wild’s lead. </p>
<p>Nashville center Kyle Turris pulled one back at 2:52 of the third period, scoring on the power play. But it wasn’t enough to spur his team’s comeback. While the Wild waned a bit toward the end, with Nashville ultimately winning the shot battle 43-38, both Granlund and defenseman Jared Spurgeon dented the post in attempts to solidify the lead late in the game. </p>
<p>Boudreau didn’t actually see the end of the game, as he left the bench at the 5:44 mark after a puck hit him. He missed Granlund’s hat trick, thanks to an empty-net goal with 50.3 seconds to play. </p>
<p>The Wild face Nashville again, this time at Bridgestone Arena, 7 p.m. Saturday in the finale of a back-to-back, home-and-home series. </p>
<p>“It’s kind of silly to go here and then go home and play the same team again,” Nashville winger Craig Smith said. “But I don’t know, it’s just how it winds up.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A nondescript massage parlor in the heart of Buffalo, Minn., has been the target of a yearlong human trafficking investigation, and authorities say they plan to bring charges soon. </p>
<p>On Dec. 6, eight Buffalo police officers and members of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension raided the Sunshing Spa massage parlor at 404 7th St. NE. </p>
<p>The parlor promoted deep tissue, hot stone and infrared therapies in a sign on its storefront window. </p>
<p>A 53-year-old woman was arrested for solicitation for prostitution, and is suspected of being involved in the operation, said Buffalo Police Chief Pat Budke. Another 52-year-old woman was arrested for disorderly conduct. She is not believed to be involved with the operation. </p>
<p>Both women were interviewed but neither was charged. </p>
<p>Mandy Erickson, a graphic designer who works at Precision Prints nearby, said she saw part of the raid unfold. “We saw six or seven unmarked cars pull up,” she said. Then she saw a policewoman with some handcuffs head for the building. “As soon as I saw an officer, I figured out what was happening,” she said. </p>
<p>“This is a small town,” she said. “People were surprised.” </p>
<p>The massage parlor closed down on the day of the raid and has not opened since. People were seen entering the storefront and hauling away furniture and equipment — some of which was set out on the sidewalk with a sign that said it was free to take. The spa now looks to be completely empty. </p>
<p>Budke predicted charges will likely be filed against the owners, operators and managers, but declined to say when they would be brought. </p>
<p>The spa opened in August 2016 in a small business mall that includes an auto body shop in the back, several other businesses and a picture frame shop in front. Within a couple of months, police received a report of suspicious activity. </p>
<p>“A citizen entered the business and saw employees scantily clad and made a complaint that they suspected something was going on,” Budke said. “They suspected there was sex trafficking.” </p>
<p>The business became the subject of discussion at two Buffalo City Council meetings, Budke said. </p>
<p>“Buffalo is very much a bedroom community,” Budke said. “It has a small-town feel. There is no tolerance on the part of the community for this.” </p>
<p>Doug Selle, owner of Radio-Active Mobile Electronics a short distance away, recalls a customer coming into his store to buy a mobile car starter. He said the customer told him he had seen the massage parlor and thought he’d go over and get a massage while the starter was being installed. </p>
<p>When the customer returned, he told Selle that the massage therapist had propositioned him. </p>
<p>“We had heard rumors about what was going on in there,” said Selle. </p>
<p>With the help of the BCA, Buffalo police launched a probe that included undercover work and surveillance. </p>
<p>The nature of the investigation is difficult, said Budke, because the massage therapists engaging in prostitution are viewed as the victims, not the target of criminal charges. </p>
<p>“The focus has to be the people who are running the trafficking,” he said. “It takes time to build enough intelligence to do a search warrant.” </p>
<p>The search warrant has been sealed, but Budke said officers were looking for information that included “financial documentation, who’s running the business, what’s the nature of the business, where is the money coming, where is the money going.” </p>
<p>The two women who were arrested could not be reached for comment. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">An ATV recently went through the ice on Medicine Lake. Ice needs to be 5 to 7 inches thick to support ATVs or snowmobiles.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>An unseasonably warm December wasn’t doing any favors for east-metro ice fishing enthusiasts, a group of folks often willing to hit the ice after only a few days of freezing temperatures. Weeks of warm weather meant lots of open water and few fish houses in Washington County. </p>
<p>Until Christmas week, that is. </p>
<p>While state and local officials caution that no ice should be considered totally safe, a blast of arctic air in the days leading up to Christmas was probably enough to get anglers back on Washington County ice in search of fish. </p>
<p>And rising temperatures in the mid-20s, with lows in the single digits, may mean a better and safer platform for ice fishing, said Pete Boulay, a climatologist with the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR). But he won’t guarantee it. </p>
<p>“We are never going to say, ‘OK, now the ice is safe,’ ” Boulay said last week. “It all depends on the forecast, whether there’s a storm or not, whether it’s cold or not. </p>
<p> </p>
<div> <div>

			</div>
								</div>
<p></p>
<p>“What we need for good ice formation is the lack of snow cover on the ice and preferably nights below zero.” </p>
<p>It certainly wasn’t looking hopeful during the couple weeks before Christmas. Several days of temperatures that climbed into the 40s chased people off what little ice there was on Lake Elmo, Big Marine Lake and White Bear Lake, and for good reason, said Lisa Dugan, recreation safety outreach coordinator for the DNR. </p>
<p>Dugan stressed that anyone venturing out on the ice should be prepared, not only by carrying something to help pull yourself out of the water — such as a couple screwdrivers or long nails — but also by wearing a life jacket whether you’re “on foot, on a snowmobile or an [all-terrain vehicle].” </p>
<p>Ice on rivers, such as the St. Croix, can be especially tricky. Two weeks ago, she said, the rivers were completely ice-free. </p>
<p>“A lot of counties are warning people to not even go out on foot because of weather fluctuations,” she said. </p>
<p>The DNR says ice thickness must reach 4 inches before it is safe for walking or ice fishing, 5 to 7 inches to support a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle (ATV), 8 to 12 inches for a car or small pickup and 12 to 15 inches for a medium-size truck. </p>
<p>The best way to tell if ice is safe is to drill it with an auger or chip it with an ice pick, then use a measuring tape to get an accurate depth. </p>
<p>It’s best to check every 150 feet as depths can change from point to point, Dugan said. Or, she added, you can ask people coming off the lake where the trouble spots are. Asking about ice conditions at a local bait shop or lakeside resort is a good step too, she said. </p>
<p>Five people have died in Minnesota after crashing through the ice so far this winter, she said. That compares to two statewide fatalities for the entire previous winter season and none the year before that, Dugan said. All five fatalities this season were people going through the ice on snowmobiles or ATVs. </p>
<p>Jake Willis, state conservation officer for the DNR’s Maplewood Station, said the cold snap that started just before Christmas certainly helped. But the watchword continues to be caution. </p>
<p>“For me, personally, I want a solid week of 20s,” he said. “But it’s not just air temperature. The effect of [ultraviolet] rays, the sun beating down, also can make the ice inconsistent. On a sunny day, it may be 30, but it feels like 35 or 38.” </p>
<p>Even though it’s likely that last week’s frigid temperatures thickened the ice, Willis advised eager folks to “hold your horses. There’s no fish worth going under the ice for.” </p>
<p>Dugan agreed. “You will never regret waiting a little bit longer,” she said. </p>

        <title>North/East metro news briefs: Washington County commissioners hand out some raises, turn down their own</title>
        <updated>2017-12-29T22:53:00-06:00</updated>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>Washington County commissioners, in a recent unanimous vote, declined to give themselves a salary raise in 2018 for the eighth consecutive year. </p>
<p>“It’s not that we don’t deserve one, it’s just that we elect not to take one,” said Commissioner Gary Kriesel of Stillwater, the County Board’s longest-serving member. </p>
<p>Washington County commissioners are paid $52,713 annually, far below their peers in some other metro counties. </p>
<p>Commissioners, however, approved a 7.5 percent raise for County Attorney Pete Orput, putting his salary at $171,580 and bringing it more in line with those of county attorneys in Dakota, Ramsey and Anoka counties. </p>
<p>Orput’s initiatives this year included his front-line response to Minnesota sex trafficking and numerous community seminars, such as internet safety for families, commissioners said. </p>
<p>Dan Starry, who was appointed sheriff in May after Bill Hutton retired, received a 3 percent increase to $153,876. His record in 2017 included crisis intervention training for deputies and correctional officers, an internship program and completion of an upgrade in jail security monitoring. </p>
<p>Molly O’Rourke, completing her sixth year as the county administrator, will be paid $176,344, a 3 percent hike over 2017. </p>
<p>“Her leadership brings out the best in everyone,” said Commissioner Stan Karwoski, turning to O’Rourke. “You’re the right leader for the right county.” </p>

<h4>New Hope </h4>
<h4>Police station, City Hall project get final OK </h4>
<p>A long campaign to build a new police station and City Hall in New Hope cleared a key hurdle this month. </p>
<p>In a 4-1 vote during their Dec. 11 meeting, City Council members approved the low bid of $14.8 million from Terra General Contractors for the project’s construction work. </p>
<p>Construction may begin as early as January, with plans first to demolish the outdoor pool at the chosen site on the Civic Center campus off Xylon Avenue N. </p>
<p>City officials, who have been looking into police department and City Hall space needs since 2013, formed a task force in 2015 to provide feedback. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Hannah Covington </p>
<h4>Anoka County </h4>
<h4>Palumbo honored by county attorney group </h4>
<p>Anoka County Attorney Tony Palumbo this month received a top honor from the Minnesota County Attorneys Association. </p>
<p>Palumbo was chosen for the Johnson Distinguished Service Award, which he received on Dec. 7 at the association’s awards banquet. The service award is given annually to a county attorney with “a history of significant leadership.” </p>
<p>In nominating him for the award, Palumbo’s peers wrote that he is well-known for his expertise in Minnesota’s data practices and his work in protecting the elderly. </p>
<p>Palumbo has been Anoka County attorney since 2011, after working 31 years as an assistant county attorney. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Hannah Covington </p>
<h4>Stillwater </h4>
<h4>Grants awarded to four local organizations </h4>
<p>The Stillwater Area Foundation made four recent grants to local programs. They are: </p>
<p>• $5,000 to Stillwater Area High School, to purchase equipment for high-achieving students to conduct water quality testing on Brown’s Creek; </p>
<p>• $4,200 to the Middle St. Croix Watershed Management Organization, which protects and preserves groundwater storage and retention, for an “adopt-a-rain-garden” program to help maintain Stillwater’s 100-plus rain gardens; </p>
<p>• $2,100 to Canvas Health, an Oakdale nonprofit that helps children, adolescents, adults and families who struggle with mental health, chemical health, and domestic and sexual abuse. The grant will be used to train staff members on how substance abuse and mental illness interact; </p>
<p>• $750 to Our Community Kitchen, to fund a healthy eating class for parents of children living in poverty. The funds will pay for ingredients, journals, cookbooks and instructors. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Kevin Giles </p>
<h4>Brooklyn Center </h4>
<h4>Summit on invasive species scheduled </h4>
<p>The Aquatic Invaders Summit, a workshop focused on protecting Minnesota’s lakes and rivers from invasive species, will be held Feb. 28-March 1 in Brooklyn Center. </p>
<p>The two-day event, to be held at the Earle Brown Heritage Center, will include sessions on using native pathogens to kill carp and possibly zebra mussels; how the state Department of Natural Resources has made zebra mussel-sniffing dogs part of its enforcement efforts; whether the state should create freshwater conservation areas to protect lakes; and what anglers can do to limit the spread of invasive species. </p>
<p>A keynote address on climate impacts and invasive species, followed by a panel discussion, will be given by Don Shelby, former WCCO-TV news anchor and reporter. Those unable to attend in person will be able to follow the event via livestreaming. </p>
<p>Registration is open and early bird discounts are available. For more information, go to aissummit3.mnlakesandrivers.org/about. </p>

<h4>Cottage GROVE </h4>
<h4>Firefighters donate winter coats to kids </h4>
<p>The Cottage Grove Fire Department and the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 2570 Union recently donated more than 60 new coats to South Washington County Schools students in need. </p>
<p>The coats were distributed before winter break to students with the highest needs through SoWashCo CARES (Community Action Reaching Every Student). </p>
<p>Firefighter and paramedic Christy Kreminski organized the fundraiser, through the department, to buy the coats through Operation Warm, a national nonprofit organization. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Most Sundays, just 50 to 60 people gather to worship in Community of Christ’s sanctuary in Apple Valley. But on a Tuesday in December, dozens of new faces wandered through the church, resting, munching on pizza and escaping the deep freeze outside. </p>
<p>The church is the latest stop for a homeless shelter for single adults, which rotates among six south metro congregations. </p>
<p>“The faith community has really stepped up,” said Madeline Kastler, Dakota County housing manager. </p>
<p>The roving shelter was formed in December 2016 as an emergency solution to bring the county’s homeless in from the elements. This year’s effort is well-planned and deliberate, county staff said. It’s run by professional staff from <a href="http://matrixhousingservices.org/">Matrix Housing Services</a>, a Minneapolis nonprofit, under a $45,000 contract with the county. Some 150 trained volunteers help with daily tasks.</p>
<p>Dakota County allotted about $250,000 toward shelter operations in its 2018 budget, Matrix staff members said. The shelter will park in each location for up to four weeks, then move on. </p>
<p>Unlike last winter, when families were welcome, only adults and their pets can use the shelter this year. So far, two dogs, a cat and a parakeet have stayed. </p>

<p>Charlie Curry, a Church of Christ member and liaison to the shelter staff, said the congregation felt compelled to participate. “It’s a matter of social justice and it’s about values,” Curry said. “I’m a bit surprised at the size of the problem.” </p>
<p>The shelter, which accommodates up to 50 people, started Nov. 1 and will close April 1. Since it opened, 90 people have used it — about two-thirds of them men, with a median age of 40. They stayed an average of two weeks. The shelter provides meals, a place to sleep and to shower, and connects shelter users with county resources. Each time it moves to a new location, staff members arrange transportation for their guests. </p>
<p>The county has ongoing problems with homeless adults driven by a dearth of affordable housing that has left some residents sleeping in cars or camping outside until temperatures become dangerously cold. County staff says an “incredibly low” rental housing vacancy rate — less than 2 percent — has driven up the price of rental units, making them less affordable if they are available at all. </p>
<p>The shelter’s six locations this winter are Community of Christ and Grace Lutheran Church, both in Apple Valley, Augustana Lutheran Church and St. Stephen’s Lutheran Church, both in West St. Paul, The Well, a United Methodist Church in Rosemount and Easter Lutheran Church in Eagan. The shelter doesn’t yet have a location during a two-week span in February. </p>
<p>When people arrive, Matrix staff determines what they need and whether they have connections in Dakota County through school, work or family. If they don’t, staff tries connect them with their home counties. </p>
<p>“This shelter is for Dakota County community members, so we really try to make sure there’s a tie there,” said Subi Ambrose, Matrix Services’ executive director. </p>
<p>A more intensive screening session later helps the shelter residents find jobs, housing, medical care and other necessities. </p>
<p>As they lounged on their mats in the Community of Christ gymnasium, Alex Field, 25, and Jason Bealka, 22, said the shelter has helped them get re-established. </p>
<p>The pair graduated from Simley High School in Inver Grove Heights. They’ve been a couple for six years and have a 4-year-old son. For the past 18 months or so, they’ve struggled to keep a roof over their heads. </p>
<p>“We were bouncing around from couches to people’s houses,” Field said. “Our family pretty much thinks that we’re adults and we have to do it on our own.” </p>
<p>Now, they have jobs, plan to get a car and will move into a townhouse Jan. 8, with help from a U.S. Housing and Urban Development program that keeps their rent at 30 percent of their income. </p>
<p>Bealka said the shelter and the links to services it provides have motivated him to move forward with his life, instead of feeling hopeless. </p>
<p>“This stuff, it can happen to anybody,” Field said. “We didn’t have jobs, a vehicle, a home. We started from ground zero.” </p>
<p>Ambrose, said she’s seen shelter residents make positive changes. </p>
<p>“If they have affordable housing and a safe place to sleep, they can help themselves,” Ambrose said. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By SETH BORENSTEIN — Associated Press</h4>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — North America couldn’t catch a break in 2017. Parts of the United States were on fire, underwater or lashed by hurricane winds. Mexico shook with back-to-back earthquakes. The Caribbean got hit with a string of hurricanes. </p>
<p>The rest of the world, however, was spared more than usual from the drumbeat of natural catastrophes. Preliminary research shows there were fewer disasters and deaths this year than on average, but economic damages were much higher. </p>
<p>While overall disasters were down, they smacked big cities, which were more vulnerable because of increased development, said economist and geophysicist Chuck Watson of the consulting firm Enki Research. </p>
<p>In a year where U.S. and Caribbean hurricanes set a record $215 billion in damages, according to insurance giant Munich Re, no one in the continental U.S. died from storm surge, which traditionally is the No. 1 killer during hurricanes. Forecasters gave residents plenty of advance warning during a season where storms set records for strength and duration. </p>
<p>“It’s certainly one of the worst hurricane seasons we’ve had,” National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini said. </p>
<p>The globe typically averages about 325 disasters a year, but this year’s total through November was less than 250, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the University of Louvain in Belgium. They included flooding and monsoons in South Asia, landslides in Africa, hurricane in Ireland, and cyclones in Australia and Central America. Colombia experienced two different bouts of floods and mudslides. </p>
<p>Disasters kill about 30,000 people and affect about 215 million people a year. This year’s estimated toll was lower — about 6,000 people killed and 75 million affected. </p>
<p>Was it random chance, statistical quirk or better preparedness? Experts aren’t certain, but say perhaps it’s a little bit of each. </p>
<p>“This has been a particularly quiet year,” said Debarati Guha-Sapir who heads the disaster research center. “The thing is not to be … complacent about this.” </p>
<p>But quiet depends on where you live. </p>
<p>The U.S. had gone more than a decade without a Category 3 storm or larger making landfall on the mainland. The last few Septembers — normally peak hurricane month — had been record quiet until this year when Harvey, Irma, Jose and later Maria popped up and grew to super strength in no time, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. </p>
<p>“September was just bonkers. It was just one after the other, you couldn’t catch a break,” he said. </p>
<p>There were six major Atlantic hurricanes this year; the average is 2.7. A pair of recent studies found fingerprints of man-made global warming were all over the torrential rains from Harvey that flooded Houston. </p>
<p>Researchers at the University of South Carolina estimated that economic damages from this year’s disasters, adjusted for inflation, were more than 40 percent higher than normal, mostly because of Harvey, Irma and Maria. By many private measures, Harvey overtook Katrina as the costliest U.S. hurricane, but the weather service hasn’t finished its calculations yet. </p>
<p>Much of the damage and deaths — storm surge and otherwise — from hurricanes striking the Caribbean are still unknown. The National Hurricane Center hasn’t finished tallying its data. </p>
<p>Uccellini of the weather service said warmer than normal waters and unusual steering currents made the hurricanes especially damaging, combined with booming development in disaster-prone areas. </p>
<p>“We are building in the wrong places. We are building in areas that are increasing in risks,” said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. </p>
<p>Wildfires blazed nearly year-round in the U.S. fanned by relentless winds and parched conditions. Some 9.8 million acres of land have burned, mostly in the West, nearly 50 percent more than the average in the past decade. A wildfire that ignited in early December in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties northwest of Los Angeles grew to be the largest in California history. </p>
<p>Scientists connect drier weather after heavy rains — leading to buildup of fuel that can catch fire and burn easily — to a combination of both man-made warming and a natural La Nina, the climate phenomenon that’s the flip side to El Nino, said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb. </p>
<p>Worldwide significantly fewer people and less land were affected by drought this year, and extreme heat waves were less severe compared to the past. </p>
<p>Landslides were more frequent and deadlier this year, mostly because of the Sierra Leone landslide that killed 915 people, Guha-Sapir said. </p>
<p>Earthquakes worldwide were dramatically down. As of mid-December, there had been only seven earthquakes of magnitude 7 or larger compared to a normal year of about 15. Two powerful quakes struck Mexico in September including one that hit on the anniversary of the devastating 1985 Mexico City quake. </p>
<p>The back-to-back Mexico quakes were unrelated, said geophysicist Ross Stein of Temblor, Inc., a company that provides information about seismic risk. </p>
<p>“We have to remember that coincidences really do happen,” he said. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The State Department has released emails from Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, that were found by the FBI on her husband’s laptop. </p>
<p>Some of the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner’s laptop were marked classified. It was unclear whether they were deemed classified at the time they were sent or when the State Department was preparing them for release. </p>
<p>The emails were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. </p>
<p>The State Department said it “carefully reviews the content of records requested through FOIA to determine whether any information is sensitive or classified,” and some of the documents released Friday have “classified information that has been redacted.” </p>
<p>The FBI found thousands of emails exchanged between Clinton and Abedin while searching Weiner’s laptop as part of a criminal investigation into his sexting with a high school student. The discovery led then-FBI Director James Comey to announce in late October 2016, as Clinton’s run for the White House was in its final stage, that he was reopening the probe of her use of a private computer server. </p>
<p>Then two days before Election Day, the FBI declared there was nothing new in the emails. Clinton has called Comey’s intervention “the determining factor” in her defeat. </p>
<p>The FBI has since said that only a small number of the emails found on the laptop had been forwarded while most had simply been backed up from electronic devices, including most of the email chains containing classified information. Comey said the FBI had concluded that neither Weiner nor Abedin had committed a crime in their handling of the email. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>MADISON, Wis. — Some Wisconsin dairy experts say farmers should take a closer look at their contracts as an oversupply of milk is straining the market. </p>
<p>Agriculture attorney Troy Schneider told Wisconsin Public Radio that contracts between dairy farmers and milk buyers are usually informal. He says farmers have not had to worry about producing too much milk because buyers were easy to find. </p>
<p>However, an oversupply of milk has changed the market and local producers don’t have flexibility. </p>
<p>More than 50 farmers in the state struggled to find new buyers earlier this year after being dropped by Grassland Dairy Products. Schneider said Grassland was the biggest example of how milk oversupply is affecting the relationship between producers and processors. </p>
<p>“Milk plants and milk cooperatives trying to get a control on the overproduction right now and the oversupply, that’s commonplace,” Schneider said. “The mechanism that Grassland used to do so probably was the thing that got more attention, but the problem is universal through all milk purchasers right now.” </p>
<p>Shelly Mayer is the executive director of the group Professional Dairy Producers. She said the situation was a wakeup call for dairy farmers. </p>
<p>Schneider advises that contracts should include an amount farmers expect to produce to ensure their milk has a market. </p>
<p>“Farmers can deal with change, but that change has to be more gradual than sudden,” Schneider said. “There has to be some supply management occurring but the methodology used has to be well-thought-through.” </p>
<p>However, Mayer disagreed and said managing milk production is the best way to address oversupply. She also said more communication between farmers and their buyers can help. </p>
<p>“It’s even more important in these difficult economic times for dairy farmers so that you know what your processor’s needs are, your customers up the chain, what their expectations are,” Mayer said. “But also that dairy farm families know that they can count on these partners in their business.” </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By DAVID EGGERT — Associated Press</h4>
<p>LANSING, Mich. — While the city of Flint still recovers from a lead-tainted water crisis, Michigan is scrambling to combat potential health risks in other tap water that stem from chemicals long used in firefighting, waterproofing, carpeting and other products. </p>
<p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have been detected at military bases, water treatment plants and, most recently, an old industrial dump site for footwear company Wolverine World Wide. The contaminants, classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as “emerging” nationally, have sparked enough concern that Gov. Rick Snyder created a state response team and approved $23 million in emergency spending. </p>
<p>The chemicals do not break down easily and can migrate from soil to groundwater. They were used in scores of U.S. industrial applications and have been detected in human and animal blood around the globe. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says scientists are uncertain about how they affect human health at exposure levels typically found in food and water. But some studies suggest the chemicals might affect fetal development, disrupt hormonal functions, damage fertility and immune systems, and boost the risk of cancer. </p>
<p>At least 1,000 homes with private wells in the Plainfield Township area north of Grand Rapids — near where Wolverine dumped hazardous waste decades ago — have been tested for PFAS contamination in recent months. </p>
<p>Cody Angell, 28, who lives in the area, said he has had “sleepless nights,” even though his home is on the local water system that has been deemed safe. He’s concerned because the chemicals have been discovered in the municipal supply, and Plainfield Township for years pulled water from backup wells that have tested positive for the substances. He wonders if PFAS contamination caused his mother’s thyroid disease. </p>
<p>Angell said he lacks confidence in state regulators, pointing to their failures that led to Flint’s crisis. Environmental activist and legal consultant Erin Brockovich recently met with area residents, urging them to join a class-action lawsuit that alleges Wolverine illegally disposed of PFAS from Minnesota-based 3M’s Scotchgard product in the area. The suit seeks financial damages and steps such as targeted, more frequent medical testing. </p>
<p>Another lawsuit alleges that a family of four living near Wolverine’s unlined tannery waste dump drank highly contaminated well water for 17 years, causing the father to develop colon cancer, the mother to have a miscarriage and one of their children to develop a rare bone cancer. </p>
<p>The chemicals have been identified at 28 sites in 14 Michigan communities. Nearly half are on or near military installations, where the source is believed to be firefighting foam. </p>
<p>The $23 million will be used to hire new state employees to sample and analyze well water, buy lab equipment and help public health departments with unexpected response costs. Samples have been sent to California because no Michigan labs can test for the chemicals; state officials want quicker results. </p>
<p>“People are starting to get an understanding of a whole class of chemicals that … are in so many things. How much of that is getting into our systems? I don’t think people really know,” said state Rep. Chris Afendoulis, a Republican whose district includes the Wolverine dump area. He warned it could become “a nationwide problem.” </p>
<p>Of about 1,050 homes tested in neighborhoods north of Grand Rapids, 74 had PFAS levels above 70 parts per trillion — the U.S. government’s combined health advisory level for two PFAS in drinking water, set in 2016. Some houses had concentrations measuring hundreds of times higher than the lifetime advisory level. Results are not back yet for every home. Wolverine has provided affected residents with bottled water and whole-house filters and, at the state’s request, is investigating 20 reports of discarded barrels or leather scraps at five sites. </p>
<p>For now, the Snyder administration and majority Republicans in the Legislature are comfortable with the 70 parts per trillion standard — a non-enforceable and unregulated limit unlike the federal restrictions on other contaminants such as lead, asbestos and mercury. </p>
<p>“It is largely used for trying to communicate to the public the point at which if you’re below that, we don’t have public health concern. When you get above that, then that is when we start to say there are some people who may be at risk of harm from a lifetime of drinking levels above 70,” said Kory Groetsch, environmental health director at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “I like to think of it as a speed limit. If you’re doing 58 in a 55, your chance of anything bad is very small. If you’re doing 95 in a 55, your chance of something going wrong is quite high.” </p>
<p>Michigan Democrats are proposing legislation to establish a 5 parts per trillion limit, which would be the country’s toughest and follow states such as New Jersey, Minnesota and Vermont that have imposed stricter guidelines. They also are calling for legislative oversight hearings to investigate whether Wolverine and the state moved too slowly to protect people. On its website, Wolverine calls the federal advisory level “very conservative” and says there is no human study proving PFAS exposure causes illness. </p>
<p>Still, the EPA recently announced a “cross-agency effort” to address PFAS contamination nationwide, saying it will identify near-term actions to help communities, enhance coordination, boost research and expand communication about health risks. Snyder, a Republican, said the state is building a “good working relationship” with the EPA, but — echoing criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress — said he wants a “better response” from the Defense Department. </p>
<p>The former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in northern Michigan has been on officials’ radar for some time. While PFAS levels in samples from private residential wells nearby were not higher than the federal advisory level, the state urged people to not use their water for drinking or cooking because of uncertainty about the duration or amount of previous exposure and other concerns. </p>
<p>“We’re at this point in dialogue with different branches of military, and it’d be good if we could get the Department of Defense to figure out the best way to respond and partner with us on helping address this issue,” Snyder said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>NEW YORK — The daughter of key Black Lives Matter figure Eric Garner died Saturday after a weeklong hospital stay following a heart attack. </p>
<p>“She was a warrior to the end. She stood up for justice for her father,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said in announcing the death of Garner, 27, at a New York hospital. </p>
<p>Garner’s official Twitter account, run by her family and friends since she became ill, asked that she be remembered as a mother, daughter, sister and aunt with a heart “bigger than the world.” </p>
<p>In 2014, her father, Eric Garner, who was black, was stopped on Staten Island for selling untaxed cigarettes and died after a white police officer subdued him with a chokehold. A grand jury declined to indict the officer; the city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. </p>
<p>Garner’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” became a slogan for activists. </p>
<p>Erica Garner became a voice for police accountability after his death, criticizing Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio over policing matters. In 2016, she campaigned on behalf of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, for president. </p>
<p>Garner’s mother, Esaw Snipes, told The New York Times previously that Garner, who gave birth four months ago, had learned during the pregnancy that she had heart problems. </p>
<p>Snipes said Garner had a heart attack after an asthma episode and was placed in a medically induced coma. </p>

        <title>New California laws cover immigration, marijuana, education</title>
        <updated>2017-12-30T10:50:00-06:00</updated>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By DON THOMPSON — Associated Press</h4>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California state lawmakers in 2017 passed nearly 900 bills that Gov. Jerry Brown then signed into law. Most of them take effect Monday. The new laws cover topics ranging from the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, to the state’s new recreational cannabis market, to the price of a college education. </p>
<p>Here are some of the laws taking effect with the new year: </p>
<h4>IMMIGRATION </h4>
<p>Police will no longer be able to ask people about their immigration status or participate in federal immigration enforcement actions under a law making California a sanctuary state. The law also allows jail officials to transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities only if they have been convicted of certain crimes. </p>
<p>It was among numerous bills designed to thwart the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration. </p>
<p>Also starting Monday, immigration officials will need a warrant to access workplaces or employee records and landlords will be barred from disclosing tenants’ citizenship. Another new law will prohibit university officials from cooperating with immigration officers. </p>
<p>An additional bill will bar law enforcement officials from detaining a crime victim or witness only because of an actual or suspected immigration violation, or turning them over to immigration authorities without a warrant. </p>
<h4>CANNABIS </h4>
<p>Sales of recreational marijuana will be legal under a 2016 voter initiative that created the nation’s biggest legal drug market. </p>
<p>But it will be illegal to take and drive a under bill taking effect Jan. 1 that outlaws smoking and ingesting marijuana, just as it’s already unlawful for drivers or passengers to drink alcohol while driving. A separate law that took effect in June bars the possession of open containers of cannabis while driving. </p>
<h4>ON THE JOB </h4>
<p>The state minimum wage will increase to $10.50 per hour for businesses with 25 or fewer employees and to $11 per hour for those with 26 or more employees. </p>
<p>Small businesses with between 20 and 49 people will have to offer 12 weeks of unpaid maternity and paternity leave to employees. </p>
<p>Employers can’t ask job applicants about their past salaries, a measure designed to narrow the pay gap between men and women. </p>
<p>California will become the 10th state to require both public- and private-sector employers of five or more employees to delay background checks and inquiries about job applicants’ conviction records until they have made a conditional job offer, a measure known as “ban the box.” </p>
<p>Those arrested but not convicted of a crime may ask a judge to seal their records, a move advocates say will help them get hired. </p>
<h4>HEALTH-RELATED </h4>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies must give advance notice before big price increases, although a drugmakers’ trade group is suing to block the measure. </p>
<p>It will be illegal to deny admission to long-term care facilities based on gender identity or sexual orientation or to repeatedly fail to use a resident’s preferred name or pronoun. </p>
<h4>CLIMATE CHANGE </h4>
<p>Old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs will start disappearing from shelves because they can no longer meet energy efficiency standards under a 2007 federal law. That leaves compact fluorescent lights or light-emitting diode bulbs under the regulations, which take effect nationwide in 2020. The federal law let California impose the higher standards two years early. Although the industry is fighting the change in court, a federal judge is letting the restriction take effect while the case continues. </p>
<h4>EDUCATION </h4>
<p>The first year of community college may be free for full-time, in-state students under a law that waives the $46 per unit fee for one academic year for first-time students. Lawmakers still must provide the money in the next budget. California follows Tennessee in creating the program, though California previously offered free tuition until 1984. </p>
<p>Public schools must test yearly for lead in their water supplies under a law passed in response to problems in San Ysidro schools. </p>
<p>Students in grades 7-12 must be taught about sexual abuse and human trafficking prevention. </p>
<p>Schools will be prohibited from “lunch shaming,” or publicly denying lunch to students or providing a snack instead because their parents haven’t paid meal fees. </p>
<p>Public schools serving low-income students in grades 6 to 12 must provide free tampons and menstrual products in half of restrooms. </p>
<h4>FIREARMS </h4>
<p>Ammunition purchased in another state, online or through a catalog can’t be brought into California except through a licensed ammunition dealer under Proposition 63, approved by voters in 2016. The initiative also sets a new process and deadlines for gun owners to give up their weapons if they are convicted of a felony or certain violent misdemeanors. </p>
<p>Superintendents can no longer allow people with permits to carry concealed guns on school grounds under a separate new law. Only about five school districts previously had such policies. </p>
<h4>CRIMINAL JUSTICE </h4>
<p>Repeat drug offenders will no longer automatically get an additional three years added to their sentences. </p>
<p>Criminals who videotape or stream their crimes on social media could face longer sentences under a law that allows judges to consider the recordings as aggravating factors in sentences for certain violent crimes. </p>
<p>Officials must consider paroling inmates who are age 60 or older and have served at least 25 years under a law that largely mirrors a 2014 federal court order designed to help reduce prison overcrowding. </p>
<p>Intentionally transmitting the AIDS-causing virus HIV is being reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor, the same punishment as transmitting other communicable diseases. </p>
<h4>JUVENILE OFFENDERS </h4>
<p>California inmates serving life sentences for crimes they committed as juveniles will get the chance to leave prison after 25 years, making state law conform to recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions. </p>
<p>Another bill expands California’s youthful parole program to age 25. State law already required that inmates who were under 23 when they committed their crimes be considered for parole after serving at least 15 years. </p>
<p>Families of youths in the juvenile justice system won’t be charged fees that advocates say many can’t afford to pay under a separate law. Another will require offenders age 15 or younger to consult with attorneys before waiving their rights. </p>
<p>One more bill will require that records be sealed for dismissed juvenile court petitions or after a juvenile completes a diversion program, while another will let a judge seal juvenile records even for serious or violent offenses after the offender has completed the sentence. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles police officer has been shot in an ambush attack but she’s expected to recover. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department says the officer, a recent graduate of the police academy, was shot while patrolling with her training officer shortly before 10 p.m. Friday in the Rampart area. </p>
<p>Police tell KCBS-TV that they had stopped someone for what’s termed a “minor infraction” when shots rang out from a distance. </p>
<p>Police Chief Charlie Beck on Saturday called it “an unprovoked and cowardly attack.” </p>
<p>The officer was shot in the thigh and is in stable condition at a hospital. </p>
<p>Beck says she’s in “remarkably good spirits.” </p>
<p>The LAPD says a 28-year-old man was arrested and a gun was seized. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Mickey Mouse. Nick Saban. Any Other Republican. </p>
<p>Those were some of names that got write-in votes in the Alabama Senate election as voters suggested their own alternatives to Sen.-elect Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race. </p>
<p>An unusually high number of voters — 22,852 people, or 1.6 percent of the 1.3 million people who went to the polls — opted for a write-in candidates, sometimes showing their humor and frustration along the way. “Anyone Else,” ”Neither,” and “Any Other Republican” were among the written submissions. </p>
<p>Many of the submission were more serious as some voters followed the lead of Sen. Richard Shelby, who said he could not vote for Moore and was instead writing in the name of another Republican. </p>
<p>Outgoing Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to the post, but lost the GOP primary to Moore, was the top write-in candidate in a majority of counties. State election officials did not tally statewide numbers on write-in candidates, but numbers submitted by counties showed that Strange received more than 7,500 votes — roughly a third of the write-in ballots. </p>
<p>He was followed by retired Marine Col. Lee Busby, former aide to White House chief of staff John Kelly. He was the top vote-getter in at least 10 counties. </p>
<p>Other names frequently listed as write-ins were Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Saban, the University of Alabama football coach. </p>
<p>Alabama election officials stressed ahead of the election that voters had to write-in the name of a living person in order for the vote to be tallied. That did not stop votes for Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, SpongeBob Square Pants, Ronald Reagan, Jesus and UR Mom. </p>
<p>Moore was dogged throughout the election by accusations of sexual misconduct with teens several decades ago when he was a prosecutor in his 30s. At least one person voted by write-in for Leigh Corfman, one of the women who first raised an allegation against Moore. </p>
<p>Someone else voted for Sassy, the name of the horse that Moore rides to the polls on Election Day. </p>
<p>Other voters gave nods to another woman they perceived as being wronged in the world of state politics: Dianne Bentley, who divorced former Gov. Robert Bentley amid accusations that he was having an affair with an aide, got at least three write-in votes. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Jayne Miller is entering the final month as the Minneapolis park superintendent — a tumultuous time that often found her in the hot seat. </p>
<p>As she looks forward to her new job as president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, she reflected with pride on what she has accomplished and frustration at what she called unjust criticism. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. Why are you leaving?</strong></h3>
<p>A. I have been approached multiple times for career opportunities. The opportunity in Pittsburgh will allow me to take my experience and talents to an organization recognized as one of the top park conservancies in the country. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. Some of your colleagues said you didn’t see yourself being able to work with the incoming commissioners?</strong></h3>
<p>A. It is not about new faces. It is about the rhetoric of the election and the people who were elected. I think they have a lot to learn, and I’m also concerned about the direction they want to take the organization. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What are you most proud of?</strong></h3>
<p>A. Establishing good working relationships with the board, establishing good relationships with our partners in the community, strengthening our finances, improving staffing levels. Doing cutting-edge work around racial equity, environmental stewardship, planning and development, youth development and youth programs. The whole riverfront initiative is cutting-edge work, the Webber Natural Swimming Pool. </p>
<p>So many of us worked so tirelessly on closing the gap and are now committed to the 20-year <a href="http://www.startribune.com/mpls-approves-20-year-800-million-park-and-road-deal/377598941/">Neighborhood Park Plan</a>, a legacy initiative and plan for the Park Board. NPP20 is a neighborhood park plan, it’s a 20-year agreement with the city of Minneapolis, which again is historic.</p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What are advances made under your tenure?</strong></h3>
<p>A. The single greatest advances made during my tenure have been restoring our legacy and standing as a park system — being innovative in our work practices, leading the country in so many areas. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What is some unfinished business?</strong></h3>
<p>A. Continuing our equity work, continuing the work to stabilize the Park Board’s enterprise fund, implementing NPP20 and stabilizing our golf courses from a financial and operational perspective. The other thing is implementing the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/developer-sought-for-48-acre-city-owned-riverfront-wasteland/389615611/">Riverfirst</a> — that was going to be one of my major next initiatives, working much more closely with the foundation on raising the money we need to make Riverfirst happen.</p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What is your wish list for Minneapolis?</strong></h3>
<p>A. That it continues to diversify and acknowledges and recognizes the great work being done in this city. This is a city that doesn’t often recognize people who are doing really groundbreaking and hard work. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What are obstacles to making the workforce more diverse [in a city that’s 40 percent people of color]? </strong></h3>
<p>A. The first two of the six years I was here, we had a hiring freeze. If you look at four years, we went up over a percent every year. So, we increased by 5 percent. Our full-time workforce is 26.1 percent. I think one of the challenges [is] Minneapolis has a very large immigrant population. Immigrants by nature are more skeptical of government. We also have a lot of undocumented residents. So, are they going be confident of working in government, especially with what is happening at the federal level? </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What are some of the challenges you faced?</strong></h3>
<p>A. The first and most significant challenge I faced was not being from Minneapolis or Minnesota. There is a strong sense, in this city and state, that unless you are from here, you can’t work here because you don’t know enough about this place, you don’t have the skills and you don’t really belong here. This made my first 4-5 years here very difficult. I believe I have finally been accepted, but I worked really hard and I took a lot of crap. It was incredibly difficult. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What motivated you to keep going?</strong></h3>
<p>A. A lot of it is my upbringing. I came from a family with a really hard work ethic. But also a family that really valued recreation and being outdoors, and I care passionately about what we do for profession. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. How have you addressed park users’ concerns?</strong></h3>
<p>A. Listening, being out in the community, fostering new ways of thinking among Park Board staff, encouraging new ways of doing work so that we can be more responsive. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. Do you feel like activists have treated you fairly?</strong></h3>
<p>A. There are so many park activists in this city because people are passionate about our parks and because of the vital role parks play in everyone’s lives. Recent examples of activist work have been the work to help make NPP20 a reality and to ensure our forestry practices are the best. </p>
<p>During 2016 and 2017, there were many mistruths spoken loudly about the Park Board and me personally based on the actions of a disgruntled employee and former employees. We worked hard to address the truths and educate the public about the mistruths. For some reason that never got out there, [in] the Star Tribune coverage, that their allegations have not been upheld at all in any legal form. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. Is there anything you would have done differently? </strong></h3>
<p>A. I’m not someone who looks back and regrets decisions that I make. I don’t think there is anything I would do differently. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What challenges remain?</strong></h3>
<p>A. In addition to addressing the unfinished business I mentioned, I think the new superintendent will need to do heavy lifting to help bring together a new board coming in office after a very contentious and nasty election. The superintendent will need to help them understand the work of the organization, their role as elected officials, and bring them up to speed on very complex issues that will require their decisionmaking. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Q. What advice do you have for the next person?</strong></h3>
<p>A. A lot of patience, focused persistence, and heavy reliance on an incredibly strong and professional executive and leadership team in the organization. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Marcus Fuller</h4>
<p>Gophers senior guard Nate Mason is out for Saturday’s game against Harvard with an ankle injury. </p>
<p>Minnesota coach Richard  Pitino said Friday Mason could possibly play, but he decided to have him rest in the last game before the start of the Big Ten season. </p>
<div style="margin: 0 0 6px 12px;width:309px;float:right;"><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/marcusfuller_1514656916_pitinomason.jpg"></div>
<p>Freshman point guard Isaiah Washington will play start his second career game Saturday. Washington started in a Nov. 29 loss against Miami (Fla.). </p>
<p>Mason, who ranks second on the team in scoring (15.5) and first in assists (4.1), suffered a left ankle injury in the second half of last week’s win against Florida Atlantic. He was able to do an individual workout Thursday and Friday. </p>
<p>Pitino said the Gophers avoided huge loss when Mason wasn’t seriously hurt after the MRI came back negative last Saturday night. </p>
<p>The Gophers are hoping Mason will return to the lineup when Big Ten play starts again Wednesday against Illinois and Saturday against Indiana, both home games. </p>
<p>Junior Dupree McBrayer will play Saturday against Harvard after missing the last two games with a lower left leg injury. McBrayer, who averages 8.2 points per game, started 11 games this season. </p>
<p>— Harvard sophomore guard Bryce Aiken (knee) is out for the third straight game. Aiken leads the team with 17.6 points per game. </p>

<p>A cheery blue sky and unbroken sunlight played beauty to the beastly cold Saturday. </p>
<p>The dangerous subzero freeze caused icy road conditions and many early-morning crashes, including one with two serious injuries on westbound Interstate 494 on the Minnesota River Bridge. </p>
<p>Congestion on the bridge continued for hours, according to the <a href="https://hb.511mn.org/#area/minLat=44.682/minLon=-93.64/maxLat=45.252/maxLon=-92.75?timeFrame=CURRENT_ONLY&amp;layers=trafficSelectAll%2CgoogleTraffic%2CmetroTrafficMap">Minnesota Department of Transportation real-time road incidents map</a>. Other scattered road problems were reported across the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>The light snowfall and deep cold of the past week left roads with a dark sheen of ice. </p>
<p>Since last weekend, Minnesotans have seen a stretch of the kind of winter weather they live to complain about, then brag about their ability to endure. Over the Christmas weekend, temperatures were below zero, with deep double-digit windchills across most of the state. </p>
<p>For Minnesotans, that’s true cold, when thicker socks are required in the boots, gloves stay on in the car, the warmest parka comes off the hanger and even good cars get balky. </p>

<p>The past week’s dustings of snow and a temperature reprieve to single digits above zero gave way Saturday to another plunge into the deep freeze, and it will last a while. </p>
<p>This weekend, with New Year’s Eve and a Minnesota Vikings home game on Sunday, the Twin Cities reported a temperature of 11 below at midday Saturday. After Sunday, the forecast shows temperatures trending up, up and into the low 20s above zero. </p>
<p>Gov. Mark Dayton issued an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency, allowing propane delivery drivers to work longer hours in the next week to 10 days to meet demand. </p>
<p>The cold has diminished local supplies and drivers available for the work, meaning fewer drivers have to go farther to get the propane. More than 233,000 homes, farms and businesses rely on propane, including 3,300 hog and 3,746 poultry operations, the order said. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">Associated Press</h4>
<p>WASHINGTON — An Australian diplomat’s tip appears to have helped persuade the FBI to investigate Russian meddling in the U.S. election. So says The New York Times. </p>
<p>The Times says Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told the diplomat that Russia had thousands of emails incriminating Hillary Clinton. Australia passed that on to the FBI. The Times says the revelation that a Trump campaign member may have had inside information about the hacking of Democratic emails helped to spark the Russia probe. </p>
<p>Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is a cooperating witness. Court documents show he met in April 2016 with Joseph Mifsud, a professor in London who told him about Russia’s cache of Clinton emails. The Times says Papadopoulos shared this information with the diplomat. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>In cities across Minnesota, community leaders are boosting resources for homeless teens. </p>
<p>From St. Cloud, where a teen resource center will open in February, to Duluth, which plans to open a shelter for teens soon, outstate cities are addressing a problem that extends far beyond the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of homeless young people in Minnesota live outside the Twin Cities and its suburbs, according to Wilder Research. </p>
<p>“I call them the invisible population,” said Michelle Decker Gerrard of Wilder Research, who led a study on homeless youth that was released <a href="http://mnhomeless.org/minnesota-homeless-study/reports-and-fact-sheets/2015/2015-homeless-youth-4-17.pdf">earlier</a> this year.</p>
<p>Because it’s difficult to track the homeless, data varies. </p>
<p>The Wilder study found that 1,463 unaccompanied young people were homeless statewide in 2015, with most being 18 to 24 years old. But researchers say more teens likely weren’t counted and estimate Minnesota’s unaccompanied young homeless population tops 6,000 people 24 and younger. </p>
<p>This month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/homelessness-in-minnesota-jumped-4-5-percent-in-2017-hud-reports/462383543/">report</a> with new data that puts the estimate of unaccompanied homeless people in Minnesota this year at nearly 900 who are 25 and younger.</p>
<p>“It’s just a growing awareness [that] the needs of youth are different,” Gerrard said. </p>
<p>The state Department of Human Services says more than 70 programs across Minnesota work with young people, providing outreach and housing. </p>
<p>In St. Cloud, local Rotary clubs are teaming up to open a “youth opportunity center,” Pathways 4 Youth (P4Y), to help people ages 16 to 23. The 3,700-square-foot center will be in the Youth for Christ building at 203 Cooper Av. N. While it’s not a shelter — there are a few homeless shelters in the area — it will connect teens to social services, classes, showers, food and clothing. </p>
<p>Officials estimate up to 150 16- to 23-year-olds are homeless in St. Cloud each day. </p>
<p>“We just knew … there’s a gap in the St. Cloud community that didn’t provide that need,” said Tim Wensman of the local Rotary Club. “Our program is going to be geared to getting these youth back on a pathway to end youth homelessness.” </p>
<p>The center will open in February with help from HOPE 4 Youth in Anoka. Operating expenses and the cost for several staffers will be funded by the Rotary Club of St. Cloud, the Granite Rotary Club, the Great River Rotary Club and the St. Cloud Rotaract Club. A caseworker from Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud also is expected to work there. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Duluth, a ribbon-cutting took place this fall for a new emergency shelter that is expected to open sometime soon (no date has been set) for teens 15 to 19. </p>
<p>While there are two other shelters for teens, the Loft Shelter, sponsored by the nonprofit Life House, will be the first shelter in Duluth dedicated to teens in that specific age group. </p>
<p>“Homelessness in Minnesota, particularly in northern Minnesota, isn’t visible because it’s so dang cold,” said Maude Dornfeld, the organization’s executive director. Teens can spend months on waiting lists for housing. Now, up to 10 teens will have another option for a place to stay for as long as three months. The Loft will operate at Life House at 102 W. 1st St., which also offers housing, a drop-in youth center and a mental health and wellness program. </p>
<p>The shelter is part of expanding resources for homeless teens in Duluth, where an estimated 100 young people are homeless each night. </p>
<p>“We’re making a lot of progress in our community,” Dornfeld said. “Our goal is to reduce youth homelessness so it’s rare, brief and non-reoccurring.” </p>

        <title>State briefs: Rochester branding gets an update</title>
        <updated>2017-12-30T13:27:00-06:00</updated>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.startribune.com/state-briefs-rochester-branding-gets-an-update/467309983/"/>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h4>Rochester </h4>
<h4>Rah, rah, replacement: City gets new branding </h4>
<p>The city of Rochester plans to unveil a new slogan and logo this week when it rolls out a brand refresh that was more than a year in the making. The logo features a city skyline, while the slogan, “Minnesota’s Rochester: America’s City of Care and Innovation,” reflects the prominence of its No. 1 employer: the Mayo Clinic. </p>
<p>Rochester Convention and Visitors Bureau Executive Director Brad Jones said the first of the new branding debuts Tuesday, with more changes coming in the months ahead. </p>
<p>The RCVB will be renamed Experience Rochester, and the Rochester Amateur Sports Commission will become Rochester Sports. New websites for both offices should be up and running in a few months. </p>
<p>Jones said the emphasis on Minnesota was needed to help distinguish Rochester from its namesake in New York, according to market research conducted for the new slogan. </p>
<p>“We’re positioning ourselves to a global audience,” he said. </p>
<p>The marketing refresh cost about $150,000. Fuse Ideas of Boston did the branding work. The contract was paid for with funds raised from the local lodging tax of 7 percent, a portion of which goes to the RCVB. </p>
<p>The new slogan replaces “Rah, Rah Rochester,” which was unveiled in 2006 shortly after Jones arrived in the city. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Matt McKinney </p>
<h4>Pipestone </h4>
<h4>New treatment plant to reduce radioactivity </h4>
<p>A $15.4 million state grant will help the city of Pipestone complete a new water treatment plant expected to eliminate naturally occurring radioactivity in the water, said City Administrator Jeff Jones. </p>
<p>The plant has been under construction since the summer and should come on line by the end of 2018 or early 2019. </p>
<p>The plant will also soften the local groundwater before it’s piped to local homes, reducing the need for in-home water softeners. Local use of water softeners has led to high chloride levels in water discharged from local homes. </p>
<p>The Minnesota Public Facilities Authority provided the grant. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Matt McKinney </p>
<h4>St. Cloud </h4>
<h4>Hockey Day expected to draw up to 8K visitors </h4>
<p>St. Cloud is expecting to draw up to 8,000 visitors next month for the 12th annual statewide Hockey Day Minnesota. </p>
<p>The Jan. 19-20 festivities include outdoor hockey games on Lake George and at the National Sports Center in St. Cloud, including the first-ever outdoor women’s college hockey game (St. Cloud State will face off against rival University of Minnesota Duluth). The games will be broadcast on Fox Sports North or FSN Plus. </p>
<p>The St. Cloud Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau expects 6,000 to 8,000 visitors to attend. </p>
<p>Hockey Day Minnesota was started in 2007 by the Minnesota Wild. Stillwater, Duluth and St. Paul are just a few of the cities that have hosted the celebration. </p>

                                                                    <div style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">The St. Cloud Regional Airport is gearing up for Super Bowl traffic, expecting VIPs in private jets to need space to land, park and refuel their aircraft.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>At St. Cloud Regional Airport, staff members are counting out corporate jet parking spots and rehearsing scenarios to plow snow from runways amid more takeoffs and landings surrounding Super Bowl weekend. </p>
<p>At Rochester International Airport, officials are waiting to see which teams are in the championship game to get a sense of how many extra planes they might expect. </p>
<p>While the Twin Cities are abuzz with preparations for the big game, some airports outside the metro are also making plans for increased traffic from high-flyers on business jets. </p>
<p>In St. Cloud, Airport Director Bill Towle said he estimates crews could see from 40 to 50 extra business jets over the long weekend. “After the divisional playoff games is apparently when the phone starts ringing off the hook,” he said. </p>
<p>While smaller airports near the metro area can handle small jets, Towle said he expects some pilots who aren’t comfortable with winter weather to opt for St. Cloud or other larger outstate airports with precision instrument landing systems, making it easier to take off and land with relatively low cloud ceilings and visibility. </p>
<p>Officials expect some VIPs will try to be dropped off in the Twin Cities, with their pilots continuing on to airports outstate to park their jets; other VIPs might land outstate and take a car into town. Flight restrictions around U.S. Bank Stadium will hinder some movement in the metro during the game, Towle said. </p>
<p>St. Cloud could handle about 45 medium-sized business jets on its ramp parking area, and, if more space is needed, officials could close a runway to fit another 50 planes. </p>
<p>At Rochester International Airport, Executive Director John Reed said staff and flight-support crews are accustomed to handling VIP traffic. “We feel like we can support 20 to 30 planes very comfortably,” he said. </p>
<p>In Duluth, officials have parking space for about 32 jets, said Natalie Peterson, director of communications and marketing for the Duluth Airport Authority. </p>
<p>Towle said he’s excited about the increased attention his airport could get. “You just can’t put a dollar amount on this marketing,” he said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>It was a wild year in Minnesota politics. We lost a U.S. senator in Al Franken, who resigned under the duress of sexual harassment allegations, as did two state lawmakers. The Legislature sued Gov. Mark Dayton after he vetoed its budget. And as 2017 wraps up, a Republican who opposes abortion is on track to be Dayton’s lieutenant governor. </p>
<p>Next year promises to be equally unpredictable. </p>
<p>New Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach is vowing to stay in the Senate, making a lawsuit seeking to remove her likely. That could result in a 33-33 tie in the Senate between the GOP and DFL, if the latter can hold the seat vacated by former Sen. Dan Schoen. Control of the Senate could hinge on a special election to replace Fischbach. </p>
<p>Beyond that, Minnesota voters face two U.S. Senate races, a wide open governor’s race and at least four competitive U.S. House races. </p>
<p>We asked both newsmakers and readers for some 2018 predictions. </p>
<p>Showing off his sharp Minnesota humor, Dayton gave a brief response: “The Good Lord willing, I will be governor of Minnesota until January 7th, 2019.” </p>
<p>Dayton, whose collapse during his State of the State speech last February precipitated public admission of a cancer diagnosis, was making light of a nightmare scenario for many DFLers if he’s unable to serve: Republicans take full control of state government, call a special session, and Wisconsinize the state with glee. </p>
<p>(Dayton has since been given a cancer-free bill of health, he has said.) </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka predicted Republicans would expand their majority by winning the special election to replace Schoen. </p>
<p>Rep. Erin Murphy said Minnesota would elect its first nurse as governor. (She’s the only nurse running.) </p>
<p>Dale Trippler of North Oaks predicted that “Drilling in the Alaskan wilderness is in full bore, but no oil is found,” which would be an ironic end to a decadeslong fight between oil companies and environmentalists. </p>
<p>Todd Rapp, former DFL operative, predicts the year of the woman, especially on the DFL side: More than half of DFL challengers for the Legislature will be women, he said. After the primary, he thinks, the DFL will have three women at the top of the ticket (Senate, Senate, governor). </p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar avoided politics in her prediction: “The Vikings will be playing in the Super Bowl and 40 years later we will finally know the answer to my dad’s 1977 book, ‘Will the Vikings Ever Win the Super Bowl?’ ” </p>
<p>Stranger things have happened. </p>

<p>There’s usually plenty of drama inside Minnesota’s Capitol, but this January its interiors will become an actual theater stage as a local performing arts group mounts a production in the newly restored building. </p>
<p>“Our House: The Capitol Play Project” is based on interviews with more than 100 Capitol regulars. The play is an effort of St. Paul-based Wonderlust Productions, whose mission is “to forge new ways of seeing our common experiences by creating new plays that transform the past into a better future.” </p>
<p>The original production concerns the election of a “wild card new governor” who leaves the Capitol “thrown into chaos,” according to a press release from Wonderlust. “While a chorus of activists, legislators, lobbyists, civil servants and tour guides attempt to get their way, an idealistic new employee finds herself at the center of an unexpected controversy.” </p>
<p>The play also promises “misunderstandings and mistaken identities,” but it has a larger goal of illustrating “the realities that both constrain and inspire the men and women who have devoted themselves to public service,” a Wonderlust news release says. </p>
<p>Alan Berks and Leah Cooper co-wrote and will co-direct the play, which is drawn straight from the true-life workers’ stories. </p>
<p>The play will be shown six times in various locations around the Capitol building. The preview performance is on Jan. 19, followed by shows on Jan. 20, 21, 26, 27 and 28. Ticket information can be found at the Wonderlust Productions website, <a href="http://wonderlustproductions.org/">wonderlustproductions.org</a>.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Starting point guard Jeff Teague sustained a knee injury late in Wednesday’s Timberwolves victory over Denver. If it’s serious, backup Tyus Jones will be in the spotlight.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Rand</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/randball/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/28120127/teague.jpg">Jeff Teague arrived in Minnesota with a three-year, $57 million contract and a reputation for being a solid point guard who could score and distribute while potentially being a defensive liability. He’s been pretty much as advertised through the Wolves’ first 35 games, and while they owe their 22-13 record more to a handful of other players Teague has been a meaningful contributor.</p>
<p>He’s also been put in two unenviable positions of comparison. </p>
<p>One is to departed point guard Ricky Rubio, a fan favorite even as he polarized the Timberwolves’ rooting base by being quite good at everything except one very important thing: shooting the basketball. It was that deficiency that led coach/basketball boss Tom Thibodeau to move on from Rubio in an offseason unloading trade to the Jazz and to bring in Teague — a much better shooter but a much less flashy passer, among other things. </p>
<p>The second comparison is to backup point guard Tyus Jones — an improving third-year player and astute floor general who also happens to hold a trump card of being a Twin Cities native. </p>
<p>There are Wolves fans who can’t stop wondering what this team would have looked like if Rubio was still here with the improved supporting cast Thibodeau built in the offseason. And there are Wolves fans who have watched Jones and Teague this year and wondered if Jones should be playing more minutes than he has — or even more minutes than Teague. </p>
<p>They will get what they asked for on that second front, albeit under the worst circumstances of a Teague knee injury sustained late in Wednesday’s dramatic overtime win over Denver. Teague has a sprained knee <a href="http://www.startribune.com/timberwolves-jeff-teague-has-sprained-left-knee-no-structural-damage/467002483/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and will miss an unspecified amount of time</a>.</p>
<p>The question now becomes: Is Jones ready for an expanded role? </p>
<p>A quick look at the numbers would seem to suggest he is. </p>
<p>By several measures, Jones has outplayed Teague this season — albeit in playing about half the minutes. In terms of offensive and defensive rating — a measure of points produced or allowed per 100 possessions — Jones has been superior. He’s posted a 125 offensive rating and a 109 defensive rating ( <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per Basketball Reference</a>), while Teague’s offensive rating is 108 compared to a defensive rating of 112.</p>
<p>Jones has a higher true shooting percentage (.598 compared to .549 for Teague), in large part because Jones has actually been better than Teague from three-point range (41.9 percent to 37.5). Teague has a higher assist rate, but Jones turns the ball over less and produces more rebounds and steals. </p>
<p>Most importantly, when Teague was sidelined for a few games earlier this year, Jones showed he could handle an increased workload. In his three starts, Jones played at least 38 minutes each game and the Wolves went 2-1. Jones was a combined plus-45 in those three games (meaning the Wolves outscored opponents by 45 points when he was on the floor). </p>
<p>That said, there’s a big difference between playing well as a fill-in starter for a few games plus performing well off the bench in other games … and being the main guy almost every night like Teague has been. Jones has had the benefit of playing against other teams’ backups in some cases, and playing fewer minutes can hide a player’s weaknesses. Does Jones have the size, strength and quickness to match up with top point guards in the league? It’s a legitimate question. </p>
<p>Jones, though, does have the sort of skill set that would seem to mesh well with the other Wolves starters. The way he gets the Wolves organized is reminiscent, in fact, of Rubio’s skill set. </p>
<p>Jones has played 93 minutes this year in a lineup with the other four Wolves regular starters — Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson and Andrew Wiggins — and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018/lineups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Wolves have outscored opponents by an average of 10.9 points per 100 possessions during those minutes</a>.</p>
<p>It seems a safe bet to assume Jones will add to that total quite a bit Thursday night when the Wolves face Milwaukee in the second night of back-to-back games. </p>
<p>Beyond that, we’ll have to wait and see how he responds and how long Teague is out. </p>

<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, who’s been one of the surprise stories of the 2017 NFL season, will be a free agent in March and is in line for a significant raise next year because of how he’s played while leading the Vikings to a NFC North title. </p>
<p>The fact Keenum has been the Vikings’ starting quarterback for most of this season has him set to earn a little extra money this year, too. </p>
<p>According to sources with access to NFLPA salary data, Keenum would make an extra $250,000 if he plays 85 percent or more of the Vikings’ offensive plays this season. Keenum, who’s played 90.4 percent of the team’s offensive snaps this year, would hit the bonus if he starts on Sunday. He’d earn $150,000 if he plays 75 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps, but with the team still trying to secure a first-round bye against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Keenum figures to play. </p>
<p>He’d also add to a per-game roster bonus that pays him $46,875 each time he’s on the 46-man active roster on game day. Keenum has been active for every game this season, and would maximize his roster bonus at $750,000 if he’s active on Sunday. If he starts and plays most of the Vikings’ snaps, his bonuses and incentives for the season would total $1 million, in addition to $950,000 base salary, $250,000 signing bonus and $50,000 workout bonus. </p>
<p>That’d give Keenum a total of $2.25 million for the season. In any case, he’s going to end the year as a major bargain for the Vikings. But as the team turned to him, it also gave the quarterback a chance to earn a little extra cash. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at several other Vikings players who have a shot at incentives and roster bonuses in the regular-season finale. </p>
<p><strong>G Joe Berger: </strong>Can earn an extra $900,000 if he plays 90 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps (Berger has missed just two snaps all season). Berger can also cap out his per-game roster bonus at a total of $250,000 by being on the active roster for the 16th time this season on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>WR Michael Floyd: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $171,875 by being active for his 11th game.</p>
<p><strong>LB Emmanuel Lamur: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>LS Kevin McDermott: </strong>Will likely end the season with per-game roster bonuses of $23,437.50, given the fact he’s expected to miss Sunday’s game with a dislocated left shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>RB Latavius Murray: </strong>Can reach a $500,000 incentive, as well as a $500,000 salary escalator for 2018, by rushing for 169 yards on Sunday and finishing with 900 yards for the season. Can earn another $46,875 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season to tal to $750,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>CB Terence Newman: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Newman, who’s played 56 percent of the Vikings’ defensive snaps this season, is likely to fall short of a $150,000 incentive for playing 65 percent of the Vikings’ defensive plays.</p>
<p><strong>TE Kyle Rudolph: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Rudolph, who has 56 catches this season, won’t hit a $375,000 salary escalator for 2018 by reaching 80 catches this year, but already triggered one for next season by catching 83 passes last year.</p>
<p><strong>PR Marcus Sherels: </strong>Can earn a $100,000 incentive if he finishes the regular season as the NFL leader in punt return average. Sherels, who is currently sixth in the league with an average of 10 yards per punt, would need a prolific day to vault up the standings; the Lions’ Jamal Agnew currently leads the league with a 16.0 average.</p>
<p><strong>S Harrison Smith: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>WR Adam Thielen: </strong>Can earn a $1 million salary escalator for 2018 by catching five passes on Sunday, bringing his season total to 90 catches. Thielen has already secured a $750,000 salary escalator for next year by reaching 80 catches.</p>
<p><strong>WR Jarius Wright: </strong>Can make another $93,750 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $1.5 million by being on the 53-man roster for his 16th game. Wright restructured his deal with the Vikings before the season, taking a $1.05 million base salary instead of the $2.5 million he was scheduled to receive and converting $1.5 million to per-game bonuses. The restructuring came just before roster cuts at the end of the preseason.</p>
<p>Wright caught just 11 passes last season; with rookies Rodney Adams and Stacy Coley on the team’s initial 53-man roster, and Floyd set to join the team in October after a four-game suspension, the Vikings clearly wanted to retain some flexibility with the 28-year-old. The team wasn’t in a tight cap situation, and players don’t usually agree to convert base salaries to week-to-week bonuses unless they believe they’re at risk of not earning the money at all. </p>
<p>But Adams eventually wound up on the practice squad; Coley has played 27 snaps this season, and Floyd has caught only 10 passes for 78 yards. Wright has 18 catches for 178 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He could have to fight to stick around again in 2018, when his base salary is scheduled to jump back to $3.6 million, but he’s handled his role without griping and continued to prove his value. </p>
