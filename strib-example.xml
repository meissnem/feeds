<p> </p>
<p>The latest addition to downtown Excelsior’s charming Water St. community debuted last Friday. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/rsrexcelsior/">Red Sauce Rebellion</a>, a casual counter to Victor’s on Water, the more formal Italian restaurant it replaces, offers a completely remade space and a new, approachable menu at 205 Water St.</p>
<p>The team behind neighborhood restaurant <a href="http://coalitionrestaurant.com/">Coalition</a> made quick work of renovations after taking over the space on Nov. 1, but the major change is obvious. The elegant drop ceiling has been removed, and the space has been opened up significantly. Part of the kitchen is exposed, and a small bar near the back was jazzed up with turquoise tiling and plates decorated by a local artist.</p>
<p>There, cocktails such as the Rebellious Boulevardier – which incorporates port into the typical concoction of whiskey, Campari and vermouth – and other takes on classic drinks, are whipped up alongside pours from a substantial wine, vermouth, port and grappa list. </p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/ajrayno_1514478338_RedSauceRebellionCocktail.jpeg"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the menu is categorized into starters, soups and salads, pasta, rebel pies – that is, cast-iron, biscuit crust pizzas – and a handful of entrees. The nostalgia-aiming “Americanized” dishes include the likes of charred oysters, farro salad, linguine with clams and braised short ribs. Prices hover around the mid to high teens for most dishes. </p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/ajrayno_1514478376_RedSauceRebellionCharredOysters.jpeg"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, the basement area will be transformed into a cocktail bar, called Rebel Lounge. </p>
<p>Red Sauce Rebellion will serve lunch and dinner, opening at 11 a.m. daily and closing at 9 p.m. on Sun. and Mon., 10 p.m. on Tues., Wed. and Thurs. and 11 p.m. on Fri. and Sat. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Neal St. Anthony</h4>
<p><br> Wells Fargo, in partnership with Rebuilding Together, has recognized four Minneapolis small-business owners through its nationwide commercial-renovation competition: Wells Fargo Works for Small Business.<br> The “Neighborhood Renovation Program” small business contest netted three local finalists who received $10,000 toward facility renovation.<br> The winner is Hope and Healing Counseling Services. Hope received $25,000.</p>
<p>The local firms in the running were: <br> • Wendy’s House of Soul, a deli, and catering company that operates on W. Broadway Avenue in north Minneapolis. Owner Wendy Pucket, known for her “soul on a roll” specialty sandwich, will get a freshly painted exterior, new cooking equipment and counters.<br> • Marques Armstrong, a veteran mental health practitioner and his Hope and Healing Counseling Services of Minneapolis. Hope serves inner-city communities of color. Armstrong’s two-office practice will expand into three new therapy rooms, thanks to the Wells Fargo grant.<br> • Mridi Warfa and his Ibrahim Restaurant on E. Lake Street will get new chairs and kitchen equipment for a restaurant that serves healthy food and is a community gathering space.<br> • Ian Silver-Ramp, who studied agriculture at the University of Minnesota, operates Mississippi Mushrooms, on the river in north Minneapolis.<br>  </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Laurie Menser was a 7- or 8-year-old in Rockville, Md., when she wandered over to a neighbor’s house one day, slipped a glass eye in her mouth and got the attention of the grown-ups in the room. She smacked the back of her head, stuck out her tongue and waited for laughs. </p>
<p>She’s still waiting. </p>
<p>“They were appalled,” she said. “They were like, ‘You need to go home right now and tell your dad what you did.’ ” </p>
<p>The neighbors didn’t know that it was Menser’s father who’d picked up the fake eye at a yard sale and taught his daughter the gag. Don’t worry, he told her, “they just don’t get the joke.” </p>
<p>Looking back, Menser wonders how the episode might have gone had one element been different: What if she were a boy? “I think probably the neighbor would have told the little boy, ‘Hey, that’s gross and weird and don’t do that anymore,’ ” she said. “Whereas I got, ‘This is appalling.’ ” </p>
<p>Menser, 38, is a director of development at a science association. She has scaled the corporate ladder and is respected in her field. And she thinks that more than anything, her success has been driven by her sense of humor. </p>
<p>She just had to ignore all the voices telling her not to use it. </p>
<p>“There was an expectation that girls would be quieter. And wouldn’t ruin their dresses and wouldn’t be roughhousing and cracking jokes in church,” she said. “And I was very often doing a lot of those things,” thanks in part to her father’s encouragement to let her be what she was: funny. </p>
<p>Today we encourage our daughters to be ambitious and athletic, opinionated and outspoken. We want them focused on STEM and outfitted in T-shirts that read, “Who runs the world? Girls.” </p>
<p>But what if raising empowered girls also means raising funny ones? What if we teach our daughters humor is their turf — just as much as any boy’s? </p>
<p>“One of the things that happens to girls is that they are encroached upon by the world,” said Lisa Damour, a psychologist and author of “Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions Into Adulthood.” </p>
<p>“And one of the things that humor can do is … help girls stand up for themselves in ways that people don’t retaliate for.” </p>
<h3>Humor as a tool </h3>
<p>There’s an abundance of research on the social advantages that come with a strong sense of humor. Humor conveys intelligence. Funny people are seen as more confident and competent. The ability to crack a joke shows social ease and can turn awkward silence into a golden moment of human connection. </p>
<p>“It can actually shift perspective of status — and by status what we mean is respect, influence and admiration,” said T. Bradford Bitterly, co-author of a Wharton business school study on the use of humor in professional settings. </p>
<p>Humor isn’t alien to girls. Caroline Nugent remembers asking her father why people were always laughing at things she said. “It’s called wit,” he told her. </p>
<p>Nugent is 13, smart, self-aware and so enamored of Tina Fey that she spent two weeks at a Second City comedy camp. </p>
<p>Still, these days she isn’t that comfortable cracking jokes around boys or adults she doesn’t know well. </p>
<p>“I feel like when boys make jokes that are edgy, they get more praise for it, but since women are stereotypically dainty and quiet, especially in the past, they aren’t as encouraged to be funny,” she said. </p>
<p>Women’s potential for making jokes is equal to that of men, said Peter McGraw, director of the Humor Research Lab at the University of Colorado. </p>
<p>“When you actually measure a woman and a man’s ability to be funny in the laboratory, you create an even playing field — you remove the social pressures,” he said. “Women are just as good at this stuff as men are.” </p>
<p>But when Robert Provine, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, camped out at food courts and campus quads documenting instances of laughter, he found that men got the most laughs. </p>
<p>“Both men and women are more likely to laugh if a male is talking to them,” said Provine, author of “Laughter: A Scientific Investigation.” </p>
<p>McGraw concluded that there is something societal going on, not biological. </p>
<p>Natalie Sellman has heard stories that as a kid, her mother was a funny girl with a loud laugh. But she has never known her that way. In fact, Natalie’s mom told her that her own mother didn’t approve, often saying: “You laugh like a hyena. Women aren’t supposed to laugh like that.” </p>
<p>Sellman, a 36-year-old medical assistant from District Heights, Md., received some of the same messages. “Do I continue to be who I am?” she remembers wondering. “Or do I slow down just a little bit to fit in with the crowd?” </p>
<p>She piped down. A lot of girls do. But in her case it didn’t feel right. By the end of high school, she didn’t care what people thought anymore. </p>
<p>Today she laughs as loud as she wants and tries to get everyone — including her two daughters and the dozens of patients she sees every day — to do the same. Many of the patients tell her that it helps relieve the tension generated by a visit to the doctor. </p>
<h3>Everybody loses </h3>
<p>McGraw argues that by stunting women out of expressing their humor in mixed company, we’re shortchanging everybody. </p>
<p>“Funny people are better company,” he said. “They make the world an easier, more enjoyable place.” </p>
<p>Gina Barreca, a professor at the University of Connecticut who writes extensively about women and humor, thinks the reason girls often suppress their humor in adolescence is “it’s seen as alpha behavior.” </p>
<p>She added, “Someone holding the mic or getting the last word is not displaying traditional feminine behavior. A good girl doesn’t make anybody uncomfortable. Doesn’t take up too much space.” </p>
<p>But our ideas of “traditional feminine behavior” are always evolving. It wasn’t that long ago that athleticism wasn’t considered feminine. Now we almost require it. </p>
<p>So how does a parent cultivate humor in girls? </p>
<p>“Modeling it,” Damour said. “Being playful. Seeing it as a tool set like any other that can be fostered.” </p>
<p>Praise attempts at humor. Combat messages that diminish it. Encourage our sons to value humor in their girlfriends and girl friends. And their moms. </p>
<p>Recently, Menser’s 8-year-old niece said she liked that Menser is “funny and adventurous.” </p>
<p>“And I said, ‘So are you,’ ” Menser recalled. </p>
<p>“She recognized that that’s something valuable about me, and I want her to know that to me, that’s valuable about her. Because I see that there’s value there. I don’t know that everybody realizes how far being funny can get you, but it helps. It helps a lot in life.” </p>

Max went viral almost a month ago after he was banned from the Macalester College Library with a wanted-like poster.</div>
  
</div>
                                
                                
                                                            </div>
<p>Max sits on the windowsill of his St. Paul home, staring longingly out at the street he no longer has the freedom to roam. </p>
<p>Since rocketing to viral fame, the orange tabby known for <a href="http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-cat-won-t-stay-out-of-the-library-becomes-internet-sensation/461293973/">frequenting the Macalester College library — and then getting banned from it</a>, Max has become an indoor cat. Paw thing.</p>
<p>He gazes at the street, and late at night he howls — withdrawal symptoms for his addiction to fresh air and musty old books. </p>
<p>But on a recent winter morning, his human, Connie Lipton, took Max out of the house, strapped into a handsome red-and-black harness. She loaded him into her Mazda, with Max perched looking out the rear window, and took him to a nearby bookstore. </p>
<p>Max rose to national prominence last month after a cutesy sign appeared at the Macalester library that warned people not to let him in. Max had previously been spotted on security cameras, roaming the stacks. </p>
<p>More than 200,000 people “liked” <a href="https://twitter.com/e_mcguire_/status/935961091015958531/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startribune.com%2Fst-paul-cat-won-t-stay-out-of-the-library-becomes-internet-sensation%2F461293973%2F">a Twitter post about the library sign</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cool_cat_max_and_gracie/">Max’s own Instagram</a> (managed by Lipton) blew up to 16,500 followers.</p>

<p>It came out that Max was something of a campus celebrity. In addition to the library, he’d been visiting students in the science building, language buildings and dormitories on the other side of campus. He even had a private audience with the Macalester president, which was captured on film, of course. </p>
<p>But a construction project near his house, and an allergic library worker, made Max’s free-range travels no longer feasible. </p>
<p>While not everyone agreed that a cat should have been allowed into any building he desired, one local business made its allegiance known. In the days after Max went famous, Hal Johnson, who owns the Against the Current used-book store, drew “Welcome Max” on the chalkboard outside his Grand Avenue shop. </p>
<p>That’s where Lipton took Max, who was met by an entourage of Macalester groupies who had gotten to know him on his formerly untethered neighborhood outings. </p>
<p>The curious kitty wasted no time making himself at home. He climbed up into the window display, sniffed a book on “Americans From Norway” and nibbled on a lantern. Lipton whipped out a book of her own, “On Cats,” by Doris Lessing, which Max dutifully rubbed his face on. </p>
<p>Macalester student Ming Lian filmed the encounter, and the video will become part of a YouTube series on Max’s visits to Twin Cities bookstores and libraries. Lian, who lives in the French house, knows Max well. “He probably slept in everybody’s bed,” she said. </p>
<p>Lipton hopes the videos will “keep him in the eye of remembrance,” even as Max’s viral fame subsides. She wants to get Max trained as a therapy cat for college students, and eventually turn his following into a movement. </p>
<p>“If this energy keeps moving, I’d like to start a foundation for literacy,” she said. </p>
<p>She’s also had Max consult with an animal communicator, a type of psychic, who is helping him deal with his new indoor status — as well as his newfound fame. </p>
<p>Lipton learned that Max “basically was very excited about doing all these things.” </p>
<p>While Max was indiscriminate with his campus visits, he’s become associated with books thanks to library worker Chris Schommer, who wrote the now renowned sign banning Max (with illustrator Gamze Genc Celik). Schommer signed with an agent following Max’s stardom and is writing a children’s book based on Max’s story. </p>
<p>“Max likes people, and the library is at the crossroads of campus,” said Schommer, who had joined Max on his trip to Against the Current. “He likes that hub of activity.” </p>
<p>But is there something special about books that draws Max in? Johnson, the book shop owner, deferred to Max on that one. “I can’t speak for the cat,” he said. </p>

<p>Hundreds of high school students from Minnetonka and Edina are tutoring elementary school pupils — not in the suburbs, but in Minneapolis. </p>
<p>This year more than 500 Minnetonka and Edina High School students have enrolled in the program run by Backpack Tutoring, a nonprofit that aims to help schools close the achievement gap and fight poverty. </p>
<p>“The greatest need is in Minneapolis,” said Bob Davis, the program’s chief executive volunteer. “Minneapolis is leading the achievement gap.” </p>
<p>Backpack Tutoring was started by a Minnetonka student in 1997 for an Eagle Scout project. Davis and his wife, Diana, are now the driving force and have worked to return the program to its student-led roots. </p>
<p>The program runs for 20 weeks from October through March. Minnetonka and Edina School districts cover transportation costs. Tutors clock in 15,000 hours per year, Diana said. The tutors are not paid for their work with the program. But the benefits are ample, she said. The work inspires many to write about their experience in their college application essays while others go on to become teachers. </p>
<p>“This gives them a leadership and volunteer opportunity and exposes them to new and different cultures and communities, with the opportunity to learn and grow in their awareness to issues beyond their own neighborhoods,” Diana said. </p>
<p>The tutors work with kids whose reading or math levels are typically one or sometimes two grades behind their peers. They go to Folwell four days a week after school and two days during regular school hours at Jefferson. Teachers at the schools supervise tutors and provide teaching materials specific to each child. </p>
<p>In addition to tutoring, the students recruit fellow high schoolers for the program, coordinate logistical needs and even manage the programs. </p>
<p>Julia Luehr, a Minnetonka High School senior from Chanhassen, has spent her high school years tutoring and mentoring several Folwell students. Now she manages volunteers and is responsible for cataloging attendance, but she still makes sure she tutors. The hands-on experience for more than an hour a day, one day a week, for 20 weeks has defined her career path. Luehr said she plans on becoming an engineer or a mathematician and help kids with disabilities. </p>
<p>“This program has taught me a viable lesson about work ethic,” Luehr said. “I love going because I believe every kid deserves a good education. You can see how kids are improving and also you make a personal connection with these young kids.” </p>
<p>Folwell teacher Deborah Martel, who supervises the after-school program, said the relationship the kids have built with the tutors has had a positive impact on their learning. </p>
<p>“They are excited,” Martel said. “They want to come, do the work with the tutors and they like it that they are young and energetic.” </p>
<p>In addition to tutoring, the nonprofit has an annual donation drive to collect winter clothing for children who come to school without the proper gear. For more information on the program, e-mail bdavis@backpacktutoring.org. </p>

<p>A paper sign reading “Victoria” in block letters is posted where a marquee used to shine. Inside the century-old St. Paul building, some of the brick walls are covered by remnants of landscape paintings, and a leaky roof has dappled the plywood floor with water stains. The front window facing University Avenue is patched with duct tape. </p>
<p>Frogtown neighbors have spent a decade discussing the future of the vacant Victoria Theater. They held dozens of community meetings and knocked on doors to come up with their plan: a theater and community gathering place, with an office for the Frogtown radio station and perhaps a small coffee shop. </p>
<p>They need another $2 million, and a lot of work, to turn the decrepit building into a functioning theater — but community members said they are closer than ever to achieving their vision. </p>
<p>St. Paul leaders voted this month to give the project a $200,000 grant and a $412,000 forgivable loan, and the local Hardenbergh Foundation awarded a $150,000 grant, said Julie Adams-Gerth, who was hired a couple of months ago as the first executive director of the Victoria Theater Arts Center, a newly formed nonprofit. </p>
<p>“It was a vote of confidence,” Adams-Gerth said of the city money. “The community sees it moving forward now in a really concrete way.” </p>
<p>The Vic, as neighbors call it, sits on University Avenue facing the Green Line’s Victoria Street station. It was a silent movie theater in its first life. Then came a Prohibition-era stint as a speakeasy and nightclub and after that a decades-long run as a lighting store. About two decades ago, it fell vacant and into disrepair. </p>

<p>“It’s going to be work, but we’re up for it,” Adams-Gerth said as she wandered through the cold, largely empty building that she estimates will open in two years. </p>
<p>It almost suffered a very different fate. </p>
<p>In 2009, the Vic was going to be demolished and replaced with a parking lot. Neighbors fought to protect the building and in 2011 the city designated it a heritage preservation site, saving it from destruction. </p>
<p>“It’s a rare surviving example of silent movie theaters from around that time,” said Aaron Rubenstein, with the nonprofit Historic St. Paul. </p>
<p>In addition to its storied speakeasy past — it was raided for illegally selling alcohol — it is known for a 1927 recording by the house band, the Victoria Cafe Orchestra, that ended up in the Anthology of American Folk Music. That recording was key to securing heritage preservation status, Rubenstein said. </p>
<p>The Land Bank Twin Cities bought the building in 2014 with the intent to sell it to the Victoria Theater Arts Center, Adams-Gerth said. Purchasing the building is one of the next steps before renovation. She does not yet know what the full purchase cost will be. </p>
<p>“It’s probably the most celebrated, waited-for project in the last 10 years in Frogtown,” said Caty Royce, director of the Frogtown Neighborhood Association. The association led the many community meetings where residents developed the plan for a theater and gathering place. </p>
<p>The neighborhood lacks meeting space, Adams-Gerth said. And Royce noted Frogtown doesn’t have a theater the size of the Vic, which is expected to have seating for about 120 people and standing room for more than 300. </p>
<p>“Families in the neighborhood, particularly young folks, are hungering for a place like this,” said MK Nguyen, a Frogtown resident who is on the Victoria Theater Arts Center steering committee. “There’s nothing like art, and art spaces, that can unleash genius and power.” </p>

<p>Taylor Lindeman delivered his family’s most precious Christmas present Monday along a frigid roadside in Chisago City shortly after his pregnant wife, Hannah, said he’d better call an ambulance. </p>
<p>The couple spent Christmas Eve at Taylor Lindeman’s parents’ home in Shafer, Minn., near Taylors Falls. Taylor Lindeman, 29, said his wife had been up and down much of the night with contractions but she wasn’t especially concerned. </p>
<p>Christmas Day started about 7 a.m. when their daughters, Lilly, 5, and Dahlia, 3, began opening their presents. The adults started opening their gifts, but Lindeman said his wife couldn’t get through hers because her contractions grew more frequent and “much more painful.” </p>
<p>They left his parents’ house about 9 a.m. for the 45-minute drive to United Hospital in St. Paul. </p>
<p>“I called United to tell them that we were coming. After that, my wife said that I needed to call an ambulance,” Taylor said. “Her contractions were very, very painful. So I called the ambulance and stayed on the line and then eventually had to stop to have the ambulance find us, because they said if I keep driving they couldn’t continue following me.” </p>
<p>They pulled off Hwy. 8 in a windswept area at the edge of Chisago City and Wyoming. Taylor put the ambulance dispatcher on speaker phone and went around to the passenger side of the vehicle where Hannah, 31, was seated. He stood at the open door. He said it was minus-1 or minus-2 degrees outside with a windchill making it feel like 25-below. </p>

<p>No passers-by stopped to help, Taylor said. He guessed that it was too cold, and that other drivers had their Christmas destinations in mind. </p>
<p>“While I was on the phone with the dispatcher, her water broke,” Taylor said. </p>
<p>That was 9:18 a.m. </p>
<p>Just two minutes later, out came their daughter Poppy. At 20.5 inches long and 6 pounds, 8 ounces — “She’s our biggest baby yet,” the proud poppa said. </p>
<p>A Lakes Area Police officer arrived a minute or two later and stayed with the Lindemans while they waited a few minutes for the ambulance. Taylor closed the passenger door and cranked up the heat. </p>
<p>The police officer cut a shoelace from Hannah’s boot and tied off the umbilical cord, as instructed by an Allina Health dispatcher. </p>
<p>“The police officer did a really good job. The paramedics did a really good job, too,” Taylor said. </p>
<p>He said both parents were doing well at United Hospital Monday afternoon as they braced for a crush of reporters and photographers. They expect to return to their home in Byron, Minn. sometime Wednesday. </p>
<p>Taylor, who teaches seventh-grade English in the Rochester Public Schools, said the delivery took him and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, by surprise. Hannah’s first delivery took between seven to nine hours, he said. Her second delivery came about three hours after they arrived at the hospital. This one, he said, probably took 60 to 90 minutes. </p>
<p>“We weren’t really expecting today to be the delivery — but obviously she had other plans,” Taylor said of Poppy. </p>

<p>Staff at homeless shelters in the Twin Cities likely will be working round-the-clock shifts by this weekend, when temperatures in the Twin Cities will bottom out in the double digits below zero. </p>
<p>The worst will come Saturday, when the high temperature is forecast to be 6 below. Before that, though, there’s a brief respite. Remember, warm is relative. Wednesday’s high is expected to be 6 degrees above zero; Thursday’s forecast called for 15 and Friday for 3. New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, well, 0 and 1 degree. </p>
<p>So, how do people who have to be outside, either by necessity or circumstance, deal with the cold? </p>
<p>Mail carriers will indeed deliver mail at temperatures of 15 below, said Darla Swanson, communications manager for the U.S. Postal Service. The carriers’ employer reminds them regularly to dress properly, stay dry, keep extra clothing in the vehicle in case they become wet and know the signs and symptoms of cold stress. </p>
<p>The same “safety first” credo applies for workers who are out battling ice buildup on the roads or cutting brush in the extreme cold, said Kevin Gutknecht, communications director for the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). </p>
<p>Crews were working in various locations for MnDOT on Tuesday, Gutknecht said. </p>

<p>Outdoor work in the winter takes longer. That’s just the way it is, and MnDOT is OK with that, he said. Most outdoor work crews are experienced and know when it’s time to take a break to warm up. </p>
<p>“We want to make sure whatever we do, we want to do it safely,” Gutknecht said. </p>
<p>It’s not so easy for people who find themselves homeless in below-zero temperatures. </p>
<p>“Our practice is to try to stay open all day when the temperature is not going to creep above zero,” said Wendy Wiegmann, director of programs at Simpson Housing, which coordinates beds at several shelters in the metro area. </p>
<p>Most shelters close at 9 a.m. and reopen at 5 p.m., but that isn’t realistic when people need a place to be out of the dangerous cold and wind. </p>
<p>“It is definitely taxing to find the staffing, food, resources to keep operating when we normally close,” Wiegmann said. “We managed to stay up all day [Monday] and [Tuesday] for those that are staying at our shelter already.” </p>
<p>People outside by choice also need to heed the cold. </p>
<p>The St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office reported that it received a call at 10:09 p.m. Monday about an overdue hunter in Beatty Township near Cook, Minn. The man had left home about 1:30 p.m., and his family became concerned when he didn’t return. </p>
<p>He was found about 4:20 p.m. Tuesday. His truck had become stuck and he began walking to find help. The man was taken to Cook Hospital suffering from hypothermia, the Sheriff’s Office said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Minneapolis issued a warning Tuesday to keep pets and humans safe during extreme cold spells. </p>
<p>“Everyone should remember: If it’s too cold for them, it’s probably too cold for their pets,” the city said. Anyone who sees an animal outside without shelter should call Minneapolis Animal Care and Control at 612-673-3000. </p>
<p>The city of Minnetonka advised residents about keeping water pipes from freezing. It urged making sure the furnace’s cold-air return is pointed away from water pipes; leaving kitchen and bathroom cabinets open for air circulation, and having someone keep an eye on the house if you’re away. </p>

<p>A man was fighting for his life Tuesday after being hit by an eastbound light rail train in St. Paul the night before, officials said. </p>
<p>The incident occurred about 7:50 p.m. Monday along the rail line at Prior Avenue, said Metro Transit spokesman Howie Padilla. </p>
<p>Padilla said David John Hardy, 49, of Minneapolis, was in critical condition at Regions Hospital as of Tuesday morning. </p>
<p>Authorities have yet to explain the circumstances that led to him being struck. </p>
<p style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;">“Preliminary information from initial viewing of video evidence shows that he appeared to be staggering before laying on [the] tracks,” Padilla . </p>

<p>A house fire in the middle of the night on the Iron Range killed a husband, wife and two of their grandchildren, and left a third grandchild less seriously harmed, authorities said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The blaze in the 200 block of 42nd Street E. in a Hibbing neighborhood broke out shortly after 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Fire Department said. </p>
<p>Fire crews arrived to find one juvenile outside and four other people trapped inside, fire officials said. </p>
<p>The four were pulled from the fire on the south end of town about 15 minutes later and were not breathing. While the two children were resuscitated and hospitalized, the couple died, the Fire Department said. </p>
<p>Authorities later said one of the children died Tuesday and then another not long after at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. </p>
<p>The husband and wife were officially identified Wednesday as Steven Gillitzer, 67, and 63-year-old Patricia Gillitzer. </p>

<p>It was soon after the fire was extinguished that “we learned that this tragedy would strike us close to home,” a department statement read, referring to Steven Gillitzer’s nearly quarter-century as a Hibbing firefighter paramedic until his retirement in 2000. </p>
<p>Some in the department now worked with Gillitzer during his tenure, “adding a level of difficulty to an already devastating situation,” the statement continued. Flags outside the Hibbing fire stations were at half-staff Tuesday afternoon in his memory. </p>
<p>The grandchildren who died were identified as Todd Gillitzer Jr., 9, and Isaiah Adams, 3. Surviving the blaze was Jonathan Gillitzer, 8. </p>
<p>Fire officials have not released a preliminary cause of the blaze, which left the house a total loss. </p>
<p>“The investigation is ongoing amongst the double-digit below-zero temperatures,” a Fire Department statement read. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>WASHINGTON — They were the 13 days that transformed the White House. </p>
<p>Even for an administration that spent most of 2017 throwing off headlines at a dizzying pace, events in the second half of July unfolded at breakneck speed. They encapsulated both the promise and peril of President Donald Trump&#8217;s first year in office — and yielded aftershocks that reverberate within the White House even as the calendar turns to 2018. </p>
<p>The two-week span laid bare the splintering of Trump&#8217;s relationships with two influential Cabinet members, foreshadowed the reach of the Russia probe into the interior of his orbit; saw the dramatic, last-minute defeat of one of the president&#8217;s signature campaign promises and featured a senior staff shake-up that reset the rhythms of this presidency. </p>
<p>Inside the West Wing, the chaotic days between July 19-31 stand as a panicked memory but also one that paved the way for future successes, according to nearly two dozen administration officials, outside advisers and lawmakers. Most of those interviewed for this account spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private events. </p>
<p>For the record, though: &#8220;That was the extreme,&#8221; said former press secretary Sean Spicer. </p>
<p>A leading driver of the chaos was Anthony Scaramucci, who was hired to be the White House&#8217;s communications director on July 21, aiming to usher in a new era at a White House riven by in-fighting, drowning in bad press and struggling to maintain credibility. </p>

<p>But his shockingly brief tenure — some White House aides have taken to calling a short period of time a &#8220;Mooch&#8221; — underscored the drama that frequently paralyzed the West Wing. Spicer quit in protest. Scaramucci fired one staffer and threatened to push out others as he vowed to cut down on leaks. But many in the White House believed that was a cover for his own agenda. Believing that chief strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had initially blocked his entrance to the White House, Scaramucci moved to oust the pair, culminating in an infamous and vulgar New Yorker interview attacking them. </p>
<p>Scaramucci himself was pushed out the door by another change agent: new Chief of Staff John Kelly. </p>
<p>In a July 28 tweet sent with no warning from Air Force One, Trump announced that he was appointing Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary and a retired four-star general, to the post. As the 140-character bursts reached their phones, a pair of senior aides who been sitting in an idling SUV with Priebus stepped out and left the outgoing chief of staff alone. A new phase of the presidency began. </p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s hire, several advisers said, cut down on internal fights, restored order to the West Wing and laid the groundwork for wins down the road. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can overestimate the effect of the impact of those (staff) changes and that period,&#8221; said Marc Lotter, Vice President Mike Pence&#8217;s former spokesman. </p>
<p>But there were limits to his influence, as Kelly made clear he would mount no effort to manage Trump&#8217;s no-holds Twitter habit. And Trump, in turn, chafed at Kelly&#8217;s handling. </p>
<p>A legislative blow just hours earlier on July 28 had highlighted the administration&#8217;s troubled agenda at a time of unified Republican control in Washington. When Arizona Sen. John McCain&#8217;s thumbs-down ended the Republican attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. </p>
<p>From that bungling rose more discipline and the administration&#8217;s first major legislative triumph: the tax cut legislation passed on Dec. 20. The White House would fully support the plan at the start. Trump&#8217;s political operation would begin work to sell the tax package in the approaching midterm elections. Trump himself worked behind the scenes, making phone calls to key members and, perhaps more importantly, reined in his public criticism of members of his own party. </p>
<p>But while he stuck to GOP orthodoxy on those domestic matters, Trump has steadfastly declined to adopt conventional approaches on foreign policy, straining decades-long alliances, refusing to condemn authoritarian regimes on human rights abuses and escalating the rhetoric in a nuclear stand-off with North Korea. </p>
<p>That came to a head during a July 20 meeting in the windowless Pentagon room known as &#8220;The Tank,&#8221; which shined a spotlight on the sharp learning curve that the president faced as he grew into his new job. It also revealed the tensions within the administration between those seasoned in international affairs — including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who reportedly called the president &#8220;a moron&#8221; afterward — and those eager to pull back from international entanglements. </p>
<p>Six days later, FBI agents, armed with a search warrant, emerged from Trump&#8217;s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort&#8217;s home in Alexandria, Va. with a trove of material. A new, more dangerous, chapter had begun in special counsel Robert Mueller&#8217;s investigation into possible coordination between the president&#8217;s campaign and Russian officials. </p>
<p>Scores of top aides and allies, including Jared Kushner and Trump&#8217;s eldest son, Donald Jr., have been questioned by Mueller and congressional investigators. In October, Manafort was charged with money laundering and other financial crimes related to his political consulting work in Ukraine. And on Dec. 1, former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is cooperating with the investigation. </p>
<p>Trump had grown furious at the distraction, fuming to advisers that he had done nothing wrong while railing that it was a conspiracy by Democrats and the so-called &#8220;deep state&#8221; to delegitimize his presidency. Yet he emerged from the crucible of the 13 days in July with a more organized and less drama-filled White House, as well as lessons learned that would yield legislative victories. </p>
<p>But the president himself remains unchanged. </p>
<p>Impulsive and unconventional, Trump has spent his first year in office casting aside norms and mores. With his Twitter account as his weapon, he has shown no willingness to ignore any slight or change the brash ways that he believes got him elected. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so easy to act presidential,&#8221; Trump told supporters in Ohio on July 25. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not gonna to get it done.&#8221; </p>

Set amid the backdrop of a president grappling with his deepest insecurities, the West Wing�s breakdown in policy collided with its collapse in personnel and acted as a crucial inflection point for Trump�s first year in office. Buffeted by fierce rains and wind, Air Force One circled in the skies above Washington on July 28. When it finally touched down at Joint Base Andrews, a presidency had been forever altered. In a series of tweets, Trump announced a decision that had been reached the night before, that he was appointing John Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general, to be his new chief of staff, replacing Priebus.

<p>Laurie Mahoney was in a Twin Cities hospital, where both her parents were nearing death, when she got the call from her nephew Brett Blader. </p>
<p>Mahoney’s son, Ryan Briese, 34, was dead from a drug overdose in the Minnetonka home that Blader and Briese shared. </p>
<p>“I was in complete shock,” Mahoney said, recounting that July 19 night when Blader told her the news. “I had to leave my parents” at Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park. </p>
<p>Two hours later, her father, Dan Mahoney died, she said. </p>
<p>“How do you process that two of the most important men in your life are dead?” Mahoney said on the day her son’s alleged drug provider was charged with murder. </p>
<p>Mahoney was in Hennepin County District Court on Tuesday when Sarah E. Doppler, 28, who had been her son’s co-worker at Comcast offices in Minnetonka, appeared and had her bail set at $200,000. </p>

<p>Doppler, of Golden Valley, was charged Friday with third-degree murder in connection with Briese’s overdose at the home in the 14000 block of Brandbury Walk. Her attorney was not immediately available to comment on the allegations. </p>
<p>The medical examiner’s office said Briese died after ingesting a mix of drugs, including synthetic opioids, fentanyl and an opioid analgesic. </p>
<p>Officers called to the home found Briese not breathing in front of his computer. He was declared dead at the scene. Police found drug paraphernalia and several tablets nearby with “E8” inscribed on them, according to the criminal complaint. </p>
<p>A friend told police that Briese had said that day that he was going to meet with Doppler, someone known to deal in illicit narcotics. Briese’s cellphone placed him near Doppler’s home on the day he died and contained text messages showing his intent to buy pills from her, according to the charging document. </p>
<p>Doppler is alleged to have sold Briese fentanyl, a drug considered far more addicting and deadly than heroin. </p>
<p>Briese attended Bloomington Jefferson High School, where his experience of being cut as a senior from varsity hockey tryouts in 2000 was recounted in the popular nonfiction book “Blades of Glory” by John Rosengren. </p>
<p>Briese went on to play with the Bloomington Amateur Hockey Association’s youth Junior Gold team, worked at a car dealership two years after graduation and kept skating recreationally, according to the book. </p>
<p>Matt Duncan, a close friend who played varsity for Jefferson and skated with Briese in their youth, said that he, Briese and a few other guys in their Jefferson days “were a tight group of kids.” When Briese was cut, he said, “that hit us pretty hard.” </p>
<p>Since her son’s death, Mahoney has started the Ryan’s Rink Rats Foundation and raised $7,000 for the hockey association that Briese called his hockey home for many years. Anyone seeking more information can e-mail ryansrinkrats@gmail.com or visit facebook.com/ryans­rinkrats. </p>

                                    </div>
<h3>Rio Nido’s comeback returns </h3>
<p>West Bank perennials of swing-era vocal jazz, the trio Rio Nido spruced up the ’30s and ’40s for 1970s and ’80s Minneapolis, refashioning the era of Al Jolson, Cab Calloway and the Boswell Sisters with a pinch of counterculture panache and social consciousness. Those values haven’t changed. And the trio’s musical virtues have aged well, thanks in part to vocalists/guitarists Prudence Johnson, Tim Sparks and Tom Lieberman — all pros with successful careers outside the band who know how to put on a show. (7 and 9 p.m. Wed., Dakota, Mpls., $25-$35, <a href="http://www.dakotacooks.com/">dakotacooks.com</a>)</p>
<h3>Making it up as they go </h3>
<p>A pair of saxophonists parrying riffs or passing bleats back and forth in a totally improvised setting? That often makes for compelling jazz. Le Voyage is one of the better quartets to emerge this year, with the horns in question being veteran Donald Washington and young’un Matt Trice. The rhythm section is similarly multigenerational with Washington’s longtime bassist Dick Studer alongside drummer Steve Hirsh. (9 p.m. Thu., Khyber Pass, St. Paul; $5, <a href="http://khyberpasscafe.com/music/">khyberpasscafe.com</a>)</p>
<h3>The kids are all right </h3>
<p>Hoaxer is one of the Twin Cities’ better young bands, playing Saturday at Black Dog. Another strong, adventurous young ensemble to watch is the sextet No Exit, featuring bassist Charlie Lincoln and saxophonist Peter Goggin from Hoaxer, as well as the comparably older whiz kid Levi Schwartzberg on vibes and rugged young talents on guitar, drums and trombone. (8 p.m. Fri., Jazz Central, Mpls.; $10, theillicitjazz workshop.info) </p>
<h3>Two guitars, one flow </h3>
<p>Two guitarists in one jazz ensemble can be dicey, but the way Dean Granros and Zacc Harris braid and diverge with their Tall Tales quartet is a treat. It doesn’t hurt that the rhythm section (drummer Jay Epstein, bassist Chris Bates) manages to be incisive and unassuming at the same time. (9 p.m. Fri., Dunsmore Room at Crooners, Fridley; $12, <a href="https://croonersloungemn.ticketfly.com/calendar">crooners loungemn.com</a>)</p>

<p>As a landmark election unfolds an ocean away, Minnesota&#8217;s vast Liberian community has sprung into action, throwing support behind candidates and working to sway family members&#8217; votes. Calls home buzz with chatter about Tuesday&#8217;s presidential runoff, which pits Joseph Boakai, the current vice president, against George Weah, a retired soccer icon. </p>
<p>Hopes are high that this race will mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one elected president to another in decades, a critical test of the country&#8217;s democracy after a lengthy period of civil war came to an end in 2003. </p>
<p>For months, Minnesotans have been making their voices heard on social media and beyond, and wooing relatives to vote for their preferred candidates. Some have even flown back to Liberia to door-knock and watch the election action firsthand. </p>
<p>&#8220;Minnesota is just not an observer or a sideline cheering squad,&#8221; said Abdullah Kiatamba, a Liberian community leader and executive director of the nonprofit African Immigrant Services. &#8220;Minnesota is shaping and influencing things.&#8221; </p>
<p>Eager to get involved, members of the area&#8217;s large Liberian community are writing and sharing opinion pieces, planning watch parties and linking up with local offshoots of Liberian political parties with active presences in Minnesota. </p>
<p>&#8220;People are literally living in two worlds around this election,&#8221; said Kiatamba, who is personally backing Weah. &#8220;People are involved here as much as people on the ground.&#8221; </p>

<p>Community leaders say more than 30,000 people of Liberian descent live in Minnesota, with many concentrated in the northwest metro. They often describe Minnesota as home to the most Liberians outside Liberia. </p>
<p>The community&#8217;s size makes Minnesota &#8220;strategic ground&#8221; during elections, said Duannah Siryon, who&#8217;s involved with the Coalition for Democratic Change campaign, the political party of candidate Weah. </p>
<p>Major candidates commonly pay visits to the North Star State, eager to test their messages and build crucial support from a population that has strong financial pull with relatives still living in Liberia. Both presidential hopefuls have made Minnesota appearances, Liberian community leaders say. </p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot successfully win elections in Liberia without huge support from the diaspora community,&#8221; said Wynfred Russell of African Career, Education and Resource Inc., a metro-area nonprofit. </p>
<p>The diaspora, Russell said, wields significant economic power and influence, often sending regular financial support to family members back in Liberia. </p>
<p>&#8220;People will say openly, &#8216;Look, if you don&#8217;t support my candidate, you can rest assured I&#8217;m not going to send you money for Christmas.&#8217; Folks will oblige,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;Proverbially, you cannot bite the hand that feeds you.&#8221; </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">&#8216;A new beginning&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p>Since October, Al-Hussein Fadiga has taken to the airwaves in Brooklyn Park to spread the word about the race and promote his preferred candidate, Vice President Boakai. </p>
<p>His online radio station, Radio Africa, attracts thousands of Liberian listeners across the globe. He runs the program with his brother, Hassan Fadiga. Al-Hussein Fadiga said the ability to share information online has been revolutionary in this year&#8217;s race. </p>
<p>&#8220;Social media has been a game-changer,&#8221; Fadiga said. &#8220;A lot of Liberians see this election as a new beginning.&#8221; </p>
<p>Some north metro residents, like Erasmus Tiampa Williams, have taken political action beyond computer screens, traveling to Liberia to campaign in person. A few months ago, Williams went from village to village and town to town to advocate for his chosen candidate, Boakai. </p>
<p>He said common concerns emerged on the campaign trail. </p>
<p>&#8220;People want change but also stability,&#8221; said Williams, who&#8217;s also the national vice chairman of the Unity Party in America and Canada, Boakai&#8217;s political party. &#8220;No one wants the country to return to war.&#8221; </p>
<p>Observers say the election so far has been peaceful, with Liberians around the world waiting to see if peace holds once the race is decided. </p>
<p>The first round of the presidential election took place in October without a candidate winning a majority, prompting Tuesday&#8217;s runoff between the top two finishers. The winner will take over for Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa&#8217;s first democratically elected female head of state and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. </p>
<p>Attention now turns to the election results, which are expected to be certified in the coming days. Many say the closely watched outcome means as much in Minnesota as anywhere in the world. </p>

<p>A tenants’ attorney has asked Hennepin County District Court to hold a new landlord in contempt for failing to turn over keys, financial records and other information to an independent administrator appointed last week to take control of five south Minneapolis apartment buildings. </p>
<p>The landlord, Rickey Misco, <a href="http://m.startribune.com/court-referee-puts-five-minneapolis-apartment-buildings-sold-by-landlord-frenz-under-administrator/465304993/">was found </a>by district court housing referee JaPaul Harris to lack a valid apartment rental license and to be collecting rents illegally on 69 units. He was ordered to refund to tenants rents for September, October and November, and turn December rents over to the administrator.</p>
<p>Attorney Michael Cockson of Faegre Baker Daniels, working pro bono for the tenants, said Tuesday that Misco has offered “no cooperation” and has not turned over the money, which could total around $200,000. Cockson filed the contempt motion Friday and said he expected a hearing to be held this week or next. </p>
<p>Neither Misco, or his attorney, M. Juldeh Jalloh, could be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Misco, a former repairman for Stephen Frenz, one of the city’s biggest landlords, bought the buildings from him last summer on contracts for deed while Frenz was in the final stages of being banned by the Minneapolis City Council from holding a rental license. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://m.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-unanimously-revokes-landlord-s-rental-licenses/462873813/">council banned</a> Frenz earlier this month after it concluded he jointly owned some 60 rental properties with Spiros Zorbalas. Zorbalas was accused of operating substandard apartment buildings; Frenz has been similarly accused.</p>
<p>Under a contract for deed, if Misco defaults, ownership reverts to Frenz and Zorbalas, according to the city’s regulatory services division, and thus the two maintain control of the property. </p>
<p>The regulatory division refused to grant Misco a rental license, even as he was collecting rents and posting notices that he would evict tenants if they did not pay. </p>
<p>On Dec. 19, referee Harris found Misco should not collect rents, appointed James Bartholomew of Lighthouse Management Group as administrator and ordered Misco to cooperate. </p>
<p>“Mr. Bartholomew isn’t able to get notices out to tenants and collect the rent on Jan. 1,” said Cockson. “My fear is that Mr. Misco may collect January rent as well.” </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://m.startribune.com/in-unprecedented-move-minneapolis-seeks-an-administrator-for-23-apartment-buildings-housing-1-200-tenants/466008403/">separate motion</a> last Friday, the Minneapolis city attorney’s office asked the housing court to put an administrator in charge of 23 other buildings Frenz has sold on contracts for deed. A hearing is set for Jan. 3.</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By IVAN MORENO
                                                                                                                                            Associated Press</h4>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Harley-Davidson is placing a renewed emphasis on teaching people to ride as part of its efforts to attract more customers. </p>
<p>The Milwaukee-based company&#8217;s decision to expand the number of dealerships with a Harley &#8220;Riding Academy&#8221; comes as the industry grapples with years of declining sales and an aging customer base. </p>
<p>The program launched in 2000 with about 50 locations and now 245 dealerships in the U.S. offer the three- or four-day course. The company says about a quarter of those launched since 2014. </p>
<p>Harley sold 124,777 new motorcycles through nine months in 2017, down from 135,581 during the same period the previous year, according to the company&#8217;s most recent earnings report. </p>
<p>The Motorcycle Industry Council says the median age of motorcycle owners increased from 32 to 47 since 1990. About 46 percent of riders are over 50; only about 10 percent are 30-34. </p>
<p>Samantha Kay rode on the back of her father&#8217;s motorcycle growing up, but when the 25-year-old took a class to ride for the first time she couldn&#8217;t help being anxious. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think motorcycles inherently do scare a lot of people,&#8221; said Kay, a Milwaukee woman who is one of 50,000 people nationwide who took a riding course at a Harley-Davidson dealership this year. </p>
<p>The training is one of the ways Harley is trying to attract a new generation of riders like Kay amid big demographic shifts. </p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the aging Baby Boomers, which have been the guts of Harley-Davidson&#8217;s purchasers, they&#8217;re getting older and some of them are just getting out of the sport because they can&#8217;t handle the motorcycle anymore,&#8221; said Clyde Fessler, who retired from Harley-Davidson in 2002 after holding several executive positions over 25 years. He created what became the &#8220;Riding Academy.&#8221; </p>
<p>He said the idea &#8220;is getting people comfortable on a motorcycle and getting them to feel safe and confident.&#8221; </p>
<p>In addition to riders getting older, a slow economic recovery has made it harder for millennials to buy new motorcycles, said Jim Williams, vice president of the American Motorcyclist Association. </p>
<p>Among the newest models, a 2018 Softail Slim starts at $15,899 and a 2018 Sportster Forty-Eight at $11,299. </p>
<p>&#8220;The younger generations are buying plenty of motorcycles, they&#8217;re just not new,&#8221; Williams said. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all the millennials&#8217; fault, said Robert Pandya, who managed public relations for Indian Motorcycles and Victory Motorcycles. Pandya recently launched &#8220;Give A Shift,&#8221; a volunteer group discussing ideas to promote motorcycling. One of their conclusions, he said, is the idea that &#8220;if mom rides, the kids will ride.&#8221; </p>
<p>Currently, women are about 14 percent of the riding population, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. </p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest possible opportunity in motorcycling is to invite more women to ride,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not lost on Harley-Davidson. Among the ways Harley-Davidson is trying to reach younger riders is by having motorcycle role-models like Jessica Haggett, the founder of the &#8220;The Litas&#8221; all-women motorcycle club, be a voice for the company on social media. And the company is also focusing advertising efforts in male-dominated sports like the X Games and UFC events popular with younger viewers. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have to work harder to gain share of mind with young adults, for example, in that they have other activities in their lives. They&#8217;re on screens, they&#8217;re connecting socially, they&#8217;re involved in gaming, they&#8217;re involved in other things,&#8221; said Heather Malenshek, Harley-Davidson&#8217;s vice president of marketing. </p>
<p>She said the easily customizable Sports Glide model that launched in November and the aggressive, performance-driven Fat Bob also have younger riders in mind. In all, the company plans to release 100 new motorcycles over the next 10 years. During that time, the company also wants to gain 2 million new riders. </p>
<p>Terri Meehan took plenty of motorcycle rides with friends as a passenger but has wanted to be in the driver&#8217;s seat for a while. The 42-year-old took the Harley-Davidson riding course in October because she wanted to learn from &#8220;an expert who could teach right way versus someone who had learned bad habits.&#8221; </p>
<p>The price of the class varies by dealership but it&#8217;s generally about $300. Students spend time in class learning about motorcycle safety and on ranges learning to ride. Meehan plans to buy a motorcycle soon. </p>
<p>&#8220;My son&#8217;s a psychology major so he asked me if I was going through a mid-life crisis, which is actually quite hilarious,&#8221; said Meehan. </p>
<p>Kay&#8217;s experience notwithstanding, another challenge for Harley-Davidson is motorcycling simply isn&#8217;t a major part of people&#8217;s upbringing like it was once, Malenshek said. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about Baby Boomers, they probably were brought up on a dirt bike or had an uncle or a neighbor or something who was riding around in a Harley-Davidson. That may not be the case today,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>She said the company&#8217;s CEO, Matthew Levatich, is encouraging employees to engage people in conversations about motorcycling if someone happens to say, &#8220;Nice bike.&#8221; Melanshek took that to heart during an interaction with someone at a gas station who complimented her on her motorcycle and told her he&#8217;d never thought about riding. </p>
<p>&#8220;And I said, &#8216;I can get you hooked up with the riding academy!&#8217;&#8221; </p>

<p>Canada Arten boarded a flight back to Africa this month — after eight years awaiting his deportation and months of last-ditch efforts to avert it. But in a stunning reversal for the Twin Cities man and 91 other deportees on board, the plane turned back to the United States. </p>
<p>The flight’s return has landed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a legal, logistical and public relations morass. The case of Arten, who arrived as a refugee but lost his legal status after a robbery conviction, highlights the cascade of complications triggered by the failed mission. A federal lawsuit in Florida on behalf of him and other passengers, who allege physical abuse aboard the flight, has blocked their deportations until at least Jan. 8. </p>
<p>In federal court in Minneapolis, Arten’s attorney successfully argued the botched flight puts into question the government’s ability to send people back to Somalia; Arten could be released in a month. </p>
<p>The legal challenges could have long-term significance, tackling a question fought out in courtrooms across the country: How much of a role can the courts play in deportation challenges? The government disputes the passengers’ allegations and the idea that it can’t pull off deportations to Somalia. </p>
<p> </p>

<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t think this one failed mission, despite all the publicity, detracts from all the successful missions that have gone before, which of course do not get the same publicity,” said Ann Bildtsen, an assistant U.S. attorney, in a Minneapolis courtroom. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Mission gone wrong</strong></h3>
<p>Arten came to the United States in his early teens after losing family members in Somalia’s civil war. He was ordered deported in 2009, three years after his felony robbery conviction. But at the time, ICE could not send him to Somalia, which did not have a functioning government. Arten, who had prior convictions for assault and disorderly conduct, went on to rack up offenses for car theft, terroristic threats and drunken driving, among others. </p>
<p>A federal judge this week said that “the severity and frequency of Arten’s criminal activity has subsided in recent years,” and his mother, Lul Hussein, said he cared for her as she battled kidney disease. </p>
<p>In March, ICE detained him and set out to deport him. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rising-deportations-to-somalia-raise-concerns-in-minnesota/426385301/">Deportations to Somalia</a> resumed and picked up under President Barack Obama; under Donald Trump, their numbers have swelled, to 520 this past fiscal year.</p>
<p>In the following months, an immigration judge denied a request to reopen Arten’s case, and the Board of Immigration Appeals denied his appeal. A second attempt to reopen his case based on worsening security in Somalia also failed; an appeal is pending, but a request to stay his deportation was denied. </p>
<p>On Dec. 7, Arten got on a chartered flight to Senegal, the first leg of his return to Somalia. ICE says two-thirds of the passengers had criminal convictions, including for murder. Others had unsuccessfully sought asylum, including a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular technician and an Owatonna police officer who has a U.S. citizen wife and children. </p>
<p>In court documents, ICE says shortly before the plane landed in Senegal’s capital, Dakar, the relief crew notified the agency that a hotel power outage prevented them from getting required rest. The original crew went to a hotel to rest, and the plane sat on the runway for more than 20 hours, after Senegal refused to allow deportees to get off. Because of the delay, ICE said, the plane would have had to wait another 20 hours before continuing to Djibouti to meet a connecting flight to Somalia. Because of crew fatigue and the detainees’ “restlessness,” the agency made the call to fly back to Florida, where the passengers are now detained. </p>
<p>This week, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., wrote to ICE demanding answers about the Somalia mission. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">A legal opportunity?</strong></h3>
<p>Earlier this week, the University of Minnesota’s Center for New Americans, the University of Miami School of Law and two other organizations filed <a href="http://strib.mn/2D9mcAv">a federal lawsuit in Miami</a>, alleging ICE officers and contract guards kicked, struck, dragged, choked and bound detainees during the Dakar layover. The suit also says the passengers sat shackled for more than 40 hours and did not get enough food or bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>Attorneys argue the international headlines about the failed mission make returning the deportees even riskier. They say the publicity has alerted the terror group Al-Shabab, linked to the October bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 500. </p>
<p>The government denied the deportees were mistreated and argued the Miami court does not have jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, lawyers have seized on the failed mission in a flurry of legal challenges. For example, local attorney Mirella Ceja-Orozco asked the local immigration court to revisit the case of client Rahim Mohamed, a truck driver facing deportation over a years-old conviction. </p>
<p>In Minneapolis federal court, Arten’s attorney asked for a temporary restraining order, arguing to send him back before his appeal is resolved would violate his due process rights. There’s more: Arten has been detained longer than six months, which means the government needs to show it can deport him soon or let him go. Rachel Petersen, his attorney, said she doesn’t buy the government’s explanation for the flight’s return, suggesting it has to do with Somalia’s past intransigence on deportations and unstable conditions. </p>
<p>“A plane went all the way to Africa, sat for a day and instead of continuing across Africa, returned to the U.S.,” she told Magistrate Judge David Schultz. She said Arten, who broke his wrist in a fall and still wears a cast, was extremely uncomfortable and was slapped by a guard. </p>
<p>Bildtsen, the government attorney, noted that Arten has gone to immigration court and the board of appeals twice, taking “a second bite at the apple.” “At what point do we reach a point of finality so the law can be executed?” she said. </p>
<p>To complicate matters for the government, a travel document the Somali Embassy issued for Arten expires this month. Bildtsen argued the Minneapolis court doesn’t have jurisdiction — and doesn’t need to issue a separate order given the stay in Miami as securing new documents and planning another mission will take time, she said. </p>
<p>But Schultz noted that means Arten might have to be released in the wake of the failed flight, which he dubbed “a bit of a mystery.” He found that Arten should stay until his appeal is decided and gave the government 30 days to release him or show it can deport him soon — findings the government can challenge. </p>
<p>Jurisdiction is a key question, said Rebecca Sharpless at the University of Miami. In 2005, Congress gave sole authority for deportation challenges to the immigration appeals board. But in recent years, federal courts have carved out exceptions. In fact, the court in Minneapolis kept two men from boarding the Dec. 7 flight to Somalia. </p>
<p>Michele McKenzie at Minneapolis-based nonprofit Advocates for Human Rights, which helped with the Miami suit, says attorneys and advocates will highlight the December mission’s failure to question the wisdom of attempting more and call for more transparency about the flights. </p>
<p>Said McKenzie, “We know we can’t pretend this didn’t happen.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>﻿A growing chain of weight-loss stores from Sioux Falls, S.D.-based Sanford Health has landed in the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>A local franchisee opened the first <a href="http://profileplan.net/">Profile by Sanford</a> store in the metro late last month, and has plans for another five outlets at retail centers across the Twin Cities by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Currently, Sanford and its franchisees operate 35 stores in 11 states, and have plans for more than 70 new stores over the next two years. </p>
<p>The moves come as researchers say the percentage of overweight and obese adults is growing, while the share of those trying to lose weight has been declining. </p>
<p>Sanford officials believe they are offering an effective approach to weight loss, and are betting the health system’s brand can expand to new products — much like Sanford and Minneapolis-based Allina Health System are trying their hand these days at selling health insurance. </p>
<p>“Just as Allina [and Sanford] think that operating their own insurance companies leverages the positive feelings that people have about their health providers, I would say that Sanford is finding that they can extend those positive feelings to other ventures, like nutrition and lifestyle coaching,” Allan Baumgarten, a health care analyst in St. Louis Park, said via e-mail. </p>
<p>Sanford Health is already a big name as a hospital and clinic operator in western Minnesota, with the Minnesota Department of Health tracking 429 available beds at 15 hospitals. It’s one of the larger health care systems in the Upper Midwest, with a total of 44 hospitals and nearly 300 clinics in nine states. </p>
<p>For the fiscal year ending June 30, Sanford posted operating income of $151 million on $4.4 billion in revenue. In November, the system announced its first international hospital investment by acquiring a minority stake in a medical center in Germany. </p>
<p>In October 2012, Sanford launched the weight-loss business, which aspires to compete with big national names like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig. </p>
<p>People who access the service at a Profile by Sanford storefront pay a $300 annual fee that provides personal coaching and development of a weight-loss plan. At the outset, customers replace all grocery store food with food sold by Profile, said Tom Grady, the franchisee working with other investors to bring the stores to the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>The 25 stores open for the entirety of the 12-month period ending in June had collective gross sales of about $30 million and were serving about 28,000 members, according to documents filed with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. They describe the stores as “weight management centers.” </p>
<p>Sanford Health clinicians researched the science behind the weight-loss program, although published studies showing its impact aren’t yet available, said Nate Malloy, a vice president for the business. Most Profile by Sanford stores right now are owned by the health system, but franchisees will play a bigger role going forward. </p>
<p>“People that are truly having and experiencing life-changing results [are] driving 100 percent of our growth,” Malloy said. Program participants receive a scale that provides wireless, real-time progress monitoring through web and mobile apps. </p>
<p>Technology is a big part of the evolving weight-management market, according to research from Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, who covers Weight Watchers. </p>
<p>“We believe mobile apps and other technologies have commoditized aspects of the weight-management category,” Hottovy wrote last month. “Although we don’t view Weight Watchers’ clinically proven platform as a commodity product in an industry rife with false claims, we believe the previous lack of program and technology innovations made it difficult for consumers to distinguish Weight Watchers’ in-person and online businesses from new rivals.” </p>
<p>Through the first nine months of 2017, Weight Watchers posted net income of $100.5 million on revenue of $994.4 million. A company spokeswoman pointed to a recent report from Marketdata LLC, a market-research firm that projects the commercial weight-loss programs market is growing about 9 percent this year to $3 billion. </p>
<p>Commercial programs are just one of 10 major segments that Marketdata says are collectively worth about $66 billion. But Marketdata recently noted headwinds: “The number of active dieters is estimated to have fallen 10 percent since 2015, to 97 million, due to a growing size acceptance movement and dieter fatigue.” </p>
<p>In March, researchers in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted similar trends. In a study that included 27,350 participants, researchers observed that overweight and obesity prevalence increased from 52.7 percent in 1988-94 to 65.6 percent in 2009-14. The share of those trying to lose weight declined from 55.7 percent in the earlier period to 49.2 percent in 2009-14. </p>
<p>“Socially acceptable body weight is increasing,” researchers wrote. “If more individuals who are overweight or obese are satisfied with their weight, fewer might be motivated to lose unhealthy weight.” </p>
<p>Sanford said the Profile program already has helped nearly 800 people in the Twin Cities through a phone-based coaching model. </p>
<p>Grady, the local franchisee, said his company hopes to convince those clients to become customers at the new brick-and-mortar operations. Sanford Health will continue to own and operate Profile stores in Mankato and St. Cloud. </p>
<p>“We will continue to expand nationally, in North America, with additional locations owned by … Sanford Health, but at the same time leverage the franchise model to have a broader reach and a broader impact,” Malloy said. “We believe that our franchise partners are able to help us expand into markets that perhaps we wouldn’t be able to get to from a corporate standpoint as fast.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>In a message to political supporters, Attorney General Lori Swanson said Tuesday that she would file a lawsuit with other state attorneys general asking the court to overturn a federal decision that repeals a rule designed to keep access to the internet free and open. </p>
<p>The move would challenge the Federal Communications Commission’s <a href="http://www.startribune.com/as-net-neutrality-vote-nears-some-brace-for-a-long-fight/464061773/">recent overturning</a> of “net neutrality,” a 2015 regulation mandating that internet companies treat all traffic equally and not create slow or fast lanes for companies based on extra fees.</p>
<p>“Without net neutrality, broadband companies are free to block content they don’t want you to see, to slow it down and make it harder to access, or to prioritize content based on who pays them money,” Swanson wrote to supporters in an e-mail. “Mega corporations can dominate the content people see online by paying money to obtain faster speeds. This will make it more difficult and more expensive for consumers to access the content they want.” </p>
<p>Over the summer, the FCC’s proposal drew a record 20 million-plus public comments. The commission voted 3-2 this month to undo the Obama-era rule, with Chairman Ajit Pai saying the move would benefit consumers and give broadband providers more incentive to build networks. </p>
<p>The FCC’s ruling was always expected to draw legal challenges, and attorneys general of New York, Oregon, Washington, Illinois and Iowa have already expressed an intent to sue. Litigants have to wait 10 days until after the decision is posted in the federal register, which has yet to happen. </p>
<p>Swanson, a DFLer, is considered a likely contender for next year’s gubernatorial race. </p>
<p>She concluded her e-mail with praise for Sen. Al Franken, a fellow DFLer who is leaving office next week and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/franken-open-internet-advocates-push-back-as-fcc-moves-to-dismantle-net-neutrality/441196013/">has made</a> the preservation of net neutrality one of his biggest causes.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>Some local bars are preparing to keep the Super Bowl party going through the night when football fans descend on the Twin Cities in February. </p>
<p>St. Paul leaders voted last week to allow bars to sell alcohol until 4 a.m., beyond the usual 2 a.m. closing time, if they get a permit. Minneapolis and Bloomington passed similar measures this fall. </p>
<p>The special permits are possible because of a change in state law <a href="http://www.startribune.com/bill-would-let-bars-stay-open-till-4-a-m-during-2018-super-bowl-week/410884045/">approved by the Legislature</a> this year that extends the state’s allowed liquor sales hours during the Super Bowl weekend — from Feb. 2 to 5.</p>
<p>About 16 businesses have already signed up in Bloomington, said Doug Junker, the city’s license examiner and deputy city clerk. Most are in or near the Mall of America. </p>
<p>“We’ll see what this brings, being that we have so many hotels here,” he said. “Everybody’s going downtown [in Minneapolis], but they’re coming home here.” </p>
<p>About 15 St. Paul businesses expressed interest when the city queried them earlier this year, said Robert Humphrey, public information officer with the city’s Department of Safety and Inspections. That’s out of about 225 businesses that would be eligible. </p>

                  The Legislature approved a change in state law that lets bars sell liquor after the normal 2 a.m. closing time.

<p>So far only one has asked for an application: Kelly’s Depot Bar in Lowertown. </p>
<p>“It’s just an extra little boost and business for a couple of days,” said Patty Kelly, a manager at Kelly’s. </p>
<p>In Minneapolis, six businesses have applied for the special licenses. Two are nightclubs: Monarch Minneapolis and Privé. The others are Maxwell’s American Pub, Last Call Bar &amp; Grill, Randle’s Restaurant and Bar and Hop21. </p>
<p>Maxwell’s general manager, Mike “Rosie” Rosenstiel, said they only plan on staying open that late if someone rents out the bar for a private event. </p>
<p>Smaller parties like that are still being planned. “We should know … once the local teams are decided, whether it’s the Vikings or somebody else,” Rosenstiel said. </p>
<p>It isn’t the first time in recent years bars have remained open later. About 30 Minneapolis businesses extended their hours during the All-Star Game in 2014. State law also allowed for later hours during the Republican National Convention (RNC) in 2008. </p>
<p>“We didn’t get a ton of them for RNC,” Junker said. “But the RNC and the Super Bowl are different animals.” </p>

<p>Not a single person was wearing a hairnet. </p>
<p>That was one of the first things Liz Mattern noticed when she walked into what was a factory she once worked in. </p>
<p>The other thing? </p>
<p>“It smells different,“ said Mattern. “Used to be we could smell crackers baking when we walked up.” </p>
<p>That was when the southeast Minneapolis building was home to RyKrisp. </p>
<p>For more than three decades, Mattern, of Shoreview, worked here, where the once-popular crackers were mixed, baked and packed. </p>

<p>Now, the same space where workers like Mattern once punched a clock is a hive of mostly millennial entrepreneurs hustling to build their brands. The rejiggered building, known as North Co., is an example of how work — and expectations for a middle-class livelihood — have changed in the past half-century. </p>
<p>“What you see in that building captures a broad transformation in the workforce,” said Prof. William Jones, a labor historian at the University of Minnesota. “It reflects the way the economy is structured, with the shift from manufacturing to the more high-paid information work.” </p>
<p>If Mattern, who wore a company-issued uniform, steel-toed boots and the omnipresent hairnet, is emblematic of the building’s first life, then Angela Sauro represents its second. Standing at a computer design station clad in running shoes, yoga pants and a hoodie, the 23-year-old designer works in e-commerce, customizing wooden products ordered over the internet. </p>
<p>“My title is ‘laser dragon,’ ” Sauro said. “We all have fun names for our jobs. A dragon throws fire and since I work with lasers, so do I.” </p>
<p>Sauro works for Woodchuck USA, a five-year-old Minneapolis startup and the largest tenant in the North Co. building on SE. 9th Street, taking up half of its 80,000 square feet. The company manufactures dozens of wooden products, including cellphone cases, journals, flasks and boxes. </p>
<p>Sauro, a 2016 graduate of the University of Minnesota, came to Woodchuck because she wanted “a job where I could use my creativity,” she said. “I have independence; they trust me and I’m my own manager. I smile every day when I walk in the door.” </p>
<p>Even though the building no longer turns out crackers, its products are still American-made, said Ben VandenWymelenberg, 27, founder and CEO of Woodchuck USA and one of the co-developers of the building. </p>
<p>“That’s what we’re proud to be about with everything we’re making here.” </p>
<h3>Keeping the ‘cool’ </h3>
<p>While it’s been heavily renovated, the building still pays homage to its origins. </p>
<p>The Woodchuck machines hum in the stretch of the building once known as the bake shop, where three 110-foot-long ovens cranked out the crackers that were shipped to stores around the world. The renovation preserved the original scarred wooden floors, vintage metal doors and explosion-proof factory lighting, while incorporating contemporary must-haves — including standing desks, pingpong tables and bins of free snacks. </p>
<p>Even some of the RyKrisp machinery remains. A hulking steel compressor the size of a golf cart sits like a piece of sculpture in the kitchen common area. Nearby, a cast-iron wheel as big as a round dinner table is laid flat and topped with tempered glass, turned into lobby furniture. </p>
<p>“We kept the cool elements, said VandenWymelenberg. “The building helps attract the kind of businesses we want.” </p>
<p>Across the country, it seems that rehabbed industrial space is a draw for millennial employees. </p>
<p>In Troy, N.Y., a branding firm is housed in a former collar factory. An ad agency converted a tobacco factory in Winston-Salem, N.C., into its workspace. And an abandoned cookie factory in Pittsburgh is now Bakery Square, with more than 200,000 square feet of green office space. Google is its largest tenant. </p>
<p>“Everyone wants to work in a place like this. It’s the headline on our job postings, ‘Come work in our renovated factory space,’ ” said Gerard Garramone, vice president of operations for Woodchuck USA. “Offices with drop ceilings and cubicles are awful. The energy is different here.” </p>

<h3>Enter the entrepreneurs </h3>
<p>In its first year, North Co. is at capacity with 22 businesses, mostly started by people in their 20s and 30s. They include apparel companies, a social media agency, a video production company, a custom drum manufacturer and a medical device startup. A salon is in the first-floor space that once housed the RyKrisp company vault. </p>
<p>That’s a good sign, according to Amy Lynch, president of Generational Edge, a research firm that consults with companies on generational differences. </p>
<p>“Millennials have a strong entrepreneurial bent,” she said. “They grew up in an era when the traditional relationship between employee and employer broke down and long-term employment didn’t pay off for a lot of people, including their parents. </p>
<p>“The success stories they admire and follow are people who created their own direction.” </p>
<p>Of course, that freedom comes with a risk. </p>
<p>“Entrepreneurs make a risk exchange,” said Jones, the U professor. “There isn’t security but there is opportunity and for some of them, that will pay off.” </p>
<p>The working world was different when Mattern arrived at RyKrisp in 1974. She joined the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International, which bargained for safe working conditions, seniority and benefits. But she had no expectations that her satisfaction would be part of the package. </p>

<p>“When you pack crackers all day, it’s a grind. Our bosses did not consider it their job to make us happy. It was their job to make sure the work got done and our job to take care of it,” she said. “We were well paid, but we certainly earned those wages.” </p>
<p>The RyKrisp factory opened in 1922, and it retained a loyal following with Nordic Americans for its crackers, a crunchy companion to herring and cheese. </p>
<p>“When I started in 1974, we had probably 90 people working there and we were going 24 hours a day,” said Mattern, who retired in 2008. </p>
<p>But over the decades, it was bought and sold several times as tastes changed and sales dwindled. The crackers went out of production in 2015. </p>
<p>Mattern said she’s pleased that the building where she spent so much of her working life has itself found new life. And she’s tickled that the new owners left the RyKrisp logo in place. </p>
<p>“A nod to our history,” she said. “That’s a nice touch.” </p>

<p>In case you missed <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-approves-10-000-raise-for-new-mayor-and-council/466010693/">the news</a> while preparing for the holidays in your own year-end rush, the council — led by secret Santa and outgoing President Barb Johnson — voted unanimously on Dec. 15 to increase annual salaries for its members and the mayor by $10,000. (Abdi Warsame was absent.)</p>
<p>The numbers are less troublesome than the process, or lack thereof. The raises were not on the pre-meeting agenda, no council committees had considered them, and there was no public comment period or public hearing. They also weren’t included in the city’s recently approved $1.4 billion <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-approves-10-000-raise-for-new-mayor-and-council/466010693/ ">2018 budget</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson, ending an otherwise solid career as a voice of reason on the council, introduced <a href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/File/756/2018-2021%20Council%20and%20Mayor%20Salaries%20Resolution.pdf">the resolution</a>, explaining during the meeting that the increases will put Minneapolis council members in similar salary territory with their full-time counterparts in Denver and Boston but still $20,000 below those in Portland and Seattle.</p>
<p>Minneapolis council members, who will be paid $98,695 next year, did receive 2.5 percent annual increases for the past four years after being paid $80,354 with no increases in 2012 and 2013. </p>
<p>Despite Johnson’s efforts, it’s difficult to make good comparisons. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman earns $126,000 a year (vs. the $126,528 post-raise salary for Minneapolis Mayor-elect Jacob Frey), and the capital city’s council members are paid $63,000 for what is supposed to be part-time work. </p>
<p>Hennepin County commissioners are paid $113,566 annually, with the exception of Republican gubernatorial candidate Jeff Johnson, who has kept his own salary at $108,093. </p>
<p>Not to be overlooked in the stealthy Minneapolis resolution is the provision that the mayor and council members also will receive raises in each year of their four-year terms. Those hikes will be tied to increases the council approves in the city’s collective bargaining agreements with unionized workers. Taxpayers should take note as those agreements take shape. </p>
<p>In a statement provided after the Dec. 15 meeting, city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie pointed out that the 2018 increases represent just 0.01 percent of the total 2018 budget. The money will be scraped from the approved budgets of several city departments that had received increases for new 2018 initiatives. </p>
<p>“The city anticipates no negative impact to current services provided to those who live, work and play in Minneapolis as a result of this council action,” McKenzie wrote. </p>
<p>The Star Tribune Editorial Board has long argued that pay for public officials needs to be relatively comparable to private-sector salaries for jobs with similar responsibilities. The elected representatives who control the state’s largest and most important city should receive competitive compensation. </p>
<p>But Minneapolis taxpayers also deserve a more accountable, more open process than what transpired at City Hall on Dec. 15. There will be five newcomers on the 2018 council, and Frey will move into the mayor’s office. As just part of the payback for the hefty salary increases they’ll benefit from, the newcomers and veteran council members should commit to more transparency in decisionmaking. </p>

<p>It is the season for holiday celebrations, for holiday shopping, office parties, family get-togethers. Everyone is expected to enjoy their time off work and their travel to holiday destinations. We all get a break in the routine of day-to-day life. </p>
<p>But that underlying routine of life is precisely what I miss. </p>
<p>Most of the year we are moored to society by a scaffold of routine. Days and weeks are much the same: the commute to work or classes, checking e-mail and social media, attending meetings, running errands. Days may vary in the substance of what we write or teach or do, but the structure is familiar. Whether driving our own cars or riding our regular trains and subways, most of us inhabit a relatively small geographical and institutional space. We see the same people, watch the same channels, listen to the same radio programs day after day. We have our lives organized efficiently to get us what we need — a string of pleasant days. </p>
<p>The holidays disrupt this calm routine we have built our lives around. Not being at work can be disorienting in itself. Work is central to our lives. Many of us experience the paradox of thinking we want time off from work, but really missing it when we cannot go to the office. </p>
<p>We may also find our home routine disrupted during the holidays by visiting family members who require attention, special food, entertainment. They want to argue about last year’s election; they get on our nerves. There is nothing to watch on TV as our favorite programs are either all reruns or disappear for a month, replaced by predictable holiday shows. </p>
<p>Likewise with radio. Music stations turn to “Feliz Navidad,” “Last Christmas” and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Talk radio is all “The best of &#8230;” or repeats of old programs. Even news programs cheat by rerunning segments they showed us “ … back this summer” or filling the time with reports of awful weather and snarled traffic and crowded airports. </p>
<p>It is as though suddenly nothing is happening in the world. </p>
<p>Magazines and periodicals for December and January shrink to half their size, are combined into one issue and are filled with the year in photos, lists of celebrities who died in the past year and countless other lists of what happened in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>It is the actual holidays themselves that break most with routine, even in this 24/7 world, as many businesses and stores either close or shrink hours. The streets are almost devoid of traffic; everything seems to have shut down. All is quiet. Everyone seems to be enclosed within a house somewhere with all of their relatives, cars parked in driveways. There is almost nowhere to go, no place open to do errands and shop, no crowds to be lost in, no hustle and bustle of crowds on the street. Boredom sets in. </p>
<p>So in spite of the joys of the season, I am always happy somehow when they are over, and I can return to that day-to-day routine where most of life is led. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Relatives and supporters of Marcus Fischer, a Minneapolis teenager who was shot by city police in an interrogation room last week, converged on the Hennepin County Attorney&#8217;s Office on Tuesday to demand that his family be allowed to visit him without supervision in the hospital. </p>
<p>Fischer has been under guard as he recovers from multiple shots and what police say are self-inflicted stab wounds. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, his supporters filed into a courtroom at the Public Safety Facility, including his father, Eric Fischer, who sat in the front row, holding his head in his hands. When Judge Gina Brandt announced that his son would not be appearing for at least another day, Eric Fischer let out a muffled cry of frustration. </p>
<p>It was the second missed court appearance in a row after Marcus Fischer, 18, was kept from court on Friday for what a judge called &#8220;medical reasons.&#8221; His current condition wasn&#8217;t known on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Minutes after the announcement, the group, numbering several dozen, started toward County Attorney Mike Freeman&#8217;s office on the 20th floor of the county Government Center. They crammed the lobby of Freeman&#8217;s office and asked to speak to him. </p>
<p>Freeman declined to come out, but his spokesman, Chuck Laszewski, listened as they aired their grievances: that after an initial visit under police supervision, Fischer&#8217;s father and sister had been barred from seeing him. </p>
<p>Community activist Mel Reeves and other speakers demanded to know why they were given no advance warning that Fischer&#8217;s court date was being moved again. </p>
<p>&#8220;This office can make a request to [Hennepin County Sheriff Rich] Stanek,&#8221; Reeves, an outspoken critic of police misbehavior, told Laszewski. &#8220;Exceptions can be made, and what we&#8217;re asking for is an exception.&#8221; </p>
<p>Reeves said later that authorities had agreed to allow the family visitation rights. </p>
<p>The case has raised concerns over how police officers deal with people who are harming themselves. </p>
<p>After his arrest Dec. 18 on suspicion of involvement with a robbery and shooting, Fischer was brought to police headquarters for questioning. At one point, he was left unattended in an interview room. When detectives returned, they found him cutting himself with a large folding knife that he brought into the room in his waistband, according to authorities. When he ignored orders to put the weapon down, and a Taser didn&#8217;t stop him, officers shot him as he moved toward the door — even as a detective was still negotiating with Fischer, according to sources. </p>
<p>The two officers who fired their guns — Sgt. Gene Suker, a 20-year veteran of the department, and officer Jerome Carey, who has one year with the department — are on routine paid leave pending the outcome of a state investigation into the incident. So is officer David Martinson, an eight-year department veteran who deployed the Taser. </p>
<p>The entire encounter was caught on video, which police union officials say will show the officers acted justifiably when they opened fire. </p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union questioned whether police could have done more to defuse the situation. </p>
<p>&#8220;You would think that the police would recognize this as a mental health crisis … a situation that demands careful, nonviolent de-escalation techniques to keep everyone safe,&#8221; the group said in a blog post last week. </p>

        <title>University of Minnesota memo sparks war of words; officials say there&#8217;s no &#8216;War on Christmas&#8217;</title>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Advice on holiday parties was &#8220;ill-advised,&#8221; U admits.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Maura Lerner</h4>
<p>It was, officials say, an “ill-advised” attempt to spark a conversation about religious diversity at the University of Minnesota. </p>
<p>But last week, a memo about holiday parties in the agricultural college sparked a backlash on social media that left U officials scrambling to explain that they were not, in fact, part of any “war on Christmas.” </p>
<p>The memo, which was circulated at a Dec. 6 lunch meeting, cautioned against using decorations, music and food that are “specific to any one religion” on campus. It specifically cited Santa Claus, Christmas trees, dreidels, menorahs, doves and the colors red and green as “not appropriate for gatherings and displays at this time of year.” </p>
<p></p>
<div style="max-width: 550px;"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 123.0012%;"><a data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/O21tbrc" href="https://twitter.com/miltimore79/status/941125792360255488"></a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>A week later, <a href="http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/red-and-green-colors-not-appropriate-during-holiday-season-university-says">a story about the memo</a> ran on the website Intellectual Takeout, which quoted a law professor as saying: “This sounds like the university might be going a little bit berserk.”</p>
<p>From there, the news started spreading on conservative news sites like <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/40049/">the College Fix</a>, which delights in exposing political correctness on campus. “University memo: wrapped gifts, Santa, Christmas trees ‘not appropriate,’ ” ran the headline 10 days before Christmas.</p>
<p>The problem, says Evan Lapiska, a U spokesman, is that much of the coverage inaccurately portrayed the memo as official university policy. </p>
<p>“It was a well-intentioned but ill-advised attempt to spark a dialogue,” he said. “It was part of a lunch-hour discussion series that took on a life of its own.” The idea of banning Santa Claus or certain colors, he added, “is not something that the university would put forth or consider in any way, shape or form as potential policy.” </p>
<p>The memo, “Religious Diversity and Holidays,” was prepared for the Dec. 6 session of a program, known as Dean’s Dialogues, for students, faculty and staff in the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences. Only those who showed up received the handout, according to Lapiska. </p>
<p>It began: “We encourage units to recognize holidays in ways that are respectful of the diversity of the University community, and recommend the following for your consideration:” </p>
<p>Among the tips: “Keep the theme of any invitations neutral and nonreligious and not reflective of any one religious holiday.” In addition to Santa and other Christmas and Hanukkah symbols, the list of inappropriate items included angels, the star of Bethlehem, bows/wrapped gifts and bells. </p>
<p>Jon Miltimore, a senior editor at Intellectual Takeout, a Bloomington-based website, said he broke the story after a concerned U employee shared a copy of the handout. “It was a bit cloak and dagger,” he said. “The person was very adamant about remaining anonymous.” </p>
<p>While the university insists it’s not an official list of dos and don’ts, Miltimore said it could appear that way to employees. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure that the person that receives that letter understands the distinction,” he said. “We’re giving you this material and we’re telling you it’s inappropriate — but it’s not official policy?” </p>
<p>The story triggered a fair amount of outrage once it caught fire online. “I think probably because the document was so silly,” said Miltimore. “Saying certain colors are inappropriate, that Santa Claus is a religious icon. I think that’s what made the story [have] legs.” </p>
<p>Before long, strangers started posting “merry Christmas” on the university’s Facebook page, some with less than merry comments. “Boo!” wrote one man. “Go find a safe space and crawl into it.” </p>
<p>Lapiska, the U spokesman, argues that the story has been distorted in the retelling. “It’s very clear that it’s fed into a narrative that was convenient,” he said. But the U, he insists, is not waging war on Christmas. “If you’ve been on the U campus around the holidays, the gates of campus have red and green on them,” he said. Garlands abound. </p>
<p>Even President Eric Kaler made a joint appearance with Santa at the U’s cancer center. </p>
<p>Since the U started pushing back on the media accounts, some websites have updated their articles, declaring that the U was retracting the holiday restrictions. </p>
<p>Not so, says Lapiska. “There was no retraction, because there was never a restriction,” he said. </p>
<p>Still, “I think there’s certainly regret around how it has been characterized and perceived,” he said. “Certainly there will be a conversation, if it hasn’t already taken place, to see how we can learn from this moving forward and avoid a situation like this in the future.” </p>

The question of whether MNsure&#8217;s call-center failure in 2016 could have been the result of a saboteur is not as outlandish as it might sound.</div>
                                    </div>
<p>Just before Election Day in 2016, Minnesota’s health insurance exchange launched open enrollment. It was a debacle. </p>
<p>Within hours, the MNsure call center was deluged. As insurance shoppers complained of long wait times, Gov. Mark Dayton announced that the state’s IT division found that automated systems were flooding the phone lines. </p>
<p>“Somebody’s trying to jam the call center, and making robocalls to try to snafu the thing — which is deplorable,” Dayton said publicly at the time. </p>
<p>It was a striking claim: that a bad actor invested in seeing MNsure fail conspired to sabotage a system set up to help Minnesotans shop for health insurance. </p>
<p>Since that time, more than a year ago, Minnesotans have heard nothing more about it. </p>
<p>Minnesota IT Services (MNIT), the division that manages state computer networks, referred to its year-old statement on the incident, which said the investigation had been forwarded to the FBI. </p>
<p>The FBI declined to comment. </p>
<p>Dayton’s office responded to a broad public records request related to the incident by stating there is “no data responsive to your request.” </p>
<p>MNIT, responding to a similar request, released to the Star Tribune a brief e-mail chain from Nov. 23, 2016. </p>
<p>In an e-mail to an FBI agent, a MNIT investigator said there was no evidence the problem was internal. </p>
<p>“We have not been able to determine any legitimate, system-based explanation” for the incident, the state investigator wrote. </p>
<p>Dayton’s DFL Party tallied major losses in the election a week after the health insurance snafu and alleged hacking of the phone help line, the latest bad headlines about a continuing source of trouble for his administration. </p>
<p>Republicans and many consumers blamed changes to the health insurance market for premium increases of 50 percent or more in 2016. </p>
<p>And, since its rollout — fairly or not — the state health insurance exchange had become a symbol of government dysfunction and DFL overreach. </p>
<p>If Dayton was right, however, he was calling attention to a new and dark chapter in the nation’s increasing political polarization, this time manifested at the state level: sabotaging a duly elected government for partisan advantage. </p>
<p>“It’s a state analog to the Russia cybersabotage” of the 2016 presidential election, said Steven Schier, a Carleton College political scientist who has studied and written about partisan polarization. </p>
<p>The question of whether the call-center failure could have been the result of a saboteur, perhaps intending to embarrass Dayton’s DFL government a week before the election, is not as outlandish as it might sound. </p>
<p>While not commenting on this specific case, Michael Krause, FBI supervisory special agent, said attacks on government bodies from disgruntled employees and citizens are an emerging threat. </p>
<p>“They don’t like some political decision or public policy decision” and try to create mischief, he said. </p>
<p>R. David Edelman, former White House special assistant to the president for technology and now director of MIT’s Project on Technology, the Economy and National Security, said it’s easy to imagine an attack on MNsure. </p>
<p>“As a technical matter, it’s both highly plausible and reasonably simple — the sort of thing a [misguided] computer science undergrad could pull off with a couple of hours’ work,” he said. </p>
<p>In this scenario, the attacker would flood the system with data packets while masking the origin of the calls by making it seem like they were all coming from one number, a technique known as spoofing. </p>
<p>Michael Johnson, chair in Security Technologies at the University of Minnesota, emphasized he was merely speculating based on limited information. </p>
<p>But he said the incident was “more likely than not caused by a malicious party.” </p>
<p>Mark Lanterman, chief technology officer at Computer Forensics Services in Minnetonka, was more circumspect: “It wouldn’t be my first case in which a large project fails, heads are rolling and you need an explanation,” he said. </p>
<p>Whether the MNsure help line was sabotaged, the state should have been ready given the known vulnerabilities, Edelman said. </p>
<p>“The nature of a denial-of-service attack is that it’s a blunt instrument: crude and easy to put together, but also easy to overcome,” Edelman said. “That’s why it’s surprising that [state government] did not have a plan in place to defend its networks.” </p>
<p>Cambray Crozier, a spokeswoman for MNIT, said the state took steps this year to protect the MNsure open enrollment rollout, which was smoother than in years past. MNIT said the 2016 incident is evidence of the need for more state spending in cybersecurity. </p>
<p>“Nearly every government function that Minnesotans depend on is reliant on technology, but many of the systems we use today run on outdated, unsupported technology that makes them a prime target for attack,” said Aaron Call, the state’s chief information security officer. “Recognizing the growing threat, we have been advocating the critical need to modernize state systems and strengthen cyberdefenses to better protect Minnesotans.” </p>
<p>Now, Minnesota faces the prospect of political sabotage, which is commonplace in other parts of the world. </p>
<p>“It’s something we should be worried about,” Edelman said. “More than just politicians or parties, we’ve seen attempts to disrupt entire elections this way in Bulgaria and Ukraine. In other words, increasingly, a denial-of-service attack is on page one in the tyrant’s [or desperate politician’s] playbook.” </p>
<p>Not only is technology easily available, but the country’s tribal political mood, in which every election is portrayed as an apocalyptic event, will only encourage more attacks, Schier said: “We are in a broader environment of political polarization where this behavior is becoming more acceptable.” </p>
<p>Sabotage, Schier said, is a telling metaphor. </p>
<p>“It’s a military metaphor,” he said. “And military conflict usually involves spying and sabotage on both sides.” </p>
<p>If the MNsure phone line was sabotaged, can the crime be solved? </p>
<p>“There’s no perfect crime,” said the FBI’s Krause. </p>
<p>Kyle Loven, a former chief division counsel at the FBI in Minneapolis now at Computer Forensics Services, said attackers’ ability to conceal their digital fingerprints often make these crimes difficult to solve. </p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s virtually impossible,” he said. </p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — A plane heading from Los Angeles to Tokyo turned back because an unauthorized person was on board. </p>
<p>KABC-TV reports All Nippon Airways Flight 175 left Los Angeles International Airport around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, but it never arrived at Tokyo&#8217;s Narita International Airport. </p>
<p>Model Chrissy Teigen, who was on the plane, tweeted that the flight made a U-turn about four hours into the 11-hour flight. </p>

<p>Teigen says passengers were told that someone had managed to board the ANA flight with a United Airlines ticket. </p>
<p>The plane landed at LAX around 7:30 p.m. after eight hours in the air. </p>
<p>Teigen says police interviewed passengers who were sitting near the person. </p>
<p>Airport police tell KABC-TV that there was a &#8220;mix-up&#8221; that&#8217;s been resolved, and the flight has been rescheduled to depart Wednesday. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>LONDON — Former President Barack Obama told Prince Harry in an interview broadcast Wednesday that people in leadership roles must be careful in their use of social media and warned against spending too much time immersed in the internet at the expense of the world outside. </p>
<p>Obama did not, however, directly mention his successor, President Donald Trump, who has made the use of Twitter a centerpiece of his presidency. </p>
<p>&#8220;All of us in leadership have to find ways to recreate a common space on the internet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One of the dangers of the internet is people can have entirely different realities. They can be just cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.&#8221; </p>
<p>He spoke with Harry in the prince&#8217;s capacity as guest editor of the BBC Radio 4 news program. Both men said the interview, recorded in Canada in September, was Obama&#8217;s first since leaving the presidency in January. </p>
<p>Obama said he felt serene the day he left the White House at the end of his second four-year term despite the vast amount of work that remained unfinished. He said it was &#8220;hugely liberating&#8221; to be able to set his own agenda in the morning to have the time to talk with his wife, Michelle, now that he is no longer president. </p>
<p>&#8220;I miss the work itself because it was fascinating,&#8221; Obama said of his eight years in the Oval Office, citing his health care reforms as one of his proudest achievements. </p>
<p>In a brief live segment at the end of the show, Harry said he did not know if Obama would be on the guest list for his wedding in May to American actress Meghan Markle. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that, we haven&#8217;t even put the invite or the guest list together, who knows if he&#8217;s going to be invited or not,&#8221; Harry said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to ruin that surprise.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Sun newspaper, a popular tabloid, has suggested that the British government is concerned that Harry and Markle may invite the Obamas but not Trump, possibly straining ties between the two governments. </p>
<p>Harry did say his fiancee enjoyed her first Christmas with the royal family. </p>
<p>&#8220;The family loved having her there,&#8221; Harry said. </p>
<p>The prince used his position to ask Obama a &#8220;lightning round&#8221; of questions of the type normally asked of entertainers, not politicians. </p>
<p>The former president declined to say whether he wears boxers or briefs, preserving a bit of post-presidential dignity, but was willing to say he prefers Aretha Franklin to Tina Turner — &#8220;Aretha is the best,&#8221; he said of the Queen of Soul — and favors retired basketball star Michael Jordan over current phenom LeBron James. </p>
<p>Obama rejected gloomy prognostications about the state of the world, saying that in many ways the world is healthier and wealthier than it has ever been, making it perhaps the best time in human history to be born. </p>
<p>He cited improved treatment of African-Americans and greatly expanded opportunities for young women as achievements of the past few generations that give him hope for the future. </p>
<p>Harry also interviewed his father, Prince Charles, who offered a more downbeat assessment. He said the root causes of climate change are not being addressed even as it caused &#8220;untold horrors&#8221; in different parts of the world. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">The home was destroyed, and a cause for the blaze has yet to be revealed.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Paul Walsh</h4>
<p>A Christmas Day house fire in Marshall, Minn., killed one person, the Fire Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The blaze engulfed the home about 1:30 p.m. Monday in the 600 block of Elaine Avenue, a fire official said. </p>
<p>The resident who died has yet to be identified, and no one else was reported harmed. </p>
<p>Fire officials consider the home to be a total loss. What led to the fire remains under investigation. </p>
<p>Since Christmas, there have been at least five deaths in house fires in Minnesota. Four people died after a home <a href="http://www.startribune.com/hibbing-house-fire-kills-2-adults-badly-injures-2-children/466606123/">caught fire in Hibbing</a> on Tuesday, and a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/1-killed-in-lakeville-house-fire-2-flee-the-flames/466647113/">blaze in a Lakeville house</a> claimed one life Tuesday. Preliminary indications of how those fires began also have yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>BEIJING — The Chinese owner of Sweden&#8217;s Volvo Cars is buying a stake in truck manufacturer AB Volvo, expanding a portfolio of vehicle brands that includes shares in Malaysia&#8217;s Proton and Britain&#8217;s Lotus. </p>
<p>Geely Holding Group said Wednesday the acquisition of shares from Cevian Capital, a fund manager, would give it 8.2 percent of Volvo&#8217;s share capital and 15.6 percent of voting rights. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed, though analysts estimated the value of the deal at around 27 billion kronor ($3.3 billion). </p>
<p>The Swedish company, which also makes buses, construction equipment and diesel engines, was the parent of Volvo Cars until 1999, when it was sold to Ford Motor Co. Geely bought Volvo Cars in 2010. </p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize and value the proud Scandinavian history and culture, leading market positions, breakthrough technologies and environmental capabilities of AB Volvo,&#8221; said Geely chairman Li Shufu in a statement. </p>
<p>The transaction will make Geely the biggest single shareholder in Volvo and the second biggest holder of voting rights. Christer Gardell, the co-founder of Cevian Capital, said Geely would be able to provide Volvo with valuable access to the Chinese market and know-how in the field of electric and self-driving vehicles. </p>
<p>Li said Geely would support Volvo management&#8217;s current strategy. </p>
<p>Geely owns Geely Auto, one of China&#8217;s biggest independent automakers. It agreed in May to buy 49.9 percent of Proton and 51 percent of Lotus, which was owned by the Malaysian automaker. </p>
<p>Geely also launched a new brand, Lynk &amp; Co., in 2016. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Ben Goessling</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-13408" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, who’s been one of the surprise stories of the 2017 NFL season, will be a free agent in March and is in line for a significant raise next year because of how he’s played while leading the Vikings to a NFC North title. </p>
<p>The fact Keenum has been the Vikings’ starting quarterback for most of this season has him set to earn a little extra money this year, too. </p>
<p>According to sources with access to NFLPA salary data, Keenum would make an extra $250,000 if he plays 85 percent or more of the Vikings’ offensive plays this season. Keenum, who’s played 90.4 percent of the team’s offensive snaps this year, would hit the bonus if he starts on Sunday. He’d earn $150,000 if he plays 75 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps, but with the team still trying to secure a first-round bye against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Keenum figures to play. </p>
<p>He’d also add to a per-game roster bonus that pays him $46,875 each time he’s on the 46-man active roster on game day. Keenum has been active for every game this season, and would maximize his roster bonus at $750,000 if he’s active on Sunday. If he starts and plays most of the Vikings’ snaps, his bonuses and incentives for the season would total $1 million, in addition to $950,000 base salary, $250,000 signing bonus and $50,000 workout bonus. </p>
<p>That’d give Keenum a total of $2.25 million for the season. In any case, he’s going to end the year as a major bargain for the Vikings. But as the team turned to him, it also gave the quarterback a chance to earn a little extra cash. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at several other Vikings players who have a shot at incentives and roster bonuses in the regular-season finale. </p>
<p><strong>G Joe Berger: </strong>Can earn an extra $900,000 if he plays 90 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps (Berger has missed just two snaps all season). Berger can also cap out his per-game roster bonus at a total of $250,000 by being on the active roster for the 16th time this season on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>WR Michael Floyd: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $171,875 by being active for his 11th game.</p>
<p><strong>LB Emmanuel Lamur: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>LS Kevin McDermott: </strong>Will likely end the season with per-game roster bonuses of $23,437.50, given the fact he’s expected to miss Sunday’s game with a dislocated left shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>RB Latavius Murray: </strong>Can reach a $500,000 incentive, as well as a $500,000 salary escalator for 2018, by rushing for 169 yards on Sunday and finishing with 900 yards for the season. Can earn another $46,875 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season to tal to $750,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>CB Terence Newman: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Newman, who’s played 56 percent of the Vikings’ defensive snaps this season, is likely to fall short of a $150,000 incentive for playing 65 percent of the Vikings’ defensive plays.</p>
<p><strong>TE Kyle Rudolph: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Rudolph, who has 56 catches this season, won’t hit a $375,000 salary escalator for 2018 by reaching 80 catches this year, but already triggered one for next season by catching 83 passes last year.</p>
<p><strong>PR Marcus Sherels: </strong>Can earn a $100,000 incentive if he finishes the regular season as the NFL leader in punt return average. Sherels, who is currently sixth in the league with an average of 10 yards per punt, would need a prolific day to vault up the standings; the Lions’ Jamal Agnew currently leads the league with a 16.0 average.</p>
<p><strong>S Harrison Smith: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>WR Adam Thielen: </strong>Can earn a $1 million salary escalator for 2018 by catching five passes on Sunday, bringing his season total to 90 catches. Thielen has already secured a $750,000 salary escalator for next year by reaching 80 catches.</p>
<p><strong>WR Jarius Wright: </strong>Can make another $93,750 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $1.5 million by being on the 53-man roster for his 16th game. Wright restructured his deal with the Vikings before the season, taking a $1.05 million base salary instead of the $2.5 million he was scheduled to receive and converting $1.5 million to per-game bonuses. The restructuring came just before roster cuts at the end of the preseason.</p>
<p>Wright caught just 11 passes last season; with rookies Rodney Adams and Stacy Coley on the team’s initial 53-man roster, and Floyd set to join the team in October after a four-game suspension, the Vikings clearly wanted to retain some flexibility with the 28-year-old. The team wasn’t in a tight cap situation, and players don’t usually agree to convert base salaries to week-to-week bonuses unless they believe they’re at risk of not earning the money at all. </p>
<p>But Adams eventually wound up on the practice squad; Coley has played 27 snaps this season, and Floyd has caught only 10 passes for 78 yards. Wright has 18 catches for 178 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He could have to fight to stick around again in 2018, when his base salary is scheduled to jump back to $3.6 million, but he’s handled his role without griping and continued to prove his value. </p>

<p>After the first two-interception game of his career, Vikings safety Harrison Smith has been named the NFC Defensive Player of the Week. </p>
<p>Smith picked off two passes in the Vikings’ 13-0 win over the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night, stepping in front of a Brett Hundley throw to thwart the Packers’ best chance to score in the first half and sealing the game with a sideline interception in the fourth quarter. He also posted eight tackles, including one for loss, and broke up two passes. </p>
<p>The safety, who was not named to his third Pro Bowl despite his role in the league’s top-ranked defense, has matched his career high with five interceptions this season, while recording 1 1/2 sacks and 72 combined tackles. </p>
<p>He is the third Vikings player to win NFC Player of the Week honors this season, and the first on the defensive side of the ball to claim the honor; Sam Bradford was the NFC Offensive Player of the Week in Week 1, and Kai Forbath won NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors in Week 7. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>The engagement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has dominated the covers of supermarket tabloids since it was announced in November. And it’s likely to stay that way until they get married in May. </p>
<p>Which raises a question that comes up every time a member of the British royal family walks down the aisle: Why are Americans so obsessed with this topic? </p>
<p>After all, as an op-ed in the Washington Post argued recently, the Founding Fathers “violently overthrew our tea-sipping stamp-taxing overlords in large part so that we should not have to genuflect in front of the altar of royal bloodlines.” Right? </p>
<p>Yet Americans do love a British royal wedding. In 2011, they reacted with similar excitement to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. And the whole country stopped to watch Prince Charles and Princess Diana get married. </p>
<p>These bouts of monarch-mania in the former colonies have played out in a pop-culture environment shaped by imported shows like “Downton Abbey” and “The Crown.” We appear to be living in a golden age of American Anglophilia. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama even remarked upon it in 2015. “I think it’s fair to say that the American people are quite fond of the royal family,” Obama said during a White House visit from Prince Charles. “They like them much more than they like their own politicians.” </p>

<p>So what is the appeal? Observers of American Anglophilia say it is complicated. </p>
<p>Tom Sykes, an Englishman in Dublin who writes about the royal family for the Daily Beast, described the royals as the ultimate celebrities, albeit ones with “some meat on the bone.” </p>
<p>“I do think if you’re going to be interested in celebrities you don’t know,” Sykes said, “the royal family are probably more interesting people to be interested in than the Kardashians, say, because of the thousand years of history behind them.” </p>
<p>Glamour and escapism are a big part of the allure. It also helps that the British royal family does not play any formal role, ceremonial or otherwise, in American life. As such, they are insulated from the criticism about the cost of maintaining a monarchy — $57.6 million in taxpayer money during the 2016-17 fiscal year — that some in Britain criticize as out of touch. </p>
<p>Suzanne Mackie, executive producer of “The Crown,” attributed the royal family’s appeal in part to “the mystique, the mythology around the throne and the monarchy.” </p>
<p>That interest is very British-centric. </p>
<p>“Americans are particularly interested in the British monarchy, it’s not just monarchy in general,” said Arianne Chernock, a historian at Boston University. “You don’t see the same kind of interest directed at the Japanese Crown. I think it is about this special relationship, at root.” </p>
<p>Anglophilia in the United States dates back to “almost immediately after the American Revolution” ended British rule, Chernock said. “There is a desire to retain that strong cultural tie, and I think that persists to this day.” </p>
<p>It is a feeling that has long cut across the social divide. In 1860, when Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, visited the United States on the eve of the Civil War, hundreds of thousands gathered to see him, said Elisa Tamarkin, a scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>
<p>“The love of this 18-year-old traveling prince was described as a universal feeling,” Tamarkin said. “South Carolina had committed to secede if Abraham Lincoln won, Wall Street was in a panic, but the Prince of Wales was actually on the cover of Harper’s Weekly five times in six weeks.” </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Associated Press</h4>
<p>STROUDSBURG, Pa. — A Pennsylvania police officer has pleaded guilty to a plot to blackmail his wife over having sex with a 14-year-old boy while she has pleaded guilty to plotting to kill her husband. </p>
<p>Keith Transue, a Bushkill Township officer, pleaded guilty last week to misdemeanor criminal coercion, and Robin Transue pleaded guilty to felony solicitation to commit aggravated assault and statutory sexual assault. The Mount Pocono residents, both 43, are scheduled for sentencing March 20. </p>
<p>Authorities in Monroe County said in court documents that Robin Transue told an informant her husband threatened to expose her 2010 relationship with the boy if she left him. Prosecutors say she suggested several ways to kill her husband, including a drug overdose or a hunting accident. </p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Transue freely talked about arranging for her husband&#8217;s murder,&#8221; District Attorney Michael Mancuso said. &#8220;All kinds of potential death scenarios were discussed.&#8221; </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Keith Transue failed to report the abuse when he learned about it, as he was legally obligated to do as a police officer. </p>
<p>&#8220;Transue was using his wife&#8217;s crime to keep her from leaving or divorcing him. This in turn was essentially the motive for Robin soliciting Keith&#8217;s murder,&#8221; Mancuso said. </p>
<p>The police department placed Keith Transue on leave after the charges were filed, and Police Chief Mike McLouth said Wednesday said the officer had submitted a resignation letter. </p>
<p>Mancuso praised an informant who came forward and cooperated with police, saying he &#8220;likely prevented a homicide and also brought to light a sordid history of sexual assault and criminal coercion.&#8221; </p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — A Tokyo-bound flight returned to Los Angeles hours into the journey after the crew discovered that one of the passengers had boarded the wrong plane, All Nippon Airways said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The pilot of Flight 175 decided to return to the originating airport as part of the airline&#8217;s security procedures, ANA said in statements that apologized to passengers but supported the decision. </p>
<p>The flight left Los Angeles International Airport at 11:36 a.m. Tuesday and returned at 7:33 p.m. </p>
<p>Model Chrissy Teigen and her singer husband, John Legend, were aboard and she live-tweeted the developments. She wondered on Twitter why the plane was turning around four hours into the 11-hour flight. </p>
<p>&#8220;Why did we all get punished for this one person&#8217;s mistake? Why not just land in Tokyo and send the other person back? How is this the better idea, you ask? We all have the same questions,&#8221; she wrote. </p>
<p>Teigen also tweeted photos, videos and updates as they waited to resume the trip. </p>
<p>&#8220;Taking off!!!&#8221; she finally tweeted early Wednesday. </p>
<p>FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency conducted interviews Tuesday night but made no arrest. She said no charges were filed, but the investigation is ongoing. </p>
<p>A U.S. government official with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that the incident involved two brothers — one ticketed on ANA and the other on a United Airlines flight leaving about the same time. </p>
<p>The official who spoke on condition of anonymity says both cleared security and had valid boarding passes. ANA and United are codeshare partners. </p>
<p>ANA said it was trying to determine how the passenger boarded the wrong flight. </p>
<p>&#8220;At the time during the flight, the pilot in command was presented with information about the discrepancy in the passenger manifest. Based on the available information in flight, he made the correct decision to return to LAX,&#8221; ANA said. </p>
<p>The airline said it supported the pilot&#8217;s decision &#8220;out of the abundance of caution and safety for the passengers and crew.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;ANA would like to express its apologies to the passengers for the inconvenience,&#8221; the airline said. &#8220;We take great pride providing exemplary customer service, and on this flight we failed to do so.&#8221; </p>

<p>The National Football League is on message with the Bold North theme for Super Bowl LII ane then some in a television commercial called, &#8220;The Will to Survive.&#8221; </p>
<p>The 30-second spot features NFL stars such as Von Miller, Earl Thomas and Dak Prescott, trudging through a snowy, frozen mountain pass landscape, wind howling fiercely as a cloudy image of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in his uniform briefly appears in the dark sky. </p>
<p>The players wear furs, heavy boots and carry hiking sticks looking ready to step into a gnarly story arc on HBO&#8217;s Game of Thrones series. Maybe I missed it, but I didn&#8217;t see any Minnesota Vikings featured in the spot. </p>
<p>The ad culminates with an image of U.S. Bank Stadium, aglow in purples and blues, atop a mountain off in the middle distance. Message: It&#8217;s going to take all you&#8217;ve got to get into the game Feb. 4. </p>
<p>Watch the spot here: <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wsP_/nfl-the-will-to-survive-featuring-dak-prescott-von-miller#">https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wsP_/nfl-the-will-to-survive-featuring-dak-prescott-von-miller#</a></p>
<p>The lead-up events start in less than a month on Jan. 26 with Super Bowl Live on Nicollet Mall. In the coming days, expect to see an increasing presence of Super Bowl ads around town featuring the theme colors of blue, purple and green, evoking the Northern Lights. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope the weather isn&#8217;t as imposing as it appears to be in the ad or as it actually is this week. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Rand</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-7112" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/randball/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/27104121/mcvay.jpg">Week 17 in the NFL is a weird mix of teams with nothing to play for but pride, others with plenty on the line and a few who have a little bit to play for but are more interested in answering the question of whether it’s more important to keep momentum going into the postseason or more important to give key players a week of rest.</p>
<p>In the NFC, there are some obvious teams who fall into these categories. </p>
<p>The Eagles are locked into the No. 1 seed and can decide whether to rest players or try to keep them focused knowing that they can rest the following week since they’ve earned a bye. </p>
<p>The Vikings are still working to clinch the No. 2 seed, and the easiest way to do that is to beat the Bears on Sunday. The Saints can clinch their division with a win over Tampa, while Carolina can steal the division instead with a win over Atlanta. The Falcons, too, can clinch a wild card spot with a win. </p>
<p>So the Vikings, Saints and Panthers have plenty to play for, while at least the Vikings and Saints opponents, the Bears and Tampa, have nothing but pride at stake. </p>
<p>In the weird middle, though, are the Rams. They’ve already clinched their division and sit at 11-4. With a win, they can lock up the No. 3 seed, but they can do no better than that. With a loss, they would fall no further than the No. 4 seed. In both cases, they’d have a home playoff game to start the postseason. </p>
<p>With nothing more than seeding at stake, it sounds as though the Rams are giving heavy consideration to <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000899051/article/sean-mcvay-rams-to-rest-some-starters-in-week-17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resting a bunch of starters for Sunday’s finale against the 49ers</a>.</p>
<p>“Being locked into that third or fourth seed — every single game is important — but I think it will provide an opportunity for us to potentially get some guys healthier, rest them, give some other guys a chance to step up,” head coach Sean McVay said Tuesday. </p>
<p>That decision could impact how the NFC playoff picture shakes out, and by extension could impact the Vikings. </p>
<p>A Rams win, as noted, would make them the No. 3 seed and put them on course to play either Seattle or Atlanta (the teams battling for the No. 6 seed) in the wild card round. If the Rams won that game, they would play the No. 2 seed in the division round — the spot that the Vikings will claim unless four different things go wrong Sunday. Even if New Orleans won Sunday, the Saints would be the No. 4 seed and would face Carolina in the wild card round. The winner of that game, assuming the No. 3 seed Rams won their game, would face Philadelphia. </p>
<p>But if the Rams lose and New Orleans wins Sunday, the Rams would be the No. 4 seed. New Orleans would be No. 3. And if both won in the wild card round, the Saints would play the Vikings (assuming they hold down the No. 2 seed) and the Rams would face the Eagles. The Rams could still defeat the 49ers Sunday even while resting players, but L.A. at full strength certainly has a better chance of doing that. </p>
<p>So McVay’s decision could be about giving players rest. It could also be about creating a potentially easier path in the playoffs. Who would you rather line up to face if you were the Rams: Carolina at home and Philly on the road or Seattle/Atlanta at home and the Vikings on the road? I’d pick the first one given how the Eagles have looked without Carson Wentz. </p>
<p>Either way, the Vikings would have a tough matchup in the division round if either New Orleans or the Rams advanced as the No. 3 seed. It’s entirely possible, of course, that one or both will lose, shaking up the seeding even more. Remember, the team with the worst remaining seed after the wild card round faces the No. 1 seed, while the better of the two faces the No. 2 seed. </p>
<p>And yes, the Vikings still need to secure that No. 2 seed. It’s worth noting on that front that the Rams’ decision could play a role in that as well. Though it shouldn’t come to this, the Vikings can still claim the No. 2 seed even with a loss to the Bears at home Sunday if New Orleans wins … or Carolina loses … or the Rams win. </p>
<p>If you thought the Rams game against the 49ers was a strong line of defense against catastrophe, it feels less like that if L.A. is resting a bunch of players. </p>

<p>A rare pour-your-own beer concept is coming to Minneapolis’ North Loop this spring. </p>
<p>First Draft Taproom &amp; Kitchen (324 6th Av. N., Mpls., <a href="https://www.firstdraft.beer/">firstdraft.beer</a>), a self-serve bar that started in Denver, will offer 54 taps, heavily featuring local brews, at its Twin Cities location.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: When patrons arrive, the staff will check their ID, swipe a credit card to start a tab, and hand them a tap card. </p>
<p>From there, drinkers set their own pace and determine how much — or how little — they’d like to consume. Each tap will be accompanied by a tablet with information about the brew. Using the card, patrons can pour as little as an ounce — prices range from about 40 cents to $1.20 per ounce — or as much as a full pint. </p>
<p>A similar concept, Union 32 Crafthouse, debuted in Eagan earlier this year. </p>

<p>“I was just at the point where I was inundated with all the new styles and the new beers that everyone was producing,” said First Draft founder Mark Slattery, who is partnering with Minnesota locals Andrew Valen and Joe Maselter. “If a place has 100 beers on tap, well, you have to pick a pint but you’re not sure what you like and if it’s worth the price. With [First Draft], it’s just a fun, centralized spot to come in and try all the state’s beers.” </p>
<p>Slattery said First Draft will purchase just one keg at a time of each beer, so the lineup will be constantly changing. A handful of ciders and wine will be on tap, as well. Locally inspired food, including walleye sandwiches, burgers and charcuterie plates, can be ordered at a walk-up counter. </p>

        <title>Timberwolves unveil gray &#8216;City Edition&#8217; uniform</title>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Chris Miller</h4>
<p>Just in time for the fourth day of Christmas, the Timberwolves unveiled their fourth and final uniform &#8212; the City Edition &#8212; on Wednesday. </p>
<p>And here it is: </p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/cmiller_1514395884_grayagain.jpg"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The uniform will debut on Feb. 1 when the Wolves play the Bucks at Target Center. </p>
<p>According to a team press release: <em> The Timberwolves City Edition uniform follows the theme of “Bold North” which celebrates the area hosting Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018. The strength and civic pride of this region will be on full display over the next few months, which has been an inspiration for the design of the team’s City Edition uniforms. The primary color celebrates the tonal gray winter coat of the wolf, while the white mimics the snow-covered land that is the North. The color allows the Wolf to reflect its surroundings and be an apex predator while camouflaging and protecting the wolf, which is reflective of the “New Era” of Timberwolves basketball – hungry and determined to break through and establish a winning culture. The pattern of the jersey is representative of the wolf’s guard hair during the winter months, which represents our fans willingness to defend our team and home court.</em><br>
 <br>
The City Edition also will be worn April 5 at Denver, April 6 at the Lakers and at the home finale April 11 against Denver.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>In county tax offices Wednesday across Minnesota, long lines snaked from counters and urgent phone calls poured in from that rarest of all creatures: Property owners who wanted to pay their taxes early. </p>
<p>“It’s a last shot at the deduction,” said Mark Chapin, director of Hennepin County’s Resident and Real Estate Services. “The demand to prepay is something we’ve never seen before and don’t expect to happen again.” </p>
<p>The rush was prompted by the newly enacted federal tax law that, after Jan. 1, will cap the annual state and local tax deduction at $10,000. </p>
<p>That’s a change that could cost some taxpayers thousands of dollars. And it’s the reason why Hennepin County officials decided to extend the hours they will accept prepayments on 2018 property taxes and set up the county’s website to take payments online. </p>
<p>As of late Wednesday, Hennepin County had received $47 million in prepaid property taxes. <span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">In comparison, the county received about $6 million in prepayments in all of 2016.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Nearly 500 people have been coming in person each day to prepay their taxes, said Derrick Hodge</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">, the county’s resident services administrative manager in the Property Tax Division.</span></p>

<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">“It’s the most excited I’ve seen people come in and pay taxes,” he said. One example was taxpayer David Anderson,</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body"> who had a fairly hefty check in hand on the advice of his accountant — and said he was happy to turn it over.</span></p>
<p>The race to prepay is trending across the nation. <span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">While the federal tax law specifically prohibited prepayment of income taxes to avoid the new limits, it didn’t include any language on early payment of property taxes. That means that property </span>taxes paid before Tuesday — New Year’s Day — can be deducted on 2017 returns, up to the amount stated on the truth-in-taxation notices sent out in November.</p>
<h3><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Things were ‘blowing up’</span></h3>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Because Hennepin County is home to 420,000 taxable property parcels and more than 20 percent of the state’s population, Chapin wasn’t surprised that it would see the most significant number of people wanting to prepay their bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">To accommodate demand, the county has temporarily moved its tax payment services from the sixth floor of the Government Center in downtown Minneapolis to the skyway level, so people won’t have to go through weapons screening.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Beyond Hennepin, each of the metro area’s six other core counties also were experiencing an uptick in tax payments this week. Ramsey County had handled 893 prepayments since Tuesday, compared to 418 in 2016. Anoka and Dakota counties, which combined had collected nearly $8 million in property taxes, shifted staffers to handle the increased workload.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">None of the metro counties beyond Hennepin extended the hours they will accept prepayments. But business was booming nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">“My phone is blowing up,” said Pam LeBlanc</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">, Anoka County’s director of property records and taxation. “We are seeing double the amount of people who want to make early payments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Outstate, Wabasha County, on the Mississippi River southeast of the metro area, had taken in $100,000 in prepaid taxes by 2 p.m. Tuesday</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">; it collected $139,000 in prepaid taxes in all of 2016</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">. Olmsted County, also dealing with a steady stream of eager taxpayers, took in $600,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Dozens have called or e-mailed the St. Louis County Auditor’s Office this week wanting to pay their taxes early. Others have mailed in checks for the amount listed on their property tax statements, even though that amount is just an estimate based on the preliminary budgets of the various taxing jurisdictions; the actual amount due won’t be known until taxes are calculated and established in late February 2018.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">“Our current cashiering and property tax software doesn’t allow us to provide a receipt showing that property taxes are prepaid,” said St. Louis County Auditor Don Dicklich.</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body"> “And it’s not possible for us to make that sort of procedural or software change in the final two weeks of the year. We can provide a receipt showing that we received a payment on a specific date, but not that the payment is for 2018 taxes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">Other questions may arise, such as whether prepaying taxes might subject a taxpayer to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax. Chapin stressed that the county’s top priority is to make the taxpaying experience go as smoothly as possible rather than address specific tax concerns. Dicklich said that officials can’t give legal advice on whether early payment will help a person’s tax situation, or offer early refunds if it doesn’t benefit the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">“I would recommend a person consult a professional tax accountant for that advice,” Dicklich said.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">As Hennepin officials developed a plan to handle the rush of taxpayers, Chapin said he ran things by several commissioners. Getting enough staffers together during the holidays wasn’t easy, he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">There will be some overtime costs to cover staffers who are working extended hours, but Chapin said he expected that expense to be covered by the folks who park Saturday in the typically closed ramp.</span></p>
<p><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">The significant amount of prepayment money actually can create a potential investment income benefit, said County Administrator David Hough</span><span class="Text_BoldOff_Body">. County funds are managed and invested in a diversified investment portfolio, he said.</span></p>

                                    </div>
<p>The last time <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Zach Parise</strong> was in the minors was during the 2004-05 NHL lockout.</p>
<p>Well, 12 years later, he’s making his triumphant return. </p>
<p>The veteran Wild forward likely will play Thursday night with the American Hockey League Iowa Wild against the Rockford IceHogs in Des Moines. Parise has been practicing with the big club recently as part of his recovery from a late October microdiscectomy surgery. </p>
<p>He missed most of training camp and all of season so far because of the injury and surgery, so now that he has recently gotten the OK for full contact, this will be his first game. </p>
<p>“Even on that eight-day trip, we practiced one time. When you’re not on a line, these guys have to get ready to play games, and when you’re not on a line, it’s tough to get reps,” Parise said Wednesday at Xcel Energy Center. “So I think this would probably be the best thing to move forward to go there, practice with them, play a game and go from there. </p>
<p>“I talked to a good friend of mine who missed camp as well and missed a good chunk of games, and he said in hindsight that he wished he had gone down and played some games and gotten in shape and then stepped in,” Parise said. </p>
<p>“It takes awhile to catch back up to the conditioning level, the endurance level that these guys are at. It doesn’t happen overnight, and you can skate by yourself as much as you want, but you have to get in those games and get those reps in. And so it just made the most sense that it would be a good starting point.” </p>
<p>Parise said after Thursday’s game, he plans to come back up to Minnesota and practice with the Wild on Friday. But that’s as far as he’s planned. Coach <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> Bruce Boudreau</strong> said he hoped to see Parise’s return sometime “very early in the new year.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m not doing the back-to-back, I know that,” Parise said, as Iowa also plays Friday at Rockford. “I did look at that, though, I did consider it, but we just thought we didn’t know how good of an idea that would be maybe to play and then hop on a bus for five hours and play the next night. Work a little slower than that.” </p>
<p>The Wild’s highest-paid star joked about packing his gear because he’d been “sent down,” but his memories from his last stint in the minors are actually pretty fond. </p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s changed a little bit since then,” Parise said. “It was awesome. The league was really good. It was, I’m not joking. Each team had probably six or seven [NHL] regulars.” </p>
<h3><strong>Pitlick party</strong></h3>
<p>At least for one night, one Pitlick has a chance to upstage the other in Minnesota </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tyler Pitlick</strong>, a former Centennial High School standout, will play in his home state Wednesday as a forward for the Dallas Stars. But these days, it’s usually his younger cousin <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Rem Pitlick</strong>, a sophomore forward for the Gophers, who snags the spotlight.</p>
<p>“Our family’s a hockey family, and it’s definitely cool to see him doing so well,” Tyler Pitlick said. “I mean, I think he’s leading in goals and points over there &#8230; drafted by Nashville. And it’ll be pretty cool to get to play against him some day.” </p>
<p>Pitlick said he texts with his cousin every now and then, mostly when Rem asks him for advice on how to balance school and hockey. Pitlick joked that he’s not actually the best source for that, since he lasted only a season at Minnesota State. But according to Pitlick, Rem is one of the most hard working and dedicated players he’s seen, so he should be just fine. </p>
<p>Tyler Pitlick, who joined the Stars from Edmonton this past summer, said he wasn’t sure if his cousin would be one of the 50 or so family and friends coming to see the game against the Wild on Wednesday. But Pitlick already has received probably the most Minnesota welcome of all since he’s been home throughout the Christmas break. </p>
<p>“It was minus-5, and I got together with a couple buddies yesterday and got out on the outdoor rink to get my legs moving,” Pitlick said. “That’s the part that I think’s so special.” </p>
<h3><strong>Hanzal’s back</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s how <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Martin Hanzal</strong> summed up his time with the Wild: “It was short.”</p>
<p>Well, he was only here for a grand total of 20 games last season after a February trade from the Arizona Coyotes. And while it lasted just a few months before he signed with Dallas this past summer, the veteran winger said he still remembers how the fans were so into every small play. </p>
<p>With a rival team now in the stacked Central Division, Hanzal said he’s enjoyed being one of several additions who have helped reshape the Stars. </p>
<p>“It’s a lot of new stuff, you know, a lot of new tactics,” Hanzal said. </p>
<p>“And even the older guys like [ <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jason</strong>] <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Spezza</strong>, <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jamie</strong> [<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Benn</strong>], [<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tyler Seguin</strong>], they were here, but the new coach, he brought in all new stuff.</p>
<p>“So you have to adapt to that. But I think we are lately playing better, so it’s been fun.” </p>
<h3><strong>Etc.</strong></h3>
<p>• Winger <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Nino Niederreiter</strong> still is out because of a foot or ankle injury he endured before the break. He did not practice Wednesday. But Boudreau said he was hopeful the forward would practice Thursday.</p>
<p>• Goaltender <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Devan Dubnyk </strong>did practice Wednesday and was on the bench as the backup for <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Alex Stalock </strong>in the Dallas game. Dubnyk likely will play at some point this weekend after missing six games because of a lower-body injury.</p>

                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Sam Bradford</strong> is expected to return to Vikings practice next week, according to coach <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Mike Zimmer</strong>, which is a step toward the veteran quarterback possibly being activated from injured reserve during the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Vikings placed Bradford on injured reserve Nov. 8, a day after he underwent surgery on his ailing left knee. The operation reportedly cleaned up cartilage and smoothed a bone spur, per ESPN’s <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Chris Mortensen</strong>.</p>
<p>“He’s been working out, doing things, getting on the field,” Zimmer said Wednesday. “He’s throwing the ball, doing workouts. I haven’t seen him. I’ve seen him, but I haven’t seen him work out.” </p>
<p>Bradford was first eligible to return to Vikings practice last week, when he reached the required six-week stay on injured reserve. But the Vikings will hold him out of practice until next week, when he’s actually eligible to return to play. </p>
<p>With a win Sunday against the Bears, the Vikings earn the NFC’s No. 2 seed and first-round bye, giving the coaching and athletic training staffs extra time to assess Bradford’s possible return in the playoffs. </p>

<p></p>
<p>“We’ll see when he practices,” Zimmer said. </p>
<p>Bradford, whose contract expires in March, has played six quarters for the Vikings this season. Two quarters came after he injured his left knee — which has previously undergone two ACL repairs — while starring in the Week 1 win against the Saints. He returned in Week 5 in Chicago, looking unable to move well while taking four sacks and completing five of 11 passes for 36 yards. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Case Keenum</strong> replaced Bradford 25 seconds before halftime in Chicago and led the Vikings to a 20-17 win. Keenum is 10-3 as the Vikings’ starter this season.</p>
<h3><strong>New play-caller is an option again</strong></h3>
<p>Zimmer again is considering handing off defensive play calling to coordinator <strong style="font-weight: 500;">George Edwards</strong> after this season ends. Zimmer considered the switch last offseason when evaluating ways he could be a better head coach on game days.</p>
<p>“He really does everything for me, other than I call the plays on Sunday,” Zimmer said during a conference call with Chicago reporters on Wednesday. “But I may change that next year.” </p>
<p>This is Zimmer’s 18th NFL season calling plays, which he’s alluded to as one of his strengths. The numbers back that up. The Vikings are the NFL’s No. 1 scoring defense entering the final regular-season game. Minnesota has ranked no worse than 11th since hiring Zimmer. </p>
<p>“You know, I don’t know,” Zimmer said when asked why he’d delegate play calling. “It’s a lot of work when you sit down and do it. I’ve done it for a long time. And because I have confidence in George, as well. I think maybe just the fact that, um, you know, I don’t know — I guess I’m just getting older.” </p>
<h3><strong>Elflein held out </strong></h3>
<p>Center <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Pat Elflein</strong> was unable to practice Wednesday because of a left shoulder injury that has bothered him since the Vikings’ Dec. 3 win in Atlanta. Elflein missed one game and has started twice since.</p>
<p>Defensive tackle <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Shamar Stephen</strong> (ankle), long snapper <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kevin McDermott</strong> (shoulder) and cornerback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tramaine Brock</strong> (foot) were also held out of practice. Tight end <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kyle Rudolph</strong> (ankle) and cornerback <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Terence Newman</strong> (non-injury) were limited.</p>
<h3><strong>Smith honored</strong></h3>
<p>Safety <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Harrison Smith</strong> was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week after he led the Vikings with eight tackles and two interceptions in Green Bay. It’s Smith’s first such honor of his career and the Vikings’ eighth defensive player of the week award in four seasons under the current coaching staff.</p>

<p>Gift wrap from weeks of celebrations has been tossed. Our house is in relatively good order. Traffic to work remains temporarily (and blessedly) light. </p>
<p>It’s time, thus, to revisit one of my favorite annual traditions: reviewing a year’s worth of columns to catch up with folks whose stories I’ve told here. This year is unusual, because a few updates reach back to columns I wrote long ago. That’s the sweetness of a job like this. People keep in touch to share their good news, and their sorrows, too. </p>
<p>I begin with thanks to you, readers, for stepping up, as you always do in amazing ways. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jessica Rogers</strong>, the gregarious executive director of <a href="https://www.c2iyouth.org/">Connections to Independence </a>(C2i), has received about $23,000 in donations, plus “an awesome volunteer,” and a 2017 15-person van, paid for by a corporate donor. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-who-age-out-of-foster-care-can-still-find-help-with-life-skills/442404273/">Her organization</a> provides stability and independent living skills to youths aging out of foster care.</p>
<p>Low-income women busting through glass ceilings, and <a href="">building entire heating systems</a>, got a massive boost when a donor gave Dunwoody’s <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Women in Technical Careers </strong><a href="http://www.dunwoody.edu/women/">(WITC)</a> a $100,000 infusion in November.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Project Teddy Bear </strong>was inundated with yarn for inmates at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sandstone, Minn. The <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-inmates-crochet-way-to-redemption-in-project-teddy-bear/444518813/">men crochet delightful animals </a>for sick children. Other correctional institutions have expressed interest in the program, launched by University of Minnesota honors students.</p>

<h3>Everyday heroes </h3>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Hanadi Chehabeddine </strong>continues to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rosenblum-muslim-bridge-builder-urges-us-to-fight-fear-ask-questions/364394821/">build bridges as a speaker and diversity trainer </a>on Muslim issues. “Unity comes with understanding and empathy,” said Chehabeddine, who launched her own company, <a href="https://www.hanadispeaksout.com/copy-of-about">Hanadi SBC,</a> this year. “That’s what I try to accomplish by telling my story as a Muslim in America.”</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Peter Izmirian</strong> moved to South Dakota, but the 68-year-old still returns regularly to the Twin Cities to donate platelets. Izmirian told me he <a href="http://www.startribune.com/so-much-taken-from-minnesota-man-yet-still-he-chooses-to-give/407967926/">donates blood </a>because he wants to give back, despite being on a limited income. He donated his 75th gallon with Memorial Blood Centers on Nov. 1.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Joanne Labernik</strong> called with the happy news that seniors distraught over the closing of the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-seniors-who-lost-their-center-make-halloween-call-for-help/453094283/">Skyway Senior Center</a> in March have not one, but two places to call home-away-from-home. Westminster Presbyterian Church and the Downtown Central Library will together operate a senior center every morning, Monday through Thursday, starting in March. Westminster will host in its newly opened wing on Tuesday and Thursday; the library on Monday and Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Pickle maven Doris Rubenstein’s</strong> consciousness-raising effort regarding the Minnesota State Fair Creative Activities food competition continues. “A Pickle,” the play based on her <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local-pickle-maker-gets-rejected-from-minnesota-state-fair-competition-wins-a-play/438154993/">fight for kosher dill justice</a>, will be performed Jan. 22 at the St. Louis Park Sabes Jewish Community Center during its Twin Cities Jewish Humor Fest.</p>
<p>I was disappointed to hear that writer and feminist <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Brenda Ueland’s</strong> home in southwest Minneapolis did not avoid demolition, despite <a href="http://www.startribune.com/there-s-a-big-battle-to-save-author-brenda-ueland-s-little-house-in-linden-hills/414663393/">a robust preservation</a> effort by many. A three-story condo is being considered for the site. Perhaps the developer will at least nod to her literary contributions with a Little Free Library posted outside.</p>
<h3>Burning issues </h3>
<p>As I write this, it does look like <strong style="font-weight: 500;">alimony deductions</strong> will be going away in the massive tax overhaul, but the effective date has been pushed back by a year to Dec. 31, 2018. While there may be some ability to preserve deductibility for pre-existing obligations modified after that date, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-divorce-lawyers-alimony-changes-would-shortchange-families/463937113/">this shortsighted change</a> is likely to create even more fighting by couples facing this difficult passage.</p>
<p>I’m still hearing your opinions on <strong style="font-weight: 500;">whether or not one should take off shoes</strong> when entering another’s home. Thank goodness I found a way to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/must-minnesota-party-guests-toe-the-line-on-requests-to-remove-shoes/464251223/">distract you from politics</a>! Most readers say they do de-shoe because it’s polite; others noted that this is standard in many other countries. But my favorite e-mail came from a reader recalling a party where she cleaned off her shoes, but kept them on, only to be followed around all evening by the host, wiping the floor with a paper towel after every step she took. Needless to say, she’ll be finding other parties.</p>
<h3>Saying goodbye </h3>
<p>We lost some quiet heroes this year. Among them is educator <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Elizabeth G. “Betty” Johnson,</strong> to whom I turned for decades when I wrote about the challenges and joys of raising gifted children. Johnson, who devoted 30 years to the Minnesota Council for the Gifted and Talented, was 86.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Robert B. Dalton</strong>, 94, taught elementary education in Minneapolis for 30 years, officially at least. In truth, he never stopped teaching. I met charming Dalton in 2011 when we featured him and his former student, Ann Hinrichs, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/bob-ann-a-lesson-in-life/115430834/">in “Duets,”</a> a feature celebrating unique friendships. There was nobody like her sixth-grade teacher, Hinrichs said, noting that the two became lifelong friends, meeting regularly for coffee and cream-filled Bismarcks.</p>
<p>“He led me on a path of discovery in that one single year that would forever affect my life.” Dalton helped the shy girl perform in front of a live audience as “Raggedy Rose,” and taught her how to make a box camera, which led to her passion for photography. On her wedding day years later, he pulled from his basement filing cabinet a poem she’d written in his class. “He remembered and treasured his students,” she said. Let’s all remember and treasure the teachers in our lives. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kevin Johnson</strong> was ecstatic to tell me that his two-year campaign to save the Wilderness Discovery Resort for the Disabled paid off for “all our disabled loved ones,” and one person in particular. His buddy, Kirk Williams, a U.S. Navy veteran with multiple sclerosis, accompanied the Johnsons to the 6.8-acre Canadian resort for years before it abruptly shut down. Johnson and his wife, Lorie, created a Facebook campaign, wrote editorials and collected more than 29,000 signatures to get <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rosenblum-advocate-won-t-retreat-in-effort-to-bring-friend-to-outdoors/383984381/">the resort reopened</a>. Johnson felt urgency to do so as Williams’ health declined. But it was Johnson who died suddenly Sept. 29 of a major stroke. He was 59. Williams moved to a foster home run by veterans. And a “Kevin’s Road to Paradise” ramp will be installed at the resort. Heartbroken Lorie calls it “a beautiful ending.”</p>
<h3>Simply grateful </h3>
<p>I’m going to leave you with <strong style="font-weight: 500;">leftovers</strong>. After I shared my concern with <a href="http://www.startribune.com/let-s-learn-to-love-leftovers-and-fight-food-waste/459403753/">how wasteful we’ve become with food</a>, a reader sent me this meaningful food for thought. “When I buy food over the counter,” he wrote (requesting anonymity), “I say thank you to the vendor because I know how wonderful it is that I live and buy in a country where food is plentiful and affordable and tasteful and healthy and politely served to me by someone working at little more than minimum wage. I also thank the person who sells me affordable clothes that look good, drugs that are pure and that work, a car we use all the time, and a house of worship in which I am welcome.”</p>
<p>I can’t top that, so I’ll just say thank you for your immeasurable generosity to others in our community. Thanks, too, for reading the Star Tribune (in any form you choose) and for writing to me. A healthy, happy and safe New Year to all. </p>

<p>Brinks wasn&#8217;t eating. Although green beans are among his favorite foods, he turned his nose up at two bowls of them placed around the Minnetonka house where the yellow Lab lives. </p>
<p>To help, canine massage therapist Heidi Hesse rubbed Brinks in a specific spot on his ankle, an acupressure point, to soothe his lower back, bladder and kidneys. After an hour of massage with Hesse, Brinks regained his appetite and chowed down on a bowl of the veggies. </p>
<p>Massage is just one of a growing body of alternative therapies that Mary Kelley and Mark Falstad, Brinks&#8217; humans, employ to ease the 10-year-old dog&#8217;s stiff joints, jump-start his appetite and soothe his ailing liver. Acupuncture is another. </p>
<p>As people increasingly take a holistic approach to their health, they&#8217;re also looking to alternatives to conventional medical care for their nonhuman family members. That&#8217;s why a new breed of wellness services for dogs — from chiropractic and aromatherapy to Chinese herbs and psychic communication — is springing up in the Twin Cities. </p>
<p>&#8220;It stems from human stuff,&#8221; said Dr. Cathy Sinning of <a href="http://lakeharrietvet.com/">Lake Harriet Veterinary (­lakeharrietvet.com)</a>. &#8220;There&#8217;s more mainstreaming now because of people learning how it can help themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost a third of Americans seek out &#8220;complementary and alternative medicine&#8221; to enhance their medical care, according to studies by the Centers for Disease Control. That includes using natural products, such as fish oil to combat heart disease; engaging in mind and body practices, such as meditation and yoga; or other approaches such as herbal remedies, traditional Chinese medicine or homeopathic drugs. </p>

<p>More humans, it seems, want their pets to have the same options. </p>
<p>When Sinning and her husband, Jim, began practicing in south Minneapolis 20 years ago, they were among the few veterinarians in the area integrating chiropractic and herbal medicine into standard care. These days, Sinning said, &#8220;most clinics have someone on staff doing acupuncture.&#8221; </p>
<p>Courses for veterinarians to learn additional &#8220;modalities&#8221; have been booming over the past 15 years, said Dr. Barbara Hodges, a holistic veterinarian and veterinary adviser for the California-based Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association. </p>
<h3>Adding to, not replacing </h3>
<p>Hodges doesn&#8217;t view the interest in alternative therapies as a rejection of traditional veterinarian medicine, just a complement to it. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simply enlarging your horizons and the array of things you can offer to your patients,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>For example, a drug that can help a dog with an ailment might also cause serious side effects. So some vets might recommend an herbal remedy or a diet-and-exercise plan to mitigate those effects. </p>
<p>Practitioners say alternative treatments can improve circulation or digestion, ease muscle and joint pain, help animals recover from injury or surgery and calm a host of behavioral issues. </p>
<p><a href="http://amywilliamsdelong.com/">Amy Williams DeLong</a>, a certified aromatherapist who specializes in working with animals, says aromatherapy can provide all of those benefits. Oils of herbs and roots that are known to ease pain travel by scent, and in a dog &#8220;are absorbed into the brain and bloodstream in less than a second,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>At a recent appointment in Shoreview, DeLong let 8½-year-old German shepherd Izzy sniff a canvas tote filled with small bottles of essential oils. Izzy seemed to choose cinnamon and ginger by repeatedly licking the caps of the bottles. DeLong said those scents indicated that Izzy wanted a &#8220;warming&#8221; fragrance to help with circulation. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to make you a holiday blend,&#8221; she told Izzy. </p>
<p>Izzy&#8217;s human, Julie Northenscold, was looking for something to alleviate her dog&#8217;s arthritis. </p>
<p>On DeLong&#8217;s instructions, Northenscold sprays a custom scent in her home or rubs it into her hands and then onto Izzy&#8217;s coat. Northenscold said that the scents have proved more effective than other medicines. The scents also help Izzy, who is deaf, find her owner. An initial aromatherapy session with DeLong (amywilliamsdelong.com) costs $65. </p>
<p>Training and certification for holistic pet practitioners vary widely. Some are veterinarians, such as animal acupuncturists, who are required in Minnesota to have a veterinary degree. Pet massage therapists don&#8217;t need any certification in Minnesota. But Hesse, Brinks&#8217; massage therapist, trained at the Chicago School of Canine Massage. Her work requires a deep understanding of dog anatomy, she said. An initial consultation with her <a href="http://soundhoundmassage.com/">Sound Hound Canine Massage (soundhoundmassage.com)</a> runs $80.</p>
<p>Still, most practitioners caution pet owners to work with trained professionals and not to try DIY remedies found on the internet. </p>
<h3>&#8216;Out there&#8217; remedies </h3>
<p>In addition to more familiar treatments, there are other, less common pet care methods available. </p>
<p>Elaine Garley is a holistic practitioner who communicates telepathically with animals. Clients send her a photo of their pet along with questions they want her to ask (packages start at $39 for three questions). Garley then writes back with a &#8220;transcript&#8221; of the conversation. </p>
<p>&#8220;I get a running conversation in my head just like we&#8217;re talking on the phone,&#8221; said Garley, whose Minneapolis company is called <a href="http://animalbridges.com">Animal Bridges (animalbridges.com)</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, a client with a cat who was howling hired Garley. &#8220;As soon as I connected with the cat, I had a sinus headache,&#8221; indicating that was what was ailing the cat, Garley said. </p>
<p>Hesse, the massage therapist, hired Garley to &#8220;speak&#8221; to her sheepdog before it died, and then again afterward. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little out there, even for me, but it was still comforting to hear what Lulu said,&#8221; Hesse said, tearfully. &#8220;I think there is something to it.&#8221; </p>
<p>With <a href="http://lenaswanson.com/">Lena Swanson</a>, another local animal communicator, people describe their pets during a phone call and explain their concerns. Swanson then places them on hold while she communicates telepathically with the animal. She charges $2.75 per minute for her services. (<a href="http://">lenaswanson.com</a>)</p>
<p>Clients come to her to understand why a cat stopped using its litter box, or ask a sick pet if it&#8217;s time to let go. </p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds so outlandish,&#8221; Swanson said, but she said she believes that animal communication is an important skill many people can learn to tap into. Next month, she is <a href="http://lenaswanson.com/2018-01-27-plan-ahead-animal-communication-weekend">teaching a course</a> for anyone interested in trying it themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people don&#8217;t hear words; they just get a gut sense of knowing what animals say,&#8221; Swanson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the hardest thing to trust.&#8221; </p>
<h3>&#8216;Part of our family&#8217; </h3>
<p>Not all pets come to holistic care through their humans; sometimes it works the other way. </p>
<p>After seeing the reviving effects of acupuncture and massage on Brinks, Kelley and Falstad are considering trying it themselves. Kelley has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair to get around. (Brinks is her service dog.) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, they&#8217;ll continue to give their pets every option they can to live comfortably, from mainstream veterinary medicine to the hands-on healing that practitioners such as Hesse offer. </p>
<p>&#8220;People might think this is frivolous, but they&#8217;re a part of our family,&#8221; Kelley said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve given us so much. We can give something back.&#8221; </p>

                                    </div>
<p>If anyone can restore proper awe to the notion of space travel, Buzz Aldrin can. At 87, Aldrin, who made history in 1969 when he set foot on the moon, has hung onto his plain-as-folk charm and easy, infectious enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Those attractions may well factor into pop culture’s resurrected romance with the pioneering astronaut, who raised his profile in recent years with guest spots on shows including “The Simpsons” and “Dancing With the Stars,” and an appearance at the Summer Olympics in Rio last year. In November, Aldrin led the annual Veterans Day parade in New York City, serving as grand marshal. </p>
<p>Unstoppable, it seems, he recently embarked on yet another life chapter: Last winter, he strode the runway of menswear designer Nick Graham, showing off a silver foil jacket with distinctly aerodynamic loft. So it may have been only a matter of time before Aldrin made the leap to a mainstream brand. </p>
<p>This fall, Sprayground, a youth-oriented streetwear label, enlisted this all-American hero to give a shout-out to its wares. And, improbable though it may seem, Aldrin, an outspoken proponent of travel to Mars, attached his name, and his myth, to a “Mission to Mars” fashion capsule collection of coats, duffels, backpacks and the rugged like. </p>
<p>“Buzz was the man who gave us a taste of space in the ’60s,” said David Ben-David, Sprayground’s founder and chief executive. “We thought it would be cool to see where his head’s at now.” </p>
<p>Aldrin, a space evangelist preaching the gospel of interplanetary travel through his Space Share Foundation, said he had little practical input into the products’ design. Their value, he maintained, is less in pushing the wares than in promoting a vision. </p>
<p>“The idea of flying around in space, even though it seems a little far out, certainly catches young people’s attention,” he said in a phone interview. “Especially when you jazz it up by carrying a briefcase that lights up in your hands.” </p>
<p>This quirky rag-trade partnership resonates for sure in the popular culture, which is celebrating its own astral moment. The notion of space travel appears to be exerting a new hold on people’s imaginations, seducing with the promise of a fresh start on unsullied terrain. </p>
<p>“Everything streams from the zeitgeist,” said Daniel H. Wilson, a robotics engineer and author of science fiction novels such as “A Clockwork Dynasty” and “Robogenesis.” In the world of sci-fi publishing, he said, there has been tendency to forsake gloom-and-doom scenarios in favor of more exhilaratingly upbeat fare. The objective, it seems, is to revive the optimism of the late 1960s, when the promise of adventure and discovery — and the reality of a lunar landing — spawned a generalized blue-sky optimism. </p>
<p>That mood contrasts mightily with the one of the moment. In a currently divisive, often chaotic sociopolitical climate, “space exploration offers a vision of escape that’s really appealing,” Wilson said. “If reality is dystopia, why shouldn’t our dreams turn utopic?” </p>
<p>Fashion is celebrating its own return to the galaxies. Past expeditions included those of Karl Lagerfeld, Rick Owens and Christophe Decarnin of Balmain, who nearly a decade ago cast a wistful backward glance at the swashbuckling universe of space-traveling superheroes, a universe earlier explored by André Courrèges, Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin. </p>
<p>Somehow their vision persists. This year, Alessandro Michele of Gucci introduced fall advertising images of UFOs and beam-me-up-Scotty teleportation platforms. Lagerfeld, in his fall show, offered the spectacle of a simulated rocket launch to highlight a collection of sparkle tights, dresses and cap-toe boots, and a silver Mylar space blanket. Last spring, Stuart Vevers of Coach, no laggard in this latest fashion space race, unveiled a retro-futuristic capsule collection of NASA-themed handbags, light jackets and sweatshirts. “The collection is very nostalgic,” Vevers said at the time. “There’s something about the time of the space program that just gives this feeling of possibility.” His cosmic references, he said, “are symbolic of a moment of ultimate American optimism and togetherness.” </p>
<p>But the appeal of the cosmos isn’t all nostalgia — at least if you believe the battery of entrepreneurs intent on boldly going where few have gone before. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, who aims to ship colonists to Mars in a decade, said he plans to send two tourists on a flight around the moon as early as next year. </p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has reached deep into his pockets to finance his rocket company, Blue Origin. And Robert D. Richards, chief executive of Moon Express, has conceived a business plan intended, he said, “to expand Earth’s economic sphere to the moon and beyond.” </p>
<p>Aldrin, who predicts settlements on Mars by 2040, has loftier aims, some founded on his indelible recollections. “You’ll always remember the times when you launch and when you’re in a coasting condition — zero gravity,” he said. “There is the view of other spacecraft that you’re close to, and, of course, the landing, touching down on soil that in hundreds of thousands of years has been ground to a little fine dust. </p>
<p>“You can’t find anything like that here on Earth. It is exciting to see something that is so absolutely un-reproducible.” </p>
<p>He hopes to inspire a youthful generation, “obsessed,” in his phrase, with “the short-term payoff,” to participate in a larger, more ennobling scheme. While not technically suited for space exploration, his backpacks and solar-panel flight jackets serve metaphorical function, he said, to remind wearers that they are but fragments in a whole, “members of a team, part of something bigger than themselves.” </p>
<p>Ben-David of Sprayground wants to share in that dream. But for now, he said: “My goal is to make the ultimate backpack. And the ultimate backpack is a jet pack.” </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Andrew Krammer</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/19083210/AX050_78B6_9.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-13117" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/19083210/AX050_78B6_9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer is again considering handing off defensive play calling to coordinator George Edwards, however only after this season ends. </p>
<p>Zimmer considered the switch last offseason, saying he was evaluating ways he could be a better head coach on game days. </p>
<p>“[Edwards] really does everything for me, other than I call the plays on Sunday,” Zimmer said during a conference call with Chicago reporters on Wednesday. “But I may change that next year.” </p>
<p>The NFL’s Career Development Advisory Panel recently distributed its list of annual head-coaching candidates, which reportedly included both Vikings coordinators Edwards and Pat Shurmur. </p>
<p>“George does everything,” Zimmer said. “He helps with the game plan. He runs a lot of the meetings, the defensive meetings. Him and I really sit down and talk about all the different things that are going on. He studies the game just like he’s calling the game. So he’ll come in and talk to me about second down-and-whatever. ‘They’re doing this,’ or, ‘they’re doing that.’ Really, he does everything other than call the game on Sunday.” </p>
<p>Edwards last called defensive plays full-time in 2011 for the Bills. He stepped in for Zimmer and called defensive plays during the Vikings’ 17-15 loss to the Cowboys last season, when the defense played well. </p>
<p>This is Zimmer’s 18th NFL season calling plays, which he’s alluded to as one of his strengths. The numbers prove it. </p>
<p>The Vikings are the NFL’s No. 1 scoring defense entering the final regular season game. Minnesota has ranked no worse than 11th since hiring Zimmer. </p>
<p>“You know, I don’t know,” Zimmer said when asked why he’d delegate play calling. “It’s a lot of work when you sit down and do it. I’ve done it for a long time. And because I have confidence in George, as well. I think maybe just the fact that, um, you know, I don’t know – I guess I’m just getting older.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>For Eric Fischer, not knowing hurts the most. </p>
<p>Since his son was critically wounded in a police shooting at Minneapolis City Hall last week, Fischer says he’s been allowed little contact with Marcus Fischer, 18, who is still recovering from self-inflicted stab wounds and police bullets. </p>
<p>Hospital officials have not disclosed details about his son’s condition, he said. What little information he’s been able to pry out of authorities has left him feeling empty. He learned from a psychiatrist who interviewed Marcus that he was up and walking around. He said he could only wonder what must have been going through Marcus’ mind. Police say the younger Fischer brought a knife into an interview room and stabbed himself repeatedly, after being left unattended. </p>
<p>“I didn’t raise my son to be like this, so I don’t really have a comment on what his mental state was,” he said. </p>
<p>Eric Fischer brought his pain to court on Friday and Tuesday to watch what should have been Marcus’ first appearance on charges that he robbed and shot a man during a gun deal gone awry in northeast Minneapolis earlier this year. But both times the hearing was pushed back a day, because he wasn’t yet well enough to leave the hospital. No one told Fischer. On Wednesday, Hennepin County prosecutors announced that Marcus Fischer’s court date was again rescheduled to Jan. 3. </p>
<p>Eric Fischer said he did not learn of the shooting until late Monday morning when his daughter called him at work, after seeing a post about Marcus on social media. </p>

<p>On his first visit to Marcus’ room at Hennepin County Medical Center last Saturday, Eric said he was kept from approaching Marcus’ bed by a sheriff’s deputy who stayed in the room the whole time. Another three deputies were stationed outside the door, he said. </p>
<p>“They wanted to make sure I didn’t share any information about the case; they wanted to make sure I didn’t touch my son,” Eric Fischer said. “I just wanted to give him a hug and kiss on the forehead, to make sure he knows that I’m here for him.” </p>
<p>His son had just emerged from surgery to repair a deep gash to his throat, Eric Fischer said, and wasn’t able to speak. Fischer said he can now see his son during regular inmate visiting hours on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. </p>
<p>The sheriff’s office said it is following procedure with limited visits. </p>
<p>“If somebody’s in our custody and they are being treated at HCMC, our policy doesn’t allow for visitors except for under special circumstances,” said spokesman Jon Collins. But, he said, exceptions are made occasionally, “if we believe that it’s in the best interests of the inmate’s health and wellness.” </p>
<p>“These policies are in place for both inmates’ safety and security, as well as the safety and security of our deputies, as well as the general public,” Collins said. </p>
<p>The hospital has stated that per policy it can’t release information about a patient in police custody. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Eric Fischer and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/after-outcry-relatives-of-man-shot-by-minneapolis-police-demand-visitation/466687053/">a group of supporters marched</a>, first to County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office and then the Sheriff’s Office headquarters at City Hall, to demand that the family be allowed to visit Marcus without supervision in the hospital. A supporter has started an online fundraiser for Marcus Fischer’s hospital expenses at <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/marcus-fischer-medical-fund">gofundme.com/marcus-fischer-medical-fund</a>.</p>
<p>Mary Moriarty, the county’s chief public defender, said that her office had been assigned to Marcus’ criminal case — in which he faces charges of first-degree assault, first-degree robbery and possession of a handgun by a prohibited person. </p>
<p>She clarified that a public defender would be representing Marcus only in his criminal case, and not in any civil action that springs from the City Hall shooting. </p>
<p>After his arrest Dec. 18 on suspicion of involvement with a robbery and shooting, Fischer was brought to police headquarters for questioning. </p>
<p>At one point, he was left unattended in an interview room when the case detectives got up to get him some water. When they returned, sources say Fischer was cutting himself with a large folding knife that he brought into the room in his waistband and tried to slash his own throat. Officers tried to negotiate with Marcus, unsuccessfully using a Taser to subdue him, the sources said, then opened fire when he ignored orders to put the weapon down and started moving toward the door. </p>
<p>The two officers who fired their guns — Sgt. Gene Suker and officer Jerome Carey — <a href="http://www.startribune.com/robbery-suspect-shot-by-minneapolis-police-to-make-first-court-appearance/465942403/">are on routine paid leave</a> pending the outcome of a state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into the incident. So is officer David Martinson, who deployed the Taser. Officials said that metal-detecting wands will now be placed in every interview room at headquarters and at each of the five police precincts.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>A Roman Catholic priest on leave from two northwestern Minnesota parishes for 20 months amid an allegation of sexual misconduct with a 15-year-old boy returned to public ministry in time to celebrate Christmas. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.crookston.org/offices/bishop/from-the-bishop/741-december-23-2017-statement-of-the-diocese-of-crookston-re-reinstatement-of-fr-pat-sullivan">statement</a> posted on the Diocese of Crookston website Saturday, Bishop Michael Hoeppner said its clergy abuse review panel scrutinized a deposition given by the accuser in a lawsuit “and deemed the allegations not credible.”</p>
<p>The diocese statement also pointed out that local and federal authorities investigated the allegations and that “no criminal charges were filed.” No other accusations have been leveled against the Rev. Patrick Sullivan, who has denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Sullivan returned to his work at the same parishes where he had been before, St. Elizabeth’s in Dilworth and St. Andrew’s in Hawley, said the Rev. Mike Foltz of the Crookston diocese. </p>
<p>“He was there for Christmas,” Foltz said. “The people were ecstatic, from the children to the parents to the grandparents. They swarmed him with love and affection and hugs.” </p>
<p>His accuser, now an adult, said that the sexual misconduct occurred more than eight years ago, when Sullivan was pastor at St. Mary’s Mission Church in Red Lake. </p>
<p>The diocese panel, called the Board of Review for the Protection of Children and Young People, is composed of two social workers, a county sheriff, a police detective, an attorney and a diocesan priest. </p>
<p>The board’s ruling was unanimous, Foltz said. </p>
<p>Foltz declined to reveal the identities of the board members, saying that he didn’t want them “to get calls from the media.” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.andersonadvocates.com/Posts/News-or-Event/2196/News-Release-Diocese-of-Crookston-Wrongly-Reinstates-Priest-Accused-of-Child-Sexual-Abuse.aspx">Jeff Anderson</a>, the St. Paul attorney representing the plaintiff, said Wednesday that Sullivan’s reinstatement is a “reckless” act that “poses a threat of harm to children.”</p>
<p>Anderson, who has represented many victims of clergy abuse in legal actions from the parish level all the way to the Vatican, said, “There is information that has not been made known to the public that is in Bishop Hoeppner’s possession that demonstrates that this diocese and Hoeppner are doing the wrong thing again.” </p>
<p>Anderson cautioned that the suit, filed on behalf of Doe 457, remains active and the plaintiff and the defendant continue to exchange information about the case. </p>
<p>The attorney went on to say that his firm has received information that Hoeppner received notice that Sullivan “posed a serious risk of harm” before Doe 457 came forth with his allegations. </p>
<p>Foltz said the diocese is unaware of any other troubling information concerning Sullivan, “otherwise, we wouldn’t put him back in the ministry.” </p>
<p>The diocese statement concluded by stating that it “takes any and all accusations of sexual misconduct by clergy very seriously.” </p>
<p>It then urged that anyone with knowledge of sexual misconduct involving the Diocese of Crookston to contact its victim’s assistance coordinator at 218-281-7895. </p>
<p>Since 2014, Crookston has released the names of six other priests credibly accused of sexually molesting minors. The diocese has also acknowledged similar allegations against a now-retired priest, Roger Grundhaus. </p>
<p>More than 500 claims of sex abuse by Minnesota clergy have been made in the past four years, most through a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/more-than-800-sex-abuse-claims-filed-under-minnesota-law/380524441/">law</a> that allowed older civil cases to be filed over a three-year period that ended in 2016.</p>
<p>Catholic leaders have said that the abuse scandal is in the past, and that reforms have been made. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Neal St. Anthony</h4>
<p>Chuck &amp; Don’s, the pet-supplies store, is adding a 40th store in January, at 50th and France Avenue in Edina. <br> Chuck &amp; Don’s will open a small shop of 2,300 square feet, which includes a pet-grooming studio, its third. <br> The store also will sell a limited selection of pet food and other products.<br> “We’re thrilled to join the [Edina] business community in 2018,” said CEO Bob Hartzell. “We jumped at the opportunity to lease the available space for our 29th retail location [in Minnesota] and are excited to expand by welcoming the [Edina-store] grooming duo to the Chuck &amp; Don’s team.”<br> Chuck &amp; Don’s operates 10 locations in Colorado, 28 stores in Minnesota and one in Wisconsin. <br> Chief Financial Officer Thomas Murphy said Chuck &amp; Don’s opened four Minnesota stores this year and that the company expects revenue this year to grow to “in excess of $70 Million.”<br> Hartzell, 64, and co-owner Chuck Anderson, 76, of the 27-year-old company, are in the fourth year of selling their ownership to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.<br> It is funded gradually, out of the employee portion of pretax profits.<br> “ESOP” proponents say that they are a great way for employees to gain ownership and wealth from a growing business. That is if the owners are willing to “get rich slowly,” through a staged, conservative buyout. Hartzell said this fall that he and Anderson chose the ESOP route over higher cash-out transactions to a competitor or financial buyer, such as a private equity shop.</p>

<p>Airplane food tends to be more of a punchline than a pleasure. And yet, at 35,000 feet, even a forlorn-looking tray can serve as both entertainment and sustenance for a captive audience. With that in mind, Charles Platkin, director of the New York City Food Policy Center at Hunter College, sought to uncover just how healthy or unhealthy airplane food is, and the results are published in the Annual Airline Food Investigation, a survey he’s conducted since 2000 (it became annual in 2009). </p>
<p>For the survey, Platkin reached out to representatives with 12 major airlines to inquire about their meal and snack options. He ranks them based, in part, on calories, nutrition, menu innovation and transparency (some airlines are more candid than others about what’s in their food). </p>
<p>“They call me an airline food bully,” says Platkin, who is also founder of the site DietDetective.com. “I’m aggressive about it. People have choices about what airline they fly, but they don’t have choices about what they eat on that flight,” he says. </p>
<p>Each airline is given a “health score” on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest. This year, Delta and Virgin America tied for the lead, with each scoring 4 points, and Air Canada tied for second with JetBlue. Hawaiian Airlines came in last. </p>
<p>It’s telling that no airline scored the highest rating of 5. “The airlines still have a tremendous amount of room for improvement,” says Platkin. “No airline blows me away, like, ‘Oh my gosh, they got it.’ ” To that end, he was more inclined to use phrases such as “not awful” when describing a meal or snack, rather than showering it with praise. While a handful of those surveyed serve complimentary meals on select flights (Delta, American and Hawaiian), Platkin is more inclined to encourage health-conscious passengers to eat a full meal before they fly and to carry their own snacks (nuts, fruit, vegetables, hummus) onboard. </p>
<p>Here’s how the 12 airlines scored, along with some of the “Best bets” to munch on from each. ( <a href="http://www.dietdetective.com/annual-airline-food-investigation-2017-18/">Click here</a> for the full survey and more “best bets” and nutritional info.)</p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Delta</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Excellent </p>
<p>Health score: 4 stars </p>
<p>Average calories overall (meals, snack boxes and individual snacks): 480 </p>
<p>Delta was notable for its willingness to share nutritional information, its variety of offerings and the fact that the average calories in the snack boxes, meals and individual snacks decreased from 2016’s 527 to 480, and meal calories decreasing from 628 calories to 559. Delta has also begun offering complimentary meals in economy class on select flights. </p>
<p>Best bets: For a snack, opt for the almonds (124 calories); the vegan, GMO-free Delta Flight Fuel Tapas Snack Box (it should be eaten as a meal, not a snack, because of the higher calories, says Platkin), which has Super Seed Crackers, Snapea Crisps, almonds, hummus, quinoa with pepper dip and other items (665 calories); the fruit-and-yogurt continental breakfast (345 calories if you save the Kind bar for later); the sesame noodle salad (345 calories); or the Greek mezze plate (330 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Virgin America</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Excellent </p>
<p>Health score: 4 stars </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 340 </p>
<p>Platkin says that healthier options and openness about calories and nutrients have all been a part of Virgin’s approach since the airline launched (although it has since been purchased by Alaska Airlines). </p>
<p>Best bets: Go with the nuts as a snack (Creative Snack Brain Smart Nut Mix, 510 calories, and Hail Merry Seasoned Nut Blend, 220 calories) and share them or save part for later; opt for one of the meals, such as the 420-calorie, vegetarian protein-packed quinoa wrap; the 440-calorie protein plate with a cage-free hard-boiled egg, cheese, grilled chicken breast, fresh vegetables, wheat pita rounds and edamame hummus; or the 390-calorie farro salad. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Air Canada</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 3.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 320 </p>
<p>Best bets: Skotidakis fat-free vanilla Greek yogurt (90 calories); Avocado Smash Box with fresh guacamole, aged cheddar cheese, hard-boiled egg, green apple slices, multigrain muesli bread, chili flakes (590 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">JetBlue Airways</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Somewhat helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 3.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 337 </p>
<p>Best bets: Platkin highlights the Amp Up Box, with hummus, a fruit bar, olives, crackers, almonds and other items (425 calories) for its nutritional value, but acknowledges the calories are high. Other good choices on select flights: yogurt and granola (210 calories), kale and quinoa salad (320 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Alaska Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Extremely helpful </p>
<p>Health score 3.5 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 479.6 </p>
<p>Best bet: Platkin suggests sharing the Mediterranean Tapas Picnic Pack (vegan, kosher and gluten-free) or having it as a meal, because it’s 510 calories. It comes with multigrain snack chips, olives, hummus, almonds and more. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">United</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Somewhat helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 2.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 416 </p>
<p>Best bet: For a snack, go for the hummus (160 calories) or the Tapas Snack Box, which comes with a variety of items including flatbread, crackers, bruschetta, hummus, almonds, mints and more (avoid the cheese spread, says Platkin). The Mezze Sampler (501 calories), is another good option. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">American Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Below average </p>
<p>Health score: 2.5 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 446 </p>
<p>Best bets: Go for the hummus box as a snack (220 calories) or the Chicken Arugula Wrap (when available) for lunch and go easy on the dressing (401 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Frontier Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health Rating: 2.25 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 372 </p>
<p>Best bet: Snack options are fairly limited. Go for the Colorado Nut Co. Trail mix (393 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Southwest Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health Score: 2 </p>
<p>Average calories: 125 </p>
<p>Best Bet: Southwest offers a fairly limited selection, but the ones it does offer are complimentary. Peanuts (70 calories) are the best bet, says Platkin, even though the pretzels have lower calories. </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Allegiant Air</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Very helpful </p>
<p>Health Score: 1.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 402 </p>
<p>Best bets: The Nut Medley (680 calories) if shared with another person or portioned out; hummus and pita chips (150 calories). Platkin warns people away from the Wingz Kids Snack Pack (Oreos, baked Goldfish and Welch’s fruit snacks, 240 calories) and the Deli Snack Pack (Wheat Thins, cheese spread, almonds, Biscoff cookies, Slim Jim, 530 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Spirit Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Helpful </p>
<p>Health score: 1.75 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 316 </p>
<p>Best bet: Hummus with pita chips (220 calories). </p>
<h3><strong><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Hawaiian Airlines</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Cooperation in providing nutritional information: Terrible/unresponsive </p>
<p>Health score: 1 </p>
<p>Average calories overall: 568 </p>
<p>Platkin says that the airline representatives didn’t share nutritional information, so he and his team had to estimate in their findings. Hawaiian Airlines offers free meals, and the high calorie counts associated with them, which he found averaged 971 calories, worked against them in Platkin’s ratings. </p>
<p>Best bets: Hummus and pita chips (197 calories). Although Platkin writes in his report: “In the end, it would be best to eat before you board the plane; otherwise you might wind up feeling lethargic and cranky after one of these calorie-heavy meals. Just say no, and bring your own food.” </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">The income limits will change by about 2 percent based on inflation.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Nicole Norfleet</h4>
<p>The Minnesota Department of Revenue has shifted the state’s individual income tax brackets for next year based on inflation. </p>
<p>For the 2018 tax year, the state’s tax brackets will change about 2 percent from tax-year 2017, the department said on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The adjustment does not change the Minnesota tax rate that applies to each income bracket. Since 1979, there has been an annual adjustment of the brackets to take inflation into account. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><style type="text/css">.embed iframe{height:345px;} @media only screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 767px){.embed iframe {height:450px;}}</style></p>
<div><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="345" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1PcJF/1/" width="100%"></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>For example, for a single person, the income limit grew $500 to $25,890 to qualify for the lowest tax rate of 5.35 percent. The taxable income that pushes a single person into the top bracket, with a rate of 9.85 percent, increased $3,120 to $160,020. </p>
<p>Taxpayers who make quarterly payments on estimated taxes should use the new rate schedule to figure out payments, which are due starting next April. </p>
<p>Under new federal tax law, both brackets and rates have changed. The Internal Revenue Service is likely to publish the schedule in February. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">It is at least the third time a local worker has been accused since 2013.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Brandon Stahl</h4>
<p>An employee at the Eden Prairie Massage Envy faces two counts of third-degree sexual assault after being accused of molesting his clients while giving them massages. </p>
<p>Mitchell Le Dac Ho, 28, of Eden Prairie, is at least the third Massage Envy employee in the metro area <a href="http://www.startribune.com/edina-masseuse-charged-with-sex-assault/452565203/">to be charged with sexually assaulting a client</a> since 2013.</p>
<p>One of Ho&#8217;s clients told Eden Prairie police in March 2016 that he digitally penetrated her during a massage until she told him to stop, according to the criminal complaint. She paid for the session and left. She told police she was too afraid to tell anyone about what happened. As officers continued to investigate they lost contact with the woman, according to the charge, until they were able to find her again. </p>
<p>Ho was still working at the Eden Prairie franchise in September 2017 when he digitally penetrated a juvenile girl for five to 10 minutes, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>A district manager for the Eden Prairie Massage Envy referred questions to the company&#8217;s media relations department, which has not immediately responded for comment. </p>
<p>At least five Massage Envy clients have accused their massage therapists of assault in the last four years. John Earl Young II, 29, was charged in 2013 with molesting a client at a Minnetonka franchise in June that year. </p>
<p>The next month he was working at a Bloomington store when he sexually assaulted another client. He was convicted in both cases in 2015 and sentenced to half a year in jail. </p>
<p>In October, Matthew Ryan Perry, 41, of Hopkins, was charged with criminal sexual conduct after a client at the Edina store accused him of touching her vagina during a massage. His case is still pending. </p>
<p>Massage Envy has more than 1,000 franchises in the country, including 22 in the Twin Cities metro area, according to the company&#8217;s website. In a statement, the company said they are cooperating with law enforcement, and that Ho is no longer with the franchise. </p>
<p><span class="dateline">&#8220;Safety in the treatment room is </span>– and always will be – our priority, and we believe our recently announced Commitment to Safety defines a clear path forward that will create meaningful change to ensure the safety and well-being of members and guests,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

                                    </div>
<p>President Donald Trump’s legal team plans to cast former national security adviser Michael Flynn as a liar seeking to protect himself if he accuses the president or his senior aides of any wrongdoing, according to three people familiar with the strategy. </p>
<p>The approach would mark a sharp break from Trump’s previously sympathetic posture toward Flynn, whom he called a “wonderful man” when Flynn departed the White House in February. Earlier this month, the president did not rule out a possible pardon for Flynn, who is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. </p>
<p>Attorneys for Trump and his top advisers have privately expressed confidence that Flynn does not have any evidence that could implicate the president or his White House team. But since Flynn’s cooperation agreement with prosecutors was made public earlier this month, the administration has been strategizing how to neutralize him in case the former national security adviser does make any claims. </p>
<p>Flynn is the most senior former Trump adviser known to be providing information to Mueller’s team. The lenient terms of his plea agreement suggest he has promised significant information to investigators, legal experts said. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of lying to the FBI, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Prosecutors said they will recommend a sentence from zero to six months in prison as part of his cooperation deal. Flynn’s son, who served as his chief of staff, also faced the risk of criminal charges, according to people familiar with the plea negotiations, but was spared. </p>
<p>Trump’s legal team has seized on Flynn’s agreement with prosecutors as fodder for a possible defense, if necessary. In court filings, the retired lieutenant general admitted that he lied to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the December 2016 transition. </p>
<p>“He’s said it himself: He’s a liar,” said one person helping craft the strategy who was granted anonymity to describe private conversations. </p>
<p>Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, declined to comment. Ty Cobb, the White House attorney overseeing the response to the special counsel investigation, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Defense lawyers have said privately that Flynn will be unable to point to White House or campaign records turned over in the probe to bolster any claims of a criminal scheme. None of those records suggest a conspiracy by Trump or his inner circle to improperly work with Russians to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, according to people who have reviewed the documents. </p>
<p>The private talks about assailing Flynn’s credibility come even as Trump has signaled that a pardon is not off the table. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet,” the president said Dec. 15. “We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.” </p>
<p>Some of Flynn’s family members appear to be counting on Trump to act. On Tuesday, one of Flynn’s brothers tweeted a message urging the president to pardon his former adviser, responding to a tweet by Trump alleging bias in the FBI. </p>
<p>“Mr. President, I personally believe that a pardon is due to General Flynn, given the apparent and obvious illegitimacy of the manner in which the so called ‘crimes’ he plead guilty to were extracted from him,” Joseph Flynn wrote. “I ask for quick action on this. Thank you and keep up the good work!” </p>
<p>Joseph Flynn did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Outside legal experts said that discussing ways to undermine a possible witness is a natural first step for defense lawyers to consider. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty predictable,” said Randall Eliason, a former public corruption prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington. “Defense will always argue that a cooperator who lied previously should not be believed, and that there is insufficient evidence of the conspiracy. It’s Defense Strategy 101.” </p>
<p>He added: “How effective it would be depends entirely on the strength of the other evidence that the prosecution can present to prove its case and corroborate Flynn.” </p>
<p>Barbara Van Gelder, a veteran white-collar defense lawyer and former prosecutor, called it “textbook” for the defense team to raise doubts about Flynn’s version of events. </p>
<p>“They will pull out all the arguments: ‘You pleaded guilty. You don’t have anything more than your word, and you probably got your son off with this. You got the deal of the century,’ “ she said. </p>
<p>Securing documents that corroborate the statements of cooperators such as Flynn is often key when the case comes down to dueling accounts, legal experts said. </p>
<p>“People’s recollections can be faulty but … you can’t cross-examine a document,” Van Gelder said. “It is what it is.” </p>
<p>Exactly what Flynn might offer Mueller about what he saw inside the Trump operation remains a mystery. Van Gelder noted that in the way the special counsel structured Flynn’s plea agreement, prosecutors avoided sharing the guts of their ongoing investigation. </p>
<p>“That is what I thought was the brilliance of the Flynn plea,” she said. “It said: ‘I’m giving just enough to have the judge sentence you within the guidelines, but not giving anything to anybody else.’ “ </p>
<p>White House advisers have noted Flynn did not plead guilty to being a co-conspirator in any criminal scheme, which they argue shows he is not able to provide evidence of a larger conspiracy. </p>
<p>Some legal experts said prosecutors could still rely on Flynn’s testimony to allege such a scheme. However, others said persuading a jury to charge a conspiracy that did not include a key witness would be more difficult. </p>
<p>If Mueller opted not to charge him in a conspiracy, Van Gelder asked, “how much of a crime is it, really?” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Regions Hospital is seeking state approval for an expansion that officials say is needed to serve an aging population in a facility that is already near capacity. </p>
<p>By 2040, the large medical center in St. Paul said it wants to add 100 beds and the equivalent of 950 full-time workers, according to a filing this month with state regulators. The figures represent increases of more than 20 percent in the current bed and employee counts. </p>
<p>Ultimately, approval for the project must come from the Legislature, which hasn’t been asked for such a large expansion of medical/surgical beds and maternity capacity since it approved the construction of Maple Grove Hospital more than 10 years ago. </p>
<p>“Most of the moratorium exceptions that have been granted in the last 10 years or so have generally been for mental health care services,” said Matt Anderson, a senior vice president with the Minnesota Hospital Association. </p>
<p>Minnesota established in 1984 a moratorium that blocks the expansion of existing hospital capacity without legislative approval. Legislators were concerned about the possible impact on health care spending, since each licensed bed can represent a significant expense in terms of staffing, technology and use of health care services. </p>
<p>At Regions, hospital officials said they would not need to expand the footprint of its existing campus to accommodate much of the proposed growth. And they contend the expansion won’t add to overall health care costs, since Regions is part of the integrated system at Bloomington-based HealthPartners that includes a health insurance company and a commitment to holding down expenses. </p>
<p>Plans call for 60 new medical/surgical beds in space the hospital vacated as part of a campus expansion project that was completed in 2009. Another 20 beds would be placed on a vacant floor within the hospital’s new tower for mental health patients, which opened in 2012. </p>
<p>The remainder of the beds would be used for maternity care, with most allowing for better flow of patients through the unit as opposed to growth, said Heidi Conrad, the hospital’s chief financial officer. Separately, the hospital is considering a plan for building a new center for mothers and babies, said Megan Remark, the chief executive at Regions. </p>
<p>The proposal for more maternity space comes just a few months after St. Joseph’s Hospital, which also is located in downtown St. Paul, closed its unit. </p>
<p>That closure, plus population growth, leads Regions to believe the hospital “needs an additional two licenses to increase services for mothers and babies and 18 licenses to transform our model of care,” according to its filing this month with the Minnesota Department of Health. </p>
<p>Regions said it is unique among hospitals in downtown St. Paul in using more than 90 percent of its licensed beds — a ratio that hospital officials believe will increase to 100 percent next year. That contrasts with utilization rates of 72 percent at nearby United Hospital and 60 percent at St. Joseph’s Hospital, according to the regulatory filing. </p>
<p>“Regions is one of the only hospitals using all of our bed licenses,” Remark said. “The other hospitals in the immediate east metro have an opportunity to grow by putting more beds that they have licenses for into use.” </p>
<p>A spokesman for Minneapolis-based Allina Health System, which owns United, did not comment. A spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services, which owns St. Joseph’s, did not immediately comment. </p>
<p>The Regions proposal will be reviewed by the state Health Department, which will make a recommendation to legislators about whether the project is in the public interest. The hospital hopes the Legislature will pass a bill granting an exception to the moratorium during the 2018 session, which ends in May. </p>
<p>The goal would be to gradually renovate space to add beds, starting in about a year to 18 months, Remark said. The timeline for bringing all beds into service stretches to 2040, according to the regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Market-share figures from Regions show the hospital has been gaining patients in recent years, as market share has slipped for St. Joseph’s as well as St. John’s Hospital in Maplewood. Both of the Regions rivals were operated by St. Paul-based HealthEast until it merged into Fairview earlier this year in the wake of somewhat weakened financial performance. </p>
<p>Regions officials, however, downplay the magnitude of the recent market-share shifts, and said they don’t expect to grow going forward by taking patients from other hospitals. </p>
<p>“We truly believe that when you look at the data … you look at the population growth and the aging of the population, in total the east metro is going to need more beds,” said Conrad. “We think St. Joe’s and United are going to need to be a part of the solution.” </p>
<p>Health Department figures show that Regions in 2015 ranked eighth among the 10 largest hospitals in the state in the number of licensed beds, and had a relatively high utilization rate for those beds. At the time, seven of the state’s largest hospitals were using less than 75 percent of their licensed beds, while the ratio exceeded 90 percent for Regions and two others. </p>
<p>Overall, hospitals in Minnesota aren’t using about 30 percent of their licensed beds, said Anderson of the Minnesota Hospital Association. So, not many hospitals have been expressing frustration, he said, about their bed capacity. </p>
<p>At Regions, officials say they have been “running hot” for quite a while now — meaning operating with a high occupancy rate. </p>
<p>“Running hot is kind of our new normal,” said Remark, the hospital CEO. “Having a little bit of flexibility just continues to make sure that you can accommodate when volume spikes up.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Asked to assess the significance of a victory over the Chicago Bears on Sunday — which would secure a first-round bye for the Vikings — tight end Kyle Rudolph paused, took a breath and proceeded to topple one of the NFL’s most banal clichés. </p>
<p>“I think this is the first time in my career where you can officially say a game counts as more than one,” Rudolph said. “Every week, we stand up here and say, ‘It’s one week. It’s one win. It’s one loss.’ This week counts as two wins, essentially. If we can go out and get a win, it guarantees us that we get next week off.” </p>
<p>There were enough Vikings players repeating some variation of the this-one-counts-double line Wednesday that it’s safe to assume they received it as a mantra from coach Mike Zimmer. And as the Vikings head into their regular-season finale against a 5-10 Bears team, it’s clear they will leave nothing to chance. </p>
<p>The Vikings (12-3) already have secured the NFC North title, and have a strong chance of clinching the conference’s No. 2 seed even if they lose to the Bears on Sunday. They’d secure a first-round bye with a Panthers loss, a Saints victory or Rams win in Week 17. </p>
<p>All three games that could provide help to the Vikings, though, are scheduled for late-afternoon starts Sunday, meaning Minnesota cannot watch the scoreboard to see if help is on the way during its game. </p>
<p>For the Vikings, it’s simple: Beat the Bears and get the bye. </p>

<p>“When you get in the playoffs, you have a chance,” Zimmer said. “Whatever it is, whether it’s sixth seed or second seed, you have a chance. I think our guys feel good about that. This game is important and we need to win this game. If you go back through the history of the league, there’s been some [No.] 6 seeds that made it. But most of the time, these teams that only have to play a couple games to get to the big one, there’s a lot more of those.” </p>
<p>Since 2012, teams with first-round byes are 16-4 in the division round of the playoffs, and only one team in that time (the 2012 Ravens) has reached the Super Bowl without a first-round bye. </p>
<p>Put in those terms, the trade is relatively simple; Instead of resting starters this week, the Vikings can work hard in a regular-season game and swap a hard-fought playoff game for a week of rest. </p>
<p>“It’s important to finish the season well, first of all,” guard Joe Berger said. “You don’t want to back your way into the playoffs. That’s a terrible way to go into the postseason. And second, [it’s] to have that week of recovery, health-wise.” </p>
<p>Vikings players aren’t expecting Zimmer would send them home for the entire wild-card week — “No, no chance,” Rudolph said — but they aren’t necessarily looking for that, either. </p>
<p>“Honestly, I think if you want an entire week off, when we have a chance to win two games and get to the Super Bowl, why would you really be here?” Rudolph said. “I have a feeling this bye week would be different than a bye week in the middle of the year, where guys can’t wait to get away. </p>
<p>‘‘Yeah, you do have to rest your body and rest your mind. But I think there will be an eagerness and a sense of urgency like, ‘Hey, let’s get back to work. We’ve got two games, and we could be playing in a Super Bowl in our own stadium.” </p>
<p>The Vikings won their first four games after their bye week in November, and it would seem likely they’d follow a similar schedule to what they did after returning from a victory over the Browns in London, spending at least a couple days of a playoff bye week with practice sessions focused on cleaning up their own flaws, before giving players a few days off and beginning preparation for a division round opponent. </p>
<p>They also have done strong work the past two weeks against teams with nothing at stake, beating the Bengals and Packers by a combined score of 50-7. With such a big payoff available to them Sunday against the Bears, the Vikings’ focus figures to be sharp. </p>
<p>“We have a lot of competitive guys that love to play football,” wide receiver Adam Thielen said. “We have a lot of guys that don’t care what the situation is — if we’re in the playoffs, out of the playoffs. We just want to go out there and play football, and I think that shows on the field, for sure.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Tucci Benucch will close its Mall of America location on Feb. 4, ending a 25-year run and bragging rights as one the mall’s original eateries, managers confirmed Wednesday. </p>
<p>Also closing will be the restaurant’s adjacent Magic Pan Crepe Stand. </p>
<p>Employees were notified about the change three weeks ago, including two servers who have been at the classic Italian Tucci restaurant since the mall’s opening day in 1992. Several others have worked at Tucci for nearly two decades. </p>
<p>“There have been a lot of tears,” said Tucci manager Erin Weeks. “Everybody loves it here.” </p>
<p>She noted that 80 affected employees from Tucci and Magic Pan Crepe will be given the chance to transfer to other local restaurants owned by Tucci’s parent firm, Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises. </p>
<p>Lettuce Entertain You also operates the Twin City Grill at MOA; three Big Bowl restaurants at the Ridgedale Center in Minnetonka, the Galleria Edina and Rosedale Center in Roseville; 14 Big Bowl Chinese Express sites inside Lunds &amp; Byerlys supermarkets; and “Tucci Italian” sites in Minnetonka and Edina, said spokeswoman Laura Nessel. </p>
<p>It is not yet known which tenant or tenants will fill the soon-to-be vacant sites that sit on the mall’s west side on the first floor. </p>
<p>“We are sad to see them go and thank all our guests who supported them throughout the years,” the Mall of America’s management said in a statement. “With change always comes opportunity and we look forward to exciting announcements for those spaces in 2018.” </p>
<p>About 40 of the more than 500 stores and restaurants at MOA opened when the mall did. </p>

<p>Crews in downtown St. Paul on Wednesday began constructing the Red Bull Crashed Ice course, which will host extreme ice skaters for the annual event in January. </p>
<p>Starting this year, the course will be gated for security reasons and attendees can buy premium tickets. Premium tickets cost $10 to $20, though spectators can pay up to $350 for additional perks like a heated bar and access to the starting line of the event, which runs Jan. 19 and 20. </p>
<p>“The premium ticketing option is just to offer the option for viewers to have a different viewing experience, to get different views and closer to the track,” said Alyssa Stalzer, account executive with New York-based M&amp;C Saatchi. </p>
<p>The sloping, curving course in front of the Cathedral of St. Paul runs more than 1,100 feet and takes about three weeks to build. Project manager Andrew Markey said workers on Wednesday began unloading seven trucks of scaffolding steel that arrived from Nashville. </p>
<p>“This weather is a little demotivating. But so far so good,” Markey said. </p>
<p>Workers first construct the scaffolding, then lay the plywood track, install hockey rink-style boards along the sides, assemble refrigerated matting and create the ice. </p>
<p>The course follows the same path as last year, Markey said, but has some new features like a large jump on the John Ireland Boulevard bridge over Interstate 94. </p>
<p>Markey said the frigid temperatures can slow the pace of work. </p>
<p>“The real challenge is when we start to make the ice, when we start running water and trying to keep all of our hoses from freezing,” he said. </p>
<p>He added that the site will be about evenly split between the premium and free zones, and there will be three entry gates. </p>
<p>Tickets are available at <a href="https://www.universe.com/events/red-bull-crashed-ice-2018-st-paul-tickets-saint-paul-ZM630P">tinyurl.com/crashed2018</a>. People can RSVP online for the free admission, but it is not necessary.</p>
<p>A $10 or $20 ticket on Friday or Saturday, respectively, allows viewing from the lower track. For $135 ($200 on Saturday), spectators can watch from the warmth of the Ice Club with an open bar. Three hundred dollars also buys access to the starting line and an after party at the Palace Theater. </p>
<p>“Everyone will be accommodated who wants to attend,” Stalzer said. </p>

<p>New house and apartment construction soared in December, ending a year to remember in Twin Cities residential real estate. </p>
<p>There was a 36-percent increase in single-family construction permits this month, with apartment developments experiencing a similar gain, Housing First Minnesota and the Builders Association of the Twin Cities reported Wednesday. </p>
<p>And for the full year, builders throughout the metro area pulled 6,113 permits to build 13,436 houses and rental units, the most since 2005, the trade groups said. Compared to last year, that represents a 14-percent increase in permits and a 36-percent increase in total units. </p>
<p>“Everyone was flat-out busy,” said Bob Michels, president of Housing First Minnesota and a Twin Cities builder. “It felt like the good old days.” </p>
<p>Demand for rentals has been stronger than for single-family houses for the eight years since the 2007-09 recession, but this year builders scrambled for both types of construction. </p>
<p> </p>

<p></p>
<p>Through November, there were just under 5,000 sales of newly built homes in the metro, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors (MAAR). That was up 18.5 percent from the first 11 months of 2016. Those figures don’t include new houses that were never listed through the Regional Multiple Listing Service. </p>
<p>For both apartments and houses, affordability is a growing concern as prices reached a new high in 2017. Increases are being driven by a combination of a shortage of housing and high construction costs. </p>
<p>As of November the median sale price of a new house in the Twin Cities was $329,000, or $174 per square foot, according to MAAR. That’s compared with $238,000, or $142, for an existing one. </p>
<p>“Our industry is facing a serious labor shortage along with high regulatory costs. Both will continue to constrain the homebuilding industry and have an impact on housing affordability in 2018,” said David Siegel, executive director of Housing First Minnesota. </p>
<p>Though the permit data is for the 13-county metro area, the bulk of that housing is being built in the cities and counties at the core. But there was more activity this year in outlying suburbs where land is more plentiful and less expensive. </p>
<p>In terms of total permits, Lakeville was the busiest city with 502. Plymouth was next with 380, followed by Blaine with 327. Lake Elmo issued the fourth most permits with 261. It was also the biggest gainer after issuing fewer than 30 permits in 2016. </p>
<p>“Excellent school districts are a major motivating factor for new home buyers in Lake­ville,” said Todd Stutz, president of Robert Thomas Homes, a semi-custom builder. </p>
<p>Last year, the company sold 94 homes in Lakeville’s Spirit of Brandtjen Farm, one of the most popular housing developments in the metro. Of his sales in that development, he said, house prices ranged from $400,000 to $1.1 million. Nearly 70 percent of those houses were to-be-built while about 30 percent were spec houses already in the company’s inventory. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Stutz said his current sales backlog is already about 20 percent higher than at this time a year ago. </p>
<p>“We are cautiously optimistic about the new home market in 2018 based upon positive job growth, historically low mortgage rates and consumer confidence,” Stutz said. </p>
<p>The local report mirrors a national trend. As of November, the latest data available, single-family permits reached a 10-year high, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. </p>
<p>In the coming year, the demand for single-family houses is expected to keep growing. </p>
<p>Nationwide, apartment construction is expected to show signs of easing as rising rents and vacancy rates stifle demand. That won’t be the case in the Twin Cities, where the apartment construction market is forecast to reach new highs. About 5,000 new units are expected to hit the market, up from about 3,500 this year. </p>
<p>Multifamily projects represented 57 percent of all new home construction in the metro this year. Minneapolis was the busiest for apartment construction with 1,690 total units. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By JOHN HANNA
                                                                                                                                            Associated Press</h4>
<p>TOPEKA, Kan. — The local district attorney announced Wednesday that he does not plan to file criminal charges against two Kansas police officers in the fatal shooting of a black man earlier this year, saying the man struggled with the officers and reached for a gun he had attempted to hide. </p>
<p>Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay released a seven-page legal analysis that was in line with the initial account Topeka police gave of the Sept. 28 shooting of 30-year-old Dominique White near a park. Kagay&#8217;s report described White, who had spent seven months in prison on a felony gun charge, as acting suspiciously after the officers responded to a call about shots being fired. </p>
<p>The district attorney&#8217;s analysis said police found a firearm loaded with eight rounds of ammunition on White, along with two loaded magazines and a knife. The report described White as &#8220;uncooperative and combative throughout the incident.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It was Mr. White&#8217;s actions that escalated these events,&#8221; Kagay said in his report, adding later that &#8220;no reasonable judge or jury would find the actions of either officer involved in this matter to be unlawful.&#8221; </p>
<p>The city has faced criticism over the handling of the shooting. It has not released the names of the officers involved, and police body camera footage wasn&#8217;t made public until Kagay showed it to news reporters Wednesday. </p>
<p>In the footage , which some media including The Topeka Capital-Journal posted online, the officers try to search White. He struggles briefly with the officers when one of them grabs his hands and wrists. They repeatedly urge him to stop, and he breaks away to flee from them. Moments later, multiple shots are fired at him. </p>
<p>White&#8217;s death certificate shows he died from gunshot wounds to his back. Kagay&#8217;s report confirms he was shot in the back. </p>
<p>White&#8217;s family members said in a statement that they are &#8220;incredibly disappointed&#8221; by the district attorney&#8217;s decision. </p>
<p>&#8220;My son was shot in the back while attempting to run away from officers,&#8221; White&#8217;s mother, Mary Theresa Wynne, said in the statement. &#8220;The video shows that they did not need to shoot and kill him.&#8221; </p>
<p>The family&#8217;s attorney is Gillian Cassell-Stiga of Beldock Levine &amp; Hoffman, the same law firm that represented the family of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was stopped by police on Staten Island in 2014 for selling untaxed cigarettes and died after a white officer placed him in a chokehold. While no one was prosecuted over Garner&#8217;s death, the city paid $6 million to settle a civil court lawsuit. </p>
<p>Topeka city spokeswoman Molly Hadfield said the Police Department will complete its own follow-up internal investigation before deciding whether to release the officers&#8217; names. </p>
<p>Kagay&#8217;s report noted that the area on Topeka&#8217;s east side where White was shot has had nearly weekly reports of gunshots, 32 reported robberies and two homicides in the past five years. The report described the two officers as police veterans familiar with the area. </p>
<p>White had been out of prison less than five months. He was ordered to serve probation after pleading guilty to a burglary charge in 2015, went to prison in October 2016 after pleading no contest to illegally possessing a firearm and was not supposed to have a gun. </p>
<p>According to Kagay&#8217;s report, White tried to walk away from officers when they arrived at the scene and ignored multiple requests to stop before they caught up with him. The report said his blood later tested positive for the presence of marijuana and methamphetamine. </p>
<p>White had gloves in his possession that tested positive for gunshot residue, the report said. That and other evidence suggested White fired the shots that brought officers to the area, according to the report. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is also little doubt that Mr. White was attempting to avoid being detained or searched by the officers,&#8221; Kagay said in the report. He added that the officers remained &#8220;calm and professional.&#8221; </p>
<p>White&#8217;s stepmother, Molly White, said the situation still shouldn&#8217;t have ended with his death. </p>
<p>&#8220;Had Topeka police exercised restraint, Dominique would be alive with us today,&#8221; she said in a statement. </p>

<p>NEW YORK — New York City says its jail population is below 9,000 for the first time since 1982 and is hailing the drop as a step toward closing the notorious Rikers Island jail complex. </p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio (dih BLAH&#8217;-zee-oh) said Wednesday the city is on track for a daily average jail population in December of about 8,980 people. </p>
<p>Crime has been falling for years in the nation&#8217;s largest city. Officials also reduced detention for people charged with low-level crimes and took steps to trim the numbers awaiting trial and serving sentences in jail. </p>
<p>Most inmates are at Rikers, where violence, mismanagement and corruption have come under scrutiny in recent years. </p>
<p>The Democratic mayor has said he wants to close Rikers and instead build smaller jails and expand existing ones. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Susan Shanard Burns-Stidger hated obituaries and funerals, so when she died of cancer on Dec. 10 at age 68, she had already <a href="http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/232934/?fullname=susan-shanard-burns-stidger">written her own tribute</a> — a simple, humor-filled note declaring that she had been “excused from the table.”</p>
<p>On Jan. 7 — after the holidays because she didn’t want to bother anyone — her husband, Gene Stidger, will host a happy hour at the Wayzata American Legion, in place of a funeral. </p>
<p>“That was her,” Stidger said. “She had a very smart wit about her. And a celebration of life, that’s it, was what she wanted.” </p>
<p>A Minnetonka native, Burns-Stidger grew up at the Panama Canal, where her father worked as a lawyer for Cargill. The family moved back to Minnesota when she was a teenager. Burns-Stidger graduated from Orono High School and went on to earn a four-year degree in Virginia. </p>
<p>She was an avid book lover, known for reading a book in a single day. As a young adult, she opened her own book shop. Later, she and her husband made a spare bedroom into a library, which they filled with nearly 3,000 books. </p>
<p>Stidger said they met later in life (both had been married previously) but had a passionate marriage, rarely separating and never going to bed angry. </p>
<p>About a decade ago, Burns-Stidger was nearing the end of her 43-year career working in the Hennepin County child protection services. She was looking for a golf partner to join her and another pair of friends at the Orono public course. Stidger was at the course that day and volunteered to play a round with Burns-Stidger. They hit it off and quickly started dating. And soon, they decided to adopt — a 115-pound black Labrador named Brut. </p>
<p>Six years later, they were married at the nine-hole golf course where they met. </p>
<p>When friends asked why they were getting hitched after living together for some time, Burns-Stidger would reply with a smile: “Well, we have to make the dog legitimate.” </p>
<p>Behind the quick humor, though, was a heart of gold, Stidger said. His wife — a woman who loved to drive fast, bet on horse races and grow flowers in shades of yellow, her favorite color — never had children of her own but was a mother figure in her community. </p>
<p>At the Wayzata American Legion, where she and her husband often went for happy hour to watch Wild games and visit with friends, she’d often lend money to folks who were down on their luck. </p>
<p>“She’d give people $50 or $100 to get back on their feet,” Stidger said. “Sometimes she’d pay their rent. And she never asked for it back.” </p>
<p>Both she and Stidger, 71, retired in their early 60s and spent much of their time traveling, taking their pontoon boat out on Lake Minnetonka near their Wayzata home and golfing in mediocre fashion — the ball occasionally going straight, Stidger said with a laugh. </p>
<p>“She was the best thing that ever happened to me,” he added tearfully. “She’s my angel in heaven, looking down.” </p>
<p>When Burns-Stidger got sick in August, she urged him not to tell anyone. She died quietly, at home. </p>
<p>In her obituary, she wrote: “Never lost God during my illness; wasn’t aware I’d misplaced him,” and urged people to “direct any memorials to a friend in need.” </p>
<p>Stidger hopes that friends, family and acquaintances will come for the celebration of Burns-Stidger at the Legion in an outpouring of love for the witty, giving love of his life. </p>
<p>“I’ll miss you,” she wrote to the impending crowd in her tribute. Then she added, in parentheses: “Well, most of you.” </p>

<p>The world’s richest people grew a whopping $1 trillion richer, according to a new report from Bloomberg News. That is about four times the gains they made last year. </p>
<p>That data come courtesy of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks and ranks the world’s 500 richest people. It attributes much of the economic growth to the stock market’s record-high year. (The MSCI World and Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 indexes grew about 20 percent this year.) </p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, clocked in as the world’s richest person, gaining $34.2 billion in wealth. (Bezos owns the Washington Post.) Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates came in at No. 2. Bezos is worth about $99.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. Gates is valued at $91.3 billion. </p>
<p>China’s 1 percent did particularly well. There are 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index, and they gained a combined $177 billion this year. That 65 percent jump was the largest for any of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of China Evergrande Group, a property developer, saw his personal bank accounts swell by $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year. </p>
<p>Ma Huateng, co-founder of Tencent Holdings, a Chinese technology investment firm, saw his fortune double to $41 billion, making him the second richest person in Asia. The number of billionaires in Asia has surpassed the number in the United States for the first time, according to a recent UBS Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. </p>
<p>Russia’s 27 richest residents did well, too, adding $29 billion to grow to $275 billion, despite the international economic sanctions imposed after President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. </p>

<p>Global losers included Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the richest person in Saudi Arabia, whose fortune dropped $1.9 billion to $17.8 billion after he was arrested as part of a corruption crackdown by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

<p>Bloomberg’s findings are yet another indication that massive accumulation of wealth at the top of the economic ladder is leading to spiraling inequality. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Associated Press</h4>
<p>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — The Latest on a rush to take advantage of a disappearing tax exemption (all times local): </p>
<p>6:30 p.m. </p>
<p>The IRS has issued guidance that could help homeowners figure out if they can save money by paying next year&#8217;s local property taxes early. </p>
<p>The federal tax overhaul signed by Republican President Donald Trump last week puts a new $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes. </p>
<p>People in some states have been lining up to pay their 2018 taxes early, hoping for one last shot at the exemption. </p>
<p>The IRS says Wednesday that some homeowners who pay real estate taxes early will be able to claim the deduction, but only if the taxes were assessed, billed and paid in 2017. </p>
<p>The IRS says people can&#8217;t guess at what next year&#8217;s assessment might be, pay that amount ahead of time and still get the deduction. </p>
<h4>___ </h4>
<p>12:48 p.m. </p>
<p>Homeowners are lining up in droves at local tax collection offices, hoping for a last chance to take a major tax deduction before it is wiped out next year. </p>
<p>In Hempstead, New York, town Tax Receiver Donald Clavin said &#8220;thousands&#8221; of people packed his office Tuesday trying to pay their 2018 property taxes a year in advance. </p>
<p>Similar scenes played out at government offices in towns and counties around the country with high local taxes. </p>
<p>The federal tax overhaul signed by President Donald Trump last week puts a new $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes. </p>
<p>People in some states are trying to delay that hike for a year by paying their 2018 taxes early. </p>
<p>The IRS hasn&#8217;t yet said how it would handle prepayments. </p>

<p>I appreciate the earnest tone and the call to read great literary classics that emerge from <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-40-greatest-books-we-all-should-read/466007713/">the piece</a> written by two law professors (“The 40 greatest books we all should read,” Dec. 23). However, I am dismayed, and unfortunately not surprised to see only four female authors in a list of 39.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, “Designating a ‘canon’ of great works is a daring enterprise.” And yet, so many male literary theorists and historians over the last three centuries have enthusiastically taken on this task, relegating the masterpieces written by women authors to the dustbin or to distinctly minor positions beyond the gates of the sacrosanct literary masterpiece club. </p>
<p>As a literature professor for 46 years, I think I have a well-defined sense of what constitutes timeless, universal and truly artful writing that moves readers to reflect deeply about the human condition. Yet I think that the “unapologetic” mission of Profs. Robert Delahunty and John Radsan to “pass on the traditions” they themselves “received during [their] educations” suggests that they have unquestioningly accepted the largely patriarchal standards of what constitutes great literature. </p>
<p>I am left wondering why the following books, for example, are left out of their list of greats: Edith Wharton’s “House of Mirth,” Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse,” George Eliot’s (Mary Ann Evans’) “Middlemarch,” Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple,” Amy Tan’s “The Joy Luck Club,” Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God” and Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice.” </p>
<p>Could it be that such books were not a staple of the masculine-centered “classical” education that this article’s authors had? What makes these literary works less durable, less powerful in presenting heroic, vividly drawn characters whose lives and situations are uniquely memorable and meaningful? What makes the above works by enormously skilled women writers less “great” than those by John Updike, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and Homer? </p>
<p>What makes “A Raisin in the Sun,” Lorraine Hansberry’s magnificent play on the dynamics of family life and the fragility of human dreams in a racist society, less great than Chekhov’s play “The Cherry Orchard” or Shakespeare’s “King Lear”? </p>
<p>And lastly, what criteria are Delahunty and Radsan using when they privilege Charles Dickens’ novel, “A Tale of Two Cities” over his contemporary Elizabeth Gaskell’s novel “Mary Barton”? </p>

<h3>In the annals of President Donald Trump’s odd dealings with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, give Trump credit for making a straightforward decision to defy Putin by <a href="http://www.startribune.com/us-officials-say-lethal-weapons-headed-to-ukraine/466068573/">supplying arms</a> to Ukraine.</h3>
<p>The State Department says the U.S. will provide Ukraine with “enhanced defensive capabilities” to protect itself against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. What this means, according to news reports, is that the U.S. is finally prepared to help Ukraine’s military punch back in a murky conflict cooked up by Putin. American weapons going to Ukraine will include Javelin anti-tank missiles and sniper rifles. </p>
<p>You may be surprised to learn there still is a conflict in eastern Ukraine. Indeed there is, with reports of intensified shelling in recent days, though an ostensible cease-fire has been in place for more than two years. Violence there has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 and driven 1.5 million people from their homes. </p>
<p>Putin is the scheming villain responsible for splintering Ukraine as part of his ambition to reassert Russian power. In 2014, he waltzed into Crimea (there is no better verb to describe his actions). Putin seized and annexed that vital region of Ukraine in the wake of Ukrainian political upheaval. He followed up by orchestrating the uprising in eastern Ukraine, intentionally destabilizing a country that had dreams of joining the European Union and NATO. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia but did little else after Putin took the Crimean Peninsula in what was the first big European land grab since World War II. Obama decided that providing lethal weapons to Ukraine would accomplish little but antagonize Putin. Yet refusing to arm Ukraine had the opposite effect:  It emboldened Putin. Obama’s hesitance is one reason why Russia-backed rebels control eastern Ukraine today. </p>
<p>Putin’s meddling in the affairs of other states won’t stop unless he is challenged. Trump has done that. </p>

<p>The recent reversal of a last-minute Obama administration move to block a mining project on the edge of northern Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is troubling but should come as a shock to no one. </p>
<p>A year ago, the state’s environmental advocates were hailing a major victory in their efforts to derail a risky new type of mining in Minnesota — copper and nickel extraction, which can discharge polluted water long after mining ends. A high-profile lobbying campaign led by Ely’s politically connected <a href="https://www.savetheboundarywaters.org/sites/default/files/public/attachments/15.fall_broadsides_beckyprofile_0.pdf">Becky Rom</a> helped convince outgoing Obama officials to reject a Chilean-owned mining company’s routine request to renew two leases on federally owned land near the BWCA.</p>
<p>But what is accomplished via political back channels can just as easily be undone, as the Star Tribune Editorial Board <a href="http://www.startribune.com/victory-for-environmentalists-and-bwca-eventually-could-backfire/407147396/">warned</a> in late 2016. The victory for environmentalists set an alarming precedent, injecting political advocacy at another point in the oversight process. That cracked open the door to not only undo the decision, but to allow interference elsewhere in what should be a consistent, data-driven review process.</p>
<p>Predictably, the U.S. Department of the Interior, now led by Republican Ryan Zinke, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/feds-ok-mining-on-edge-of-bwca/465989843/">announced</a> last Friday it has rejected the Obama’s administration’s legal basis for denying the two leases. This paves the way for federal officials to grant the leases sought by Twin Metals, which is owned by Chilean conglomerate <a href="http://www.antofagasta.co.uk/">Antofagasta</a>.</p>
<p>Some context is critical as Minnesotans weigh the developments. The decision does not greenlight mining on the leased parcels, located south of Ely and north of Babbitt. The company is still doing exploration. When it decides to go further, the project will have to go through environmental reviews and permitting, a process that has mired down PolyMet, another northern Minnesota copper mining project, for a decade. </p>
<p>The Interior decision also leaves intact an additional proposal by the outgoing Obama administration to “withdraw 235,000 acres of federal lands and minerals in northern Minnesota from future mining activity,” according to a Twin Metals statement. </p>
<p>Still, there’s reason to be alarmed about the credibility of future decisionmaking on the Twin Metals project, which unlike PolyMet is located within the BWCA watershed. The lease reversal by Obama officials, done in the last days of the administration, spotlighted the project. That put a big target on it under a new president and Republican-controlled Congress who are aggressively pursuing environmental protection rollbacks. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, legislation favorable to the mining industry has been introduced in Congress. A bill authored by U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, a Republican representing Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District, would restore Twin Metals’ leases and reopen the 235,000 acres to mining exploration. The bill <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2017/12/miner-problem-emmer-mining-bill-passes-house-who-will-take-it-senate">passed</a> the House last month but hasn’t cleared the Senate.</p>
<p>The Obama administration denial may have spurred Antofagasta to ramp up its own efforts to protect its project. Is it really mere coincidence that the head of the wealthy Luksic family, which controls Antofagasta, just happened late last year to the buy the Washington, D.C., <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanka-trumps-landlord-is-a-chilean-billionaire-suing-the-u-s-government-1489000307">home</a> that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner now rent?</p>
<p>The Editorial Board has long doubted that mining can be done safely so close to the BWCA. But it has put its faith in traditional environmental and permitting reviews that rely on data-driven analyses by state and federal agencies. The retaliatory politics now re-energizing the Twin Metals project cast serious doubt on the process for this particular project. </p>
<p>For that reason, it’s time to discuss other protective measures, such as legislation creating a permanent mining buffer zone around the BWCA. An act of Congress, rather than administrative measures, is a preferable, more transparent avenue to accomplish this. It’s a long shot but not impossible. U.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen, a Republican representing Minnesota’s Third District, <a href="https://paulsen.house.gov/press-releases/paulsen-votes-to-protect-boundary-waters/">voted</a> against Emmer’s bill. Paulsen also issued a moving <a href="">statement</a> on how the BWCA must be “preserved for future generations.”</p>
<p>Paulsen should put those words into action and lead on a buffer zone before it’s too late to protect one of America’s greatest natural treasures. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Helping someone at the scene of a recent auto accident sparked in me a resolve to publicly address health care costs and universal critical care coverage. I firmly believe Minnesotans want their elected leaders to stop drawing lines in the sand, stop the partisan quibbling, redouble their efforts to get something done with the health care crisis and do it in the coming 2018 session. </p>
<p>I have been asked if I would support a discussion regarding a state-based mandate for health care (“After lost mandate, what’s next for care?” <a href="http://www.startribune.com/congressional-aca-mandate-repeal-could-roll-back-health-coverage-gains/466008013/">editorial</a>, Dec. 24). Yes, I would engage such a conversation — why wouldn’t I? Health care is infected with big problems, and easy solutions are not looming on the horizon. Legislators are in no position to close their minds to an idea that has received support from both sides of the aisle over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>In 1989, an individual mandate to purchase health care insurance was championed by the politically conservative Heritage Foundation when Stuart Butler wrote: “If a young man wrecks his Porsche and has not had the foresight to obtain insurance, we may commiserate, but society feels no obligation to repair his car. But health care is different. If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance.” </p>
<p>An individual mandate resonates with conservative principles of personal responsibility, and comparisons are often made to similar requirements for auto insurance. But it is crucial to realize that an individual mandate requiring insurance companies to include too many “essential” benefits will likely sabotage the affordability and sustainability of such a mandate. Patients are capable of championing their own health care, and they should be allowed to choose what they want to buy. Teetotalers should not be forced to buy inpatient chemical dependency coverage, and seniors may want to invest their dollars on maladies of aging rather than prenatal care. Choice matters! </p>
<p>Public and private entities have both indicated strong support for a health care insurance mandate. Brainstorming and discussion may help create a blueprint for catastrophic coverage for such essentials as hospitalization, access to generic and select trade name medications, emergency room visits for true emergencies and mental health problems. (Please trust my 30 years in the trenches on at least this one point — no one knows when a mental health crisis might occur, so coverage of some sort is indeed essential.) </p>
<p>Let’s not forget that Medicare started in 1965 as a limited part A hospital-only plan and it grew thereafter. We can take a lesson from this initiative. Just because we can’t do everything doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do something. Indeed, we should do it now. </p>
<p>As a starting point, maybe everyone can agree that people should not die on the streets from heart attacks — but also that not every wart, runny nose or incidental hernia needs to be paid for by a third party. </p>
<p>But a mandate for health insurance is just one idea needing to be explored in the coming months, and individual coverage is not the only sector of the insurance marketplace clamoring for attention. Employer-based insurance is experiencing its own escalating affordability crisis. Some earnest soul-searching needs to happen at the Capitol — soon! </p>
<p>The Senate Select Committee on Health Care Consumer Access and Affordability has deliberated on numerous cost-reduction issues, including pharmaceutical prices, narrow networks, transparency of fees, low-value services, end-of-life decisions and protecting patient-doctor relationships. </p>
<p>As elected leaders, we need to roll up our sleeves and get the job done. If we don’t, we will have failed our constituents. </p>
<p>Hospitals all over the state are in trouble financially because too many bills go unpaid and charity care is crippling their ability to respond to community needs. </p>
<p>Parents and patients are being forced to make impossible choices as to whether critical medical care for their children or themselves should be subordinated to paying bills or house payments — a health crisis should not invoke fear of bankruptcy or a second mortgage. </p>
<p>Home health aides work for $12 per hour with no benefits, and the shortage of these compassionate servants intensifies while the sick and infirm pray for help and a bath. </p>
<p>The time has come for statesmanship — and this will require attention to patient choice, unintended consequences, sustainability, representation from both parties, civil tongues, and a passion for what best serves our state, our nation and the common good. </p>
<p>(Maybe now is the time for Gov. Mark Dayton to take the lead and host a breakfast with Senate and House leaders from both sides of the aisle to determine the level of resolve for addressing our health care crises in 2018. I suspect such a meeting would be more fruitful if cellphones, egos and sound bites are checked at the door.) </p>

<p>On Dec. 13, the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee passed the mountain bikes in wilderness bill (HR 1349), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. This bill weakens the 1964 Wilderness Act to allow mountain bikes and other wheeled contraptions into every wilderness in the nation (“A matter of wheels in the wilderness,” <a href="http://www.startribune.com/wheels-in-the-wilderness-bill-to-allow-bikes-divides-outdoor-lovers/464650143/">Dec. 17</a>).</p>
<p>The bill passed 22-18, after initially failing 15-19. U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, the committee chairman, brought the bill back up again after more Republicans had arrived at the committee markup session. All Democratic members of the committee opposed the bill, and one Republican (U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.) also voted against it. The bill will now go to the House floor for a vote. </p>
<p>A mountain biking splinter group, the Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), has joined forces with the worst anti-wilderness Republicans to promote this attack on wilderness. And sadly, both the STC and the Republican promoters in Congress rely on a number of outright falsehoods and deliberate distortions to advance the bill. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Republican committee leadership corrupted the hearing process and refused to allow any testimony on the bill, but for the STC. Not one of the 133 conservation organizations that co-signed a letter of opposition to the bill, no wilderness experts from academia or the legal profession, and no wilderness specialists from any of the four federal land management agencies that administer wilderness were allowed to testify or correct the falsehoods. </p>
<p>Here are some of their most common misrepresentations and outright lies: </p>
<p>• That the 1964 Wilderness Act doesn’t ban bikes in wilderness. Not true. The Wilderness Act specifically prohibits “mechanical transport” in wilderness, and the law also mentions the threat of “growing mechanization.” Bikes are mechanical machines. A recent Los Angeles Times article quoted Ed Zahniser, a retired National Park Service official whose father (Howard) wrote the Wilderness Act: “The act clearly says no mechanized uses. How could they possibly say the original act allows this? They are just making it up.” </p>
<p>• That the U.S. Forest Service unilaterally banned bikes in 1984. Not true. It was the Wilderness Act that banned bikes, not the Forest Service. And none of the other three federal agencies that oversee wilderness has ever interpreted the Wilderness Act as allowing bicycles. Though the initial Forest Service regulations were confusing, the agency’s regulations were made more explicit in 1977 to specifically mention bikes. Biking bill proponents claim that because the agency’s original regulations mentioned “mechanical transport” but didn’t explicitly name bikes, it means bikes were allowed. By that measure, snowmobiles, ATVs, and helicopters should also have been allowed because the regulations mentioned only “motor vehicles.” </p>
<p>• That mechanical transport in the Wilderness Act only means motorized vehicles. Not true. The Wilderness Act specifically bans both “mechanical transport” and “motor vehicles.” </p>
<p>• That wheelchairs are prohibited in wilderness. Not true. The 1990 amendments to the Americans with Disabilities Act allow both motorized and nonmotorized wheelchairs in wilderness with reasonable safeguards to avoid abuse of the exception. And many people with disabilities want to and do enjoy nonmechanized and nonmotorized experiences in wilderness. </p>
<p>• That mountain bikers are prohibited from visiting wilderness. Not true. Only the machines that mountain bikers ride are prohibited in wilderness; mountain bikers are free to hike, paddle or horseback ride like other wilderness visitors. </p>
<p>• That mountain bikes don’t do as much trail damage as horses in wilderness. Horses certainly create impacts, as do hikers, but the test of whether something is appropriate in wilderness goes beyond physical impacts. Mountain bikes destroy wilderness character by the mere presence of these modern machines, by their speed, by their penetration of remote areas, by their destruction of solitude, by their disruption of wildlife and much more. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, HR 1349 is a dangerous attempt to weaken the Wilderness Act and crack open the National Wilderness Preservation System to bikes and other machines, and who knows what else afterward. It would be extraordinarily sad if this bill becomes law, but it would be even worse because it is based on falsehoods and deliberate distortions. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Retiring Minneapolis City Council President Barbara Johnson deserves commendation for her long service as a leader and an apology from the Star Tribune for the Dec. 27 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-s-pay-hike-needlessly-sneaky/466668853/">editorial</a> “Council pay hike needlessly sneaky.” Johnson and the other council members were simply being practical. Anyone who reads this otherwise good newspaper knows that pay for public officials is a contentious subject. Somehow, proud Minnesotans don’t think elected officials should be paid anywhere near what the private sector pays for CEOs and boards of directors running a company with a $1.5 billion annual budget. And somehow, when we extol our virtues as a city compared with Portland and Seattle, we don’t mention that they pay their council members $20,000 a year more than we do.</p>
<p>We have been lucky so far because we have a tradition of getting generally competent and honest public officials on the cheap. But as readers of this newspaper may also have noticed recently, we are neglecting civics education in our public schools. This means we are raising a generation of children who know little about government and how it works. Respect for government and what it does is declining. And with the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission we are seeing massive amounts of money being poured into campaigns, now including local campaigns. Special interest groups with a narrow agenda and money-raising ability can select, train and finance candidates who will fight for their agenda. </p>
<p>Any new mayor and council members who made raising their salaries an early priority would know it would be political suicide, as well as time-consuming. Those on the current council were political realists, exercising leadership, which is what we taxpayers who believe government is necessary pay them to do. Transparency may be an ideal, but it is not always fair or practical. The council broke no laws or rules. It simply exercised leadership for the good of the city. </p>

<h3>GUNS </h3>
<h4>Base concealed-carry reciprocity on data (which looks favorable) </h4>
<p>The Dec. 26 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/push-for-gun-permits-across-state-lines-concerns-minnesota-law-enforcement/465038423/">article</a> “Permit push for guns is divisive” says that “law enforcement leaders” are concerned that a proposal to make any state’s permits for carrying concealed guns applicable in all other states “could harm public safety.” But later the article says that 24 state attorneys general wrote to Congress supporting the bill while only 17 wrote against the bill. It sounds to me like at least some law enforcement leaders support the bill.</p>
<p>The article didn’t provide data as to whether concealed-carry permit holders commit crimes at a higher rate than other citizens. According to a report by John R. Lott Jr. of the Crime Prevention Research Center, permit holders not only commit fewer crimes than the general population but also commit fewer crimes than police officers. The general population commits 3,813 crimes per 100,000 people per year. Policemen committed 103 crimes per 100,000 officers per year. Permit holders in Texas and Florida committed crimes at one-sixth the rate of policemen. Of course, the crime rates of permit holders vary from state to state. There may be some states where permit holders commit crimes at a higher rate than in Texas and Florida. But even if they commit crimes at seven times the rate of Texas and Florida, the rate would be comparable to that of policemen and much lower than that of the general population. </p>
<p>The decision about whether to allow concealed-carry permits to apply in all states should be made based on data. And it is the responsibility of the Star Tribune and other newspapers to supply that data. The article didn’t provide the necessary data to make the decision and instead relied mostly on quotes from opponents of the bill. </p>

<h3>GREAT BOOKS </h3>
<h4>Don’t limit yourself to classics </h4>
<p>Reading the Dec. 23 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-40-greatest-books-we-all-should-read/466007713/">commentary</a> “The 40 greatest books we all should read,” I recalled being at a local bookstore doing a signing for a book I had written. A man approached, and we had a brief exchange. Then he put a self-satisfied smile on his face and said he only reads the classics and promptly walked away. I didn’t say anything, but thought to myself that he must let other people decide what he will read.</p>
<p>Making a list of the greatest books, and teaching only those books, indicates the attitude that anything worth reading has already been written and we shouldn’t bother with whatever is being written today or will be in the future. In reality, those books did not start out as influential classics. They became that way because authors were willing to write new works and, when they first came out, readers were willing to pay attention to books that did not have any durability or influence. </p>
<p>While attention should be given to the classics, people should also be taught to look to contemporary and little-known writing and decide for themselves what to read. </p>
<p>Bill Cutler, Oak Park Heights </p>
<h3>THE CULTURE </h3>
<h4>Fellowship without judgment — that’s the spirit we need </h4>
<p>Driving down to the Mankato area the day after Christmas, I passed a little apple orchard painted neon yellow. A sign at the orchard said “Merry Christmas” on one side and “Season’s Greetings” on the other — subtly skewering a political divide small businesses must straddle not just at this time of year but all year long these days. </p>
<p>I reflected on the sign as I continued on my way to New Creation Church, a large, evangelical congregation that for the last two years has opened its doors to about 400 people in the Native American and European-American communities who come together to heal the old self-inflicted wounds created when racial hatred, fear and the breakdown of the U.S. government during the Civil War led to starvation, massacre and finally the largest mass hanging in our nation’s history. </p>
<p>Members of New Creation welcomed me and my humanist/agnostic/atheist companions into their kitchen and spiritual home without judgment and stood beside us in common cause and purpose as we fed the 400 folks bent on sharing bread and fellowship. Here’s hoping that love can overcome hate, that kindness can heal and that even highway signs can eventually make peace with themselves. </p>

<p>NEW YORK — A ferry carrying more than two dozen people hit a sandbar and got stuck for hours Wednesday, spurring an evacuation on a frigid night in the waters off New York City. </p>
<p>No injuries were reported in the second stranding in a month for the city&#8217;s newly-expanded ferry service. </p>
<p>The city-sponsored, privately run ferry left the Rockaway peninsula in Queens with 27 people aboard at 5:15 p.m., bound for lower Manhattan on a 20-degree evening. About 10 minutes into the trip, &#8220;we just came to a screeching halt,&#8221; passenger Jake Nicholson said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone pretty much went flying,&#8221; he later told The Associated Press by phone from the boat, stuck in the waters between Rockaway and Brooklyn. He said he was nearly tossed over the row of seats in front of him, and his phone ended up a few rows away. </p>
<p>Nicholson, a 21-year-old senior at Loyola University Maryland, said passengers initially were told that there was a mechanical error, then that the boat had hit a sandbar and that the captain tried to back the boat off it. </p>
<p>Four hours later, he, his brother and a friend were waiting their turn to get off the chilly ferry in the small, inflatable boats rescuers were using because of the shallow water. By then, passengers were &#8220;just sitting down, trying to stay warm,&#8221; said Nicholson, who&#8217;d missed the Washington Capitals-New York Rangers game that was the reason for his ferry trip. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was difficult because they had to climb down a ladder, a 12-foot straight ladder, down the back of the ferry onto our boat and then transferred onto several different boats — so a very slow, tedious, time-consuming operation,&#8221; said fire department Chief John Esposito. </p>
<p>The evacuation got underway around 7:30 p.m. Officials said 23 passengers and one crewmember were safely removed sometime before 11 p.m. The disabled boat was expected to be towed off the sandbar overnight. </p>
<p>Phone and email messages to the ferry company, Hornblower Inc., weren&#8217;t immediately returned. </p>
<p>The ferry to and from Rockaway is part of a $335 million effort , launched this summer, to use the waterways to ease strains on New York&#8217;s public transportation system. The $2.75-a-ride service is separate from the famous free ferry that has long traveled between Manhattan and Staten Island. </p>
<p>Last month, more than 100 passengers were rescued from a Rockaway-bound ferry that ran aground off lower Manhattan. </p>

                                    </div>
<p><span class="dateline">WASHINGTON </span>– The Trump administration is setting the stage to unveil tough new trade penalties against China early next year, moving closer to an oft-promised crackdown that some U.S. business executives fear will ignite a costly battle.</p>
<p>Corporate officials and analysts closely tracking trade policy said that President Donald Trump is expected to take concrete actions on disputes involving China within weeks. </p>
<p>Trump is due by the end of January to render his first decision in response to petitions from U.S. companies seeking tariffs or import quotas on Chinese solar panels and washing machines manufactured in China and its neighbors. </p>
<p>U.S. trade officials in both cases have determined that domestic manufacturers have been injured by surging imports and have recommended that he erect new trade barriers. </p>
<p>China is Minnesota’s biggest export market outside North America, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development. Companies in the state sold $615 million of goods to customers in China during the third quarter, including $173 million worth of machinery and $167 million worth of medical equipment. </p>
<p>Trump could also order new limits on Chinese investment in the U.S. or raise tariffs unilaterally — a likely violation of U.S. commitments to the World Trade Organization — pending the outcome of a broader investigation into Beijing’s alleged failure to protect foreign companies’ intellectual property rights, analysts say. </p>
<p>White House action is also due on a Commerce Department probe triggered by worries about the national security impact of rising imports of Chinese steel and aluminum. </p>
<p>“Their intent is to bring shock and awe,” said Scott Kennedy, an expert on Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They’re not kidding around.” </p>
<p>On Dec. 6, Robert Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, had a contentious discussion of administration trade policy with members of the US-China Business Council’s board of directors, which includes chief executives of companies such as Chubb Insurance and General Motors, said three executives familiar with the session. </p>
<p>During the closed-door briefing for chief executives with business in China, Lighthizer said that U.S. complaints about Chinese trade practices could not be resolved simply by additional talks with Beijing, and he appeared indifferent to concerns that the administration’s hard line risked rupturing a $600 billion annual trade relationship. </p>
<p>A Lighthizer spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment. The business group also declined to comment. </p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how extensive the administration actions will be. Trump’s repeated campaign vows to retaliate against China for policies that he says contributed to the loss of millions of U.S. jobs have yet to translate into concrete action. During a visit to Beijing last month, the president blamed his White House predecessors rather than Chinese President Xi Jinping for the yawning bilateral trade deficit. </p>
<p>That gap has only grown since Trump became president, despite his “America First” rhetoric. Through the first 10 months of this year, the U.S. incurred a $309 billion trade deficit with China, up from $289 billion during the same period one year earlier. </p>
<p>“So far, it’s been the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy turned on its head: Speak loudly and carry a small stick,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonprofit established by the United Steelworkers union and major steelmakers. </p>
<p>Still, in recent weeks, there have been mounting signs of the president’s intention to act. In a new national security strategy, Trump earlier this month described China as a strategic competitor and said that when it comes to trade, the U.S. “will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating or economic aggression.” </p>
<p>The White House document was issued less than a month after the United States formally told the WTO that China did not qualify as a “market economy” under the trade body’s rules. </p>
<p>In a dispute with the European Union, China insists that it was promised the designation by now under the terms of its 2001 membership in the WTO. The European Union and the United States insist that the Chinese state’s role in the economy remains too large to justify granting China market economy treatment. As a nonmarket economy, China is subject to higher anti-dumping duties under U.S. trade law, making the issue more than a matter of bragging rights. </p>
<p>The president also previewed the tougher line in a speech last month in Danang, Vietnam, saying that the U.S. now expects its trade “partners will faithfully follow the rules just like we do.” </p>
<p>U.S. officials say that China has not lived up to the bargain struck when it joined the WTO. Market liberalization has slowed or reversed, especially since Xi became Communist Party general secretary in 2012. State-owned enterprises get preferential financing and permit approvals and are formidable competitors for multinational corporations. </p>
<p>Total financial flows into the U.S. from China topped $46 billion last year, almost 10 times the figure from 2011. </p>
<p>U.S. business leaders anticipate a difficult 2018. “Our sense,” said Jeremie Waterman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “is that everything is on the table.” </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">A 37-year-old is charged with first-degree burglary while committing assault.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Libor Jany</h4>
<p>When a young girl got home from school one day last week, she was startled by the sight of a stranger running through her Minneapolis living room, screaming, authorities said. </p>
<p>The suspect, Richard Lee Smith, 37, allegedly punched the girl, whose age was not disclosed but who is a juvenile, and then choked her with both hands during the Dec. 22 incident, according to a criminal complaint filed in Hennepin County District Court. She managed to fight him off and break free, before running outside for help, the complaint said. </p>
<p>Police arrived at the 2500 block of Grand Avenue S. to find the front door locked but went inside after getting a key from the victim’s mother, and found Smith hiding in one of the bedrooms. Investigators say the clothes match those worn by a suspect in a restaurant robbery the previous night. A pile of items he intended to steal was found nearby, police said, and a car previously reported stolen was parked outside. </p>
<p>When police found her, the victim had red marks around her neck, the complaint said. In addition, she had bruises and swelling on her forehead and a black eye with broken blood vessels. </p>
<p>Smith, who was charged with first-degree burglary while committing assault, remains jailed in lieu of $150,000 bail. His preliminary court date was set for Thursday. </p>

<p>Former Vikings linebacker <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Chad Greenway </strong>has stayed close to the NFL and the Vikings by teaming up with the Super Bowl Host Committee to help lead volunteer efforts in the Twin Cities for Super Bowl LII in February. But when Greenway was asked if he missed the game itself, he didn’t hesitate to say no.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been too tough, to be honest with you,” he said. “As my career was winding down, I kind of knew that I wanted to be done playing. This first year out has actually been pretty enjoyable. I have had a lot of fun. It has been fun to watch the guys win and play so well, but I haven’t missed it.” </p>
<p>Greenway was with the Vikings for 11 seasons (but only played 10, after missing his rookie season in 2006 because of a torn ACL) and finished fourth in franchise history with 1,334 tackles. And while he said he loved playing football, one of the big reasons he was fine with walking away from the game was because he still had his health. </p>
<p>“The biggest thing is I have four kids, and I’m married and have a wife. So it’s one of those things where I’m more concerned with my health and my longevity at this point,” Greenway said. “It didn’t factor into me wanting to be done, I just knew I didn’t want to play anymore. It was a situation where I knew I was ready to move on, and I haven’t looked back since it happened.” </p>
<p>So in his first year away from the game, Greenway has focused on his charitable work and his volunteer work for Super Bowl LII. </p>
<p>“I do a lot of speaking events but as far as foundation events, we have most of them coming up in the spring,” he said about his <a href="https://www.chadgreenway.org/">Lead the Way Foundation</a>. “We’re pretty quiet right now but the foundation has been growing. Even this year in retirement it has been a great season, probably our best year as a foundation, actually. It has been good.”</p>
<p>And when it comes to Super Bowl LII, Greenway said the volunteer committee received 30,000 applicants. They narrowed that down to 10,000 volunteers who will greet people at the airport, direct them around the city and otherwise help out-of-town visitors. </p>
<h3><strong>Linebacking corps</strong></h3>
<p>Greenway was asked about the Vikings linebackers this season. </p>
<p>“ <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Ben Gedeon </strong>is playing the position I played last year and he has played solid, steady football,” Greenway said. “He has been a really good player and a great special teams guy. And of course <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Eric</strong> [<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Kendricks</strong>] and <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Anthony </strong>[<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Barr</strong>] have been playing lights out.</p>
<p>“Those guys, as they came in, you could tell they had a lot of talent. As I got older in my career, you could feel those guys and their presence was going to be good. They are good players. Now that is sort of their defense, as backers, that’s kind of why they are playing so well because those guys are the core of it. They are in the middle of the [defense] and playing well.” </p>
<p>Greenway said the Vikings defense, ranked first in the NFL in total defense (280.9 yards allowed per game), is better than last season and might be the best they’ve had in some time. </p>
<p>“The numbers tell me that yes they are, absolutely,” he said. “The numbers tell me that, [from] the pass rush on the back end to the way we’re covering the middle of the field, the number two rush defense in the league (87.1 yards allowed per game, just behind the Eagles’ 75.9). We’re way better on third downs, so yeah, this is the best defense we have had here in a long time.” </p>
<p>Greenway said he watches games a bit differently these days. </p>
<p>“I look to see if the baby needs something or if the kids need something,” he said. “When I watch the game, I just try to enjoy them. I don’t try to watch too much of the ins and outs of it, just try to enjoy it as a fan.” </p>
<p>The Vikings already have their most victories since 2009, when they eventually lost 31-28 to the Saints in the NFC Championship Game. If they finish 13-3 by beating the Bears at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, they will have their best record since 1998, when they went 15-1. </p>
<p>“The NFL is a wins-and-losses sort of business, so any time you are winning, it’s so much fun to be a part of that and be around that,” Greenway said. “You can just tell the guys are having fun here, very businesslike, but they’re having fun. </p>
<p>“For me, 2009 with the NFC title game was the best run that I went on. Only playoff game I won was that year. Other than that, any time you made the playoffs it was a fun situation, but we didn’t have a lot of success there, unfortunately.” </p>
<p>Greenway said he keeps in contact with a lot of friends on the team and sees them regularly. He was asked if he had any thoughts, as someone closely tied to Super Bowl LII, about what it would mean for the Vikings to play in the game here. </p>
<p>“To have a home game for the Super Bowl would be pretty amazing,” he said. “With the way they’re playing, I think they’re very capable.” </p>
<h3><strong>Robison’s decision</strong></h3>
<p>After Greenway’s retirement, <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Brian Robison </strong>became the longest-tenured Vikings player, in his 11th season with the franchise.</p>
<p>From 2011 to 2016, Robison was one of the better defensive linemen in the NFL, recording 44½ of his 59 career sacks, with a career high of nine in 2013. </p>
<p>But this season his playing time has been more limited, playing 55.9 percent of the Vikings’ defensive snaps, which ranks 12th on the team. Still, Robison has been effective when he is on the field, recording three sacks and 18 tackles. </p>
<p>Earlier this season, he was asked if it bothers him to play less than in previous years. </p>
<p>“I’m not worried about that. I’m worried about winning ballgames,” he said. “It’s not about me. It’s about our team and winning ballgames and trying to be where we want to be at the end of the year, chasing our ultimate goal.” </p>
<p>He added that when it comes to the defensive line, the most important thing this season has been their combined play. </p>
<p>“It’s about all four of us working together. It’s not about individuals,” he said. “This is about the Minnesota Vikings. It’s not about <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Danielle </strong>[<strong style="font-weight: 500;">Hunter</strong>], it’s not about Brian Robison, it’s not about <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Tom Johnson</strong>, it’s not about <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Everson Griffen</strong>, it’s about the Minnesota Vikings defense working together and being on the same page.”</p>
<p>Robison, 34, is earning a $3.9 million base salary this season and is on the books for 2018 at $3.2 million. </p>
<p>The Vikings could surely still use Robison’s veteran presence in the locker room and on the field next season. When asked if he has any plans to retire, he said that for now it’s not on his mind. </p>
<p>“I don’t know. I take it one day at a time,” he said. “I’m not thinking about the future. I’ll worry about that in the offseason and see how my body feels and just take it day by day. We’ll see where it goes.” </p>

The San Diego State product, who was named the best specialist at the 2016 Senior Bowl, was with the Rams in training camp last year. He spent time with the Bears and Broncos this year.</div>
                                    </div>
<p> </p>
<p>Jeff Overbaugh was one of two long snappers invited to the Senior Bowl in January 2016. He had handled those duties impeccably at San Diego State after arriving there from Service High School in Anchorage, Alaska. </p>
<p>The Senior Bowl workouts get wall-to-wall coverage with NFL.com and the NFL Network. Nuggets are passed along on all players, including the information that Overbaugh camped out among Kodiak bears during his adventurous youth in Alaska. </p>
<p>The Kodiaks were mentioned to Overbaugh during an interview in a small anteroom at Winter Park on Wednesday. He smiled and said: “Yeah, I think there was a little mix-up between me and my guy [Lance] Zierlein on that one. I never did go camping at the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.” </p>
<p>Zierlein is a draft analyst, talk radio host and NFL.com contributor, and apparently it was his information on Overbaugh and sleeping with the Kodiaks that keeps getting repeated when the job-seeking long snapper gets a media mention. </p>
<p>No camping out when surrounded by large bears, then? </p>
<p>“Not Kodiaks,’’ Overbaugh said. “We did camp out at Katmai National Park. There are quite a few grizzlies around there.” </p>
<p>Kodiaks. Grizzlies. I’d say Zierlein was close enough. </p>
<p>Overbaugh was with his girlfriend, Emily Carper, at her parents’ home near San Diego when he received a Christmas call to head for the Twin Cities. The Vikings wanted him at Winter Park for a tryout to replace injured Kevin McDermott as Sunday’s long snapper vs. the Bears. </p>
<p>The Vikings went with Overbaugh ahead of veteran Justin Drescher for what seems to be a one-game assignment. McDermott is expected back when the playoffs start for the Vikings, presumably on the weekend of Jan. 13-14. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure how many tryouts this year — three teams before the season started, then nine or 10 one-day tryouts during the season,’’ Overbaugh said. “I’m not looking back at those. I’m just preparing for this Sunday against the Bears.” </p>
<p>Overbaugh spent the morning at U.S. Bank Stadium working with kicker Kai Forbath and punter Ryan Quigley. He was impressed with the Vikings’ $1.15 billion palace, while also not a stranger to large domes. </p>
<p>The Dome in Anchorage was the locale where Overbaugh spent many hours working on ball-snapping skills, with his father Bill serving as holder or punter. </p>
<p>“Jeff’s goal was to play Division I football,” Bill Overbaugh said. “When he was a sophomore, Ray Guy’s group came through here with a camp for punters, kickers and long snappers. </p>
<p>“He was introduced to techniques to develop the quick-twitch muscles needed by a long snapper. He wasn’t big enough to be a lineman; he’s about 6-1 and 240 now. He saw long snapping as his way into college football.’’ </p>
<p>Overbaugh would go through the drills, and then snap the football to his father, in workouts in that large dome lasting two or three hours. He also went to offseason camps and wound up with a scholarship to be the long snapper at San Diego State. </p>
<p>“It’s a different world for long snappers,’’ Mike Morris said. “When I got into it, we were pretty much self-taught. I tried to do what I saw as a kid watching Bobby Bell with Kansas City and Mick [Tingelhoff] with the Vikings. Red Silvera and Rex McClanahan were a couple of old college coaches who showed me a few things.” </p>
<p>Morris played 13 NFL seasons and was the Vikings’ snapper for every game from 1991 to 1999. Early on, you were expected to back up at a line position; now, long snapper is a stand-alone position. </p>
<p>“You have to be perfect, too,’’ Morris said. “Coaches aren’t going to miss a Super Bowl because they had a bad snap. There are guys like this kid [Overbaugh], working on it full-time, waiting for an opening, trying to show they can throw a strike every time.” </p>
<p>Morris and Overbaugh have this in common: Morris never had a bad snap that directly cost his NFL team points, and Overbaugh was a perfect 510-for-510 on snaps at San Diego State. </p>
<p>He had a chance to snap for punts in a couple of exhibition games with the Bears. On Sunday, he will be snapping in a true NFL game for the first time. </p>
<p>Bill and Julia Overbaugh, and older son Willie, are flying in from Anchorage on Friday to be there. Willie is back home in Alaska, enjoying those grand spaces, as his brother works on throwing fastball strikes to holders and punters. </p>
<p>“Those boys grew up as quite the outdoorsmen,’’ Bill said. “They were up for anything. They went on a kayaking trip through the Grand Canyon, at ages 12 and 11.” </p>
<p>Sounds like a good way to get started on those quick-twitch muscles. </p>

<p>Thousands of Super Bowl visitors are about to experience a downtown Minneapolis rite of passage: getting lost in the skyways. </p>
<p>But planners for the big event have strategies to get perplexed partiers to their destinations, including an army of volunteer guides and a specially designed phone navigation app. </p>
<p>“You kind of know that look,” Steve Cramer said with a laugh, referring to the puzzled expressions on the faces of skyway newbies as they try to plot a route. “It’s an intricate system, not always intuitive. And for folks not from the community, it’s all brand-new.” </p>
<p>It’s Cramer’s job to make things easier. He co-leads an arm of the Super Bowl Host Committee charged with “wayfinding,” a fancy word for helping people get from Point A to Point B with a minimum of fuss and confusion. </p>
<p>It’s not a slam-dunk. Even longtime skyway users sometimes find themselves adrift. </p>
<p>“I still get lost!” said Arianna Gomes, a downtown Minneapolis worker for three years. “But I love them. They keep you warm.” </p>

<p>Larry Chevalier, a commercial real estate broker, said his visiting business clients are always impressed by the skyways. </p>
<p>“We’re unique,” he said. “People coming from other cities will be blown away.” </p>
<p>That’s the feeling Cramer hopes Super Bowl visitors will take away. In his day job as president and CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council, Cramer has a lot of experience with the skyways and people’s reactions to them. Downtown Minneapolis has nearly 9 miles of the elevated walkways, making it “as far as we know, the largest connected system anywhere,” he said. </p>
<p>But the focus of Super Bowl planners is on a few core routes linking Target Center on the western edge of downtown, the Minneapolis Convention Center to the south and U.S. Bank Stadium to the east. The central crossroads for those core routes is the Crystal Court in IDS Center, where ESPN will be setting up its <a href="http://www.startribune.com/espn-chooses-ids-crystal-court-for-super-bowl-week-set/455860383/">main broadcast center</a>.</p>
<p>Along the core skyway routes, users will see “a lot of volunteers” giving directions until 10 p.m., Cramer said. More than 2,000 volunteers will be working the skyways during the Super Bowl festivities, with 120 on duty at all times. There will be prominent event signs with specific directions: “This way to U.S. Bank Stadium,” for example. </p>
<p>Planners are also running the final tests on a phone navigation app developed by Honeywell specifically for the Super Bowl. It will give turn-by-turn directions along the core skyway routes. </p>
<p>One ongoing skyway issue is a lack of consistency in operating hours. Each skyway is controlled by a specific building owner, and there are more than 60 different skyway owners along the entire system. They don’t always observe the same opening and closing hours. </p>
<p>Cramer said the Super Bowl committee is working with the various owners to negotiate uniform operating hours during the Super Bowl festivities. Skyways will stay open later than usual, he said, but there’s no final agreement yet on the time. </p>
<p>Kristen Montag, a communications manager for the tourism group Meet Minneapolis, expects that Super Bowl visitors will like their skyway experience, much as other visitors already do. </p>
<p>“The majority of feedback we get is positive,” she said. “People think they’re cool and unique. And because there are so many amenities in the skyway, people are intrigued by this whole other life that happens in our city.” </p>
<p>But the skyways aren’t for everyone. Mark Hughes of Shoreview, rolling down the Nicollet Mall in his wheelchair, said he actually finds the city sidewalks easier to navigate. His friend, Elisa Axiotis, said being outside is part of being Minnesotan. </p>
<p>“In the winter, you get all bundled up and then if you go in the skyway you have to take it off,” she said. “As long as you’re from Minnesota, you might as well enjoy the weather.” </p>

                                    </div>
<p>Before Gaye Sundberg died in 2014, she dreamed that one day her husband, World War II veteran Wayne Sundberg, would receive the Purple Heart medal he had clearly earned. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, on their 60th wedding anniversary, Sundberg, now 93, did just that. </p>
<p>In 1944, Staff Sgt. Sundberg, a B-26 turret gunner from Milaca, Minn., was shot down and captured by German forces, suffering shrapnel wounds in the ordeal, then was held as a prisoner of war for nine months before being liberated by Soviet troops at the end of the war. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., whose office helped Sundberg’s family secure the medal, pinned it on him at a ceremony at the Veterans Services Building in St. Paul, according to media reports. </p>
<p>“Wayne, like most soldiers, didn’t serve for the accolades or the attention,” Klobuchar said at the ceremony. “He didn’t stick around the base waiting for his Purple Heart to be awarded. He just went home to Minnesota.” </p>
<p>Sundberg’s son, Mark Sundberg, said that as his father was being discharged, he was told that he was entitled to the medal but would need to wait a couple of days for the paperwork. </p>
<p>“We knew he was a POW and had been hurt in the war, but he never got the medal,” Mark Sundberg said. “We had no proof he was wounded in combat. We had no way to verify he deserved the medal.” </p>
<p>Wayne and Gaye Sundberg lived for many years in Edina. Gaye died in 2014; Wayne now lives in Minneapolis. After they retired, Gaye started to look into her husband’s service history and found that Wayne’s military records had been destroyed in a 1973 fire. </p>
<p>After his mother died, Mark Sundberg, a high school teacher who lives in Ramsey, went looking through his father’s memorabilia. That’s when he found an old POW identification card written in German, which also said that Sundberg had been wounded. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, more than 72 years after the war ended, the old veteran, flanked by several generations of Sundbergs, finally received his Purple Heart. “To him, what matters most is that this was something my mom wanted,” said his proud son. </p>

<p>Kids across Minneapolis are playing badminton without racquets and sharing the same jersey number at soccer games. They’re piling into Grandma’s minivan to get to practice or games across town. </p>
<p>For the city’s thousands of teens, school sports have become a do-it-yourself effort as the effect of back-to-back budget deficits shows up at Minneapolis Public Schools’ fields, courts and swimming pools. Cutbacks are coming right in the middle of sports seasons and prompting unease as next school year’s $33 million deficit looms. </p>
<p>“People had to rely on parents and coordinate,” said Emma Schluter, a Minneapolis South High School senior and soccer captain. “It’s definitely something that became much more of an issue for ourselves, rather than the school district supporting us.” </p>
<p>This year, every high school lost a football and volleyball coach. Parents tick off the problems their kids are facing: too few uniforms, buses and coaches. </p>
<p>Middle school sports have also been slashed. Schools are left to grapple with the fallout from a 14 percent cut to athletic funding last year and pinched athletic finances for the past few years. They expect to dip into carry-over funds to match expenses. </p>

<p>The district reports it isn’t seeing some of the parents’ examples of cutbacks. Shortages arose because of several factors, including budget tightening, said student support services executive director Keith Brooks. </p>
<p>Donovann Bower, a sophomore at Roosevelt High School, said his junior varsity soccer team played with mismatched jerseys this year. With money tight, the school prioritizes the varsity team, he said. His mother, Jeanette Bower, plans annual car washes to help kids earn money for sweatshirts. </p>
<p>“If I can, as a parent, raise money for my kids on the side to provide things that the school can’t provide, then I’m going to do everything I can do to raise that money,” Bower said. </p>
<p>Athletes like senior Maddy Tennant, the other South High School soccer captain, feel the financial disparities when playing suburban competitors on their fields. In the suburbs athletes often have better stadiums, and some have had access to competitive sports since they were much younger. </p>
<p>“I wonder how much better we would be if we had the same resources,” Tennant said. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Looming budget concerns</strong></h3>
<p>This year, Edison High School had to turn away soccer players because it couldn’t afford a third boys’ coach. These and other shortages have prompted parents such as Greg Oliver to point to what they call inequity issues. </p>
<p>While district athletic officials say every high school gets the same funding for coaches per sport, schools can build on that amount through a combination of student participation fees, gate fees and grant funds. Schools with winning teams, wide community support and the facilities to host evening games can raise extra money that can pay for extra coaches and sports supplies. </p>
<p>In response to complaints about “haves and have-nots,” the school board directed the district to study the differences in sports funding and present its results in the coming months. District athletics officials said they have heard comments about fairness. </p>
<p>“When kids have fewer opportunities when they’re young, we see the results in the classroom and we see the results on our high school teams,” said board treasurer Jenny Arneson at a fall board meeting. Arneson has championed the study. </p>
<p>The revenue numbers can be examined in different ways, yet disparities show up each time. </p>
<p>For example, Washburn High School will make more than double the North Side schools when total revenue is considered. But that changes when the number of student athletes is factored in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><style type="text/css">.embed iframe{height:400px;} @media only screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 767px){.embed iframe {height:425px;}}</style></p>
<div><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="400" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wcPBU/2/" width="100%"></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>A Star Tribune analysis of projected per-student athlete revenue at high schools shows that two of the poorest schools, North and Roosevelt, will bring in the most per-student money, thanks in part to low student participation numbers. Roosevelt also benefits from evening games on its lighted field, and Minneapolis North High School enjoys strong ticket sales with its string of recent state championships in football and basketball. </p>
<p>The higher household incomes on the South Side make it easier for families to raise money to supplement what the district can provide. But that prompts more parent questions: Is it fair that wealthier schools can raise outside funds to plug budget gaps? Should the district pool all schools’ revenue, carrying money from revenue-rich schools to those with less? </p>
<p>This kind of variation is inevitable, the school district says. Yet parents districtwide say sports are critical to keeping kids in school. </p>
<p>Sports have “a huge impact” on academic success, too, said district athletic director Trent Tucker. That’s why Minneapolis district policy states that all students can play, regardless of their ability to pay the participation fee — generally $60 per sport, though reduced if a student qualifies for lunch subsidies. </p>
<p>“The beauty of athletics is that it coincides with academics,” Tucker said. “Those two are like a marriage.” </p>

<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Uncertain futures</strong></h3>
<p>What lies ahead for athletics is unclear as Superintendent Ed Graff and Minneapolis officials figure out what will go to fix next year’s budget deficit. </p>
<p>“We have a grand opportunity in terms of our $33 million deficit to look at our core values as a district and look holistically at the students,” Brooks said. </p>
<p>The thought of more cuts to already slim programs makes parents uneasy. South High soccer parent Scott Schluter said students are picking up on the budget cuts. </p>
<p>“The ones that are older that are aware of it feel frustrated that they don’t know exactly what’s going to happen,” Schluter said. </p>
<p>At Southwest High School, Jeanne Erickson Cooley drove students on the C and junior varsity baseball teams to games last year — though her own son played on the varsity team. If the district’s financial troubles force more cuts, she said she’s not sure what more the parents can do. </p>
<p>“Teenagers — it’s so freaking hard for them,” she said. “This is the thing that kept my kids going.” </p>

<p>Decades ago, Richfield police took a risk, becoming one of the first five law enforcement agencies in Minnesota to assign officers to 12-hour shifts. </p>
<p>With the lengthy shifts came impressive payoffs — a calendar filled with more time off, including three- or four-day breaks to catch up on sleep, help out at home or socialize. </p>
<p>“We’ve been doing it for 25 years now,” said Deputy Chief Mike Koob of the Richfield Police Department. “I think we’d have a revolt if we ever went back.” </p>
<p>Over the past 10 to 15 years, other Minnesota police departments slowly began making the switch to longer shifts over fewer days. </p>
<p>Inver Grove Heights, Blaine, Lakeville and Ramsey police went to 12-hour shifts in the past six years. Hastings cops will do so next year. </p>
<p>“It’s becoming more commonplace in law enforcement,” said Lt. Brian Tholen of the Edina Police Department. “It’s nice to have the time for officers to go home and spend quality time with their family.” </p>

<p>No one tracks police schedules statewide. An informal phone survey found metro-area departments divided between 10- and 12-hour schedules, though some have hybrid shifts. West St. Paul police work a 9½-hour schedule. Cottage Grove will shift from 10½ hours to 11 hours next year. </p>
<p>In Minneapolis, officers work either eight or 10 hours, depending on their job. St. Paul police put in 10-hour shifts. </p>
<p>Most police officials say the officers prefer the arrangement over a conventional eight-hour day, citing improved mental health, increased productivity and more coverage during peak times. </p>
<p>But not everyone is a fan. Lurking behind its appeal are worries about fatigue, which some studies and sleep experts say could hamper judgment or lead to accidents in a profession with high stakes. </p>
<p>“The longer you work, the more it’s going to impact your potential sleep,” said Dr. Michael Howell, a University of Minnesota neurologist. “For police officers, the question is also life and death.” </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Research results mixed</strong></h3>
<p>The Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association and Law Enforcement Labor Services — Minnesota’s largest police union — have taken no position on the issue. Schedules don’t usually affect contract negotiations, union officials said. </p>
<p>Duty rotations can be complex and vary by department. </p>
<p>A 550-page, three-ring binder filled with sample schedules sits on the desk of Capt. Greg Rinzel of the Cottage Grove Police Department, demonstrating how many options exist. “It’s been studied almost to the point of nauseam,” Rinzel said. </p>
<p>Research has reached mixed conclusions. A 2011 study by the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research organization, compared experiences of officers in Detroit and Arlington, Texas, who were randomly assigned eight-, 10- and 12-hour shifts. The study found that officers working 10 hours performed better on measurable tasks. Those working 12 hours said they were sleepier and less alert at work than those working eight hours. Even so, the authors found that the longer schedules “do not raise significant concerns.” </p>
<p>A study published in 2008 by Police Chief magazine (the International Association of Chiefs of Police periodical) examined the results when part of the Lincoln Police Department in Nebraska switched to 12-hour shifts. Most measures, from productivity to discipline rates, remained the same. Every officer preferred the longer schedule, and the study concluded that 12-hour shifts were a “viable scheduling alternative.” </p>
<p>Yet while all of the officers said they could perform under the schedule, 13 percent acknowledged there had been times when they couldn’t function safely. </p>
<p>That’s what concerns Chief Bud Shaver in West St. Paul. </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t consider going to a 12-hour shift,” Shaver said. “After an extended work period, an officer’s work performance and decision-making skills tend to diminish.” </p>
<p>There are other snags. Court days can become complicated, especially when an officer works 12 hours, gets off at 6 a.m., and has court the next morning or afternoon. “Your sleep gets broken up,” said Sgt. Jeff Warner of the Blaine Police Department. </p>
<p>Officials said long shifts mean that on workdays, officers must accept that there’s only time for work and sleep. </p>
<h3><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Work-life balance</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly everyone interviewed by the Star Tribune said that while there are downsides, the pluses of longer shifts outweigh the minuses. Officials from eight departments said they don’t believe their schedule results in overtired officers. Many said they monitor the issue. </p>
<p>Before Elk River police debuted 12-hour shifts in 2004, Chief Ron Nierenhausen said skeptics predicted that officers would take more sick days and be less productive. That didn’t happen, he said. </p>
<p>Nierenhausen said officers are polled yearly about the schedules, and they opt to stay with 12-hour shifts. </p>
<p>Longer shifts mean more officers on the street when they’re needed, said South St. Paul Chief William Messerich, whose department started the arrangement in 2005. He said other shift schedules sometimes resulted in officers doubled up in squad cars unnecessarily. The 12-hour shifts make it easier for most officers to achieve a good work-life balance, Messerich said. </p>
<p>“There have certainly been officers that have difficulty with their 12-hour shifts,” Messerich said. “It balances out though — an off day is just around the corner.” </p>
<p>The Inver Grove Heights City Council heard a presentation by then-Interim Chief Sean Folmar in early December summarizing the department’s first year with 12-hour shifts. Folmar listed benefits of the system, including boosted morale, having a supervisor on duty 24 hours a day and more efficient training because the department can train in two days instead spreading it over five days as before. </p>
<p>Residents have asked if the department hired more officers, noting they’re more visible now, Folmar said. </p>
<p>Officer-initiated activities — checking on suspicious cars, traffic stops, patrolling crime hot spots — are up 144 percent to 8,959 in 2017 from 3,671 in 2016. Folmar said the only drawback is that officers use less vacation time. </p>
<p>Police officials caution that what works for one department might prove ineffective elsewhere, depending on department size, call volumes and organizational culture. </p>
<p>“Every city is unique,” said Sean Gormley, Law Enforcement Labor Services’ executive director. “Once an agency finds something that works, it’s hard to break that up.” </p>

<p>Overheard in the Dallas Stars’ locker room before the game, here was center Tyler Seguin’s assessment of facing the Wild: “Both teams wear green.” </p>
<p>He’s not wrong. </p>
<p>Turns out, there were a few more differences than similarities Wednesday when the Wild turned in a confident 4-2 victory at Xcel Energy Center in front of an announced crowd of 19,107. That’s a bit of a twist, considering the exact tint of Dallas’ color is “victory” green. </p>
<p>The Wild improved to 19-15-3 while the Stars fell to 20-15-3 — just two points ahead of Minnesota — in the stacked Central Division. </p>
<p>“Well, I mean, I didn’t want to talk about it being a huge game, but it was a huge game,” Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. “We called it the start of the second half [of the season]. So you get a chance to reset. And I likened it this morning to a game of golf here. You play the first nine holes and probably are not as happy as you’d like to be. But you can always make it up on the back nine. I mean, it was only one game, but it was a good divisional start.” </p>

<p>Seguin started off his team’s scoring with 12 minutes, 37 seconds remaining in the first period, redirecting defenseman Esa Lindell’s shot past Wild goaltender Alex Stalock. Wild defenseman Jared Spurgeon tied the score with less than a minute to go in the period, burying a rebound from winger Charlie Coyle’s initial shot. </p>
<p>While it took both teams most of that first period to shake off their three-day holiday break, the action picked up in the second 20 minutes. On an odd-man rush, Wild center Eric Staal scored at 5:12 thanks to an inadvertent assist from Stars defenseman Greg Pateryn. Wild defenseman Matt Dumba then tried to draw unlucky Pateryn into the celebration, which did not go over well. </p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, I was not paying attention, but I saw a couple fists coming in,” winger Tyler Ennis said of Dumba’s move. “But, no, it was a good goal and a great game.” </p>
<p>Stars winger Mattias Janmark scored 10 seconds into a power-play about halfway through the second period when a wide shot from Seguin bounced off the boards and right to him. But the Wild returned the favor with a 10-second power-play goal of its own at 13:08 by winger Mikael Granlund, making it 3-2 Wild. </p>
<p>Spurgeon looked to have scored his second goal of the night with a wraparound buzzer-beater, but the officials ruled that time had expired. </p>
<p>The third period was scoreless until Wild winger Jason Zucker got an empty-net goal in the last minute. </p>
<p>Before the game, Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said it would be interesting to see how his team responded to a weird day of travel after the time off as well as a different take on the morning skate and team meetings because of it. </p>
<p>He also worried about how his team would emotionally connect after the break, especially since he said there is “no gray area” to the Stars, as they either play exactly like they should or are completely hapless. Wednesday, it was the latter. </p>
<p>“It was our poorest effort by a mile,” Hitchcock said. “We were light everywhere. Light on the puck. Light around our net. Light around their net. This looked like the way we played a month and a half ago.” </p>
<p>For the Wild, it was the opposite. </p>
<p>“You could tell we had a bit more confidence tonight,” Spurgeon said. “Guys were handling the puck, and I thought all lines were going as well. Everyone was clicking, and there wasn’t one person that wasn’t doing the job they were supposed to. </p>
<p>“We know the position we’re in and how big the second half is for us,” Spurgeon said. “We’re going to have to win a lot of games for the playoff push, and that’s what we’re trying to start off with right now.” </p>

<p>Wednesday morning the Timberwolves revealed their fourth uniform. Called the &#8220;City Edition,&#8221; it is mainly gray. After Wednesday night&#8217;s game against Denver, the team should consider a fifth. Called the &#8220;Jimmy Butler Edition,&#8221; it would feature a cape. </p>
<p>He did it again. </p>
<p>After 2½ quarters of beautiful basketball — and an 18-point Wolves lead — had degenerated into a do-or-die overtime, Butler scored 12 of Minnesota&#8217;s 14 points in overtime, dishing the ball to Jamal Crawford for the ultimate game-winner in a 128-125 victory over the Nuggets that pushed Minnesota&#8217;s winning streak to five games. </p>
<p>Superman struck again. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been saying this all year,&#8221; Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said after it was over. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping everyone is recognizing how special he is. He&#8217;s changed everything for us. Big play after big play, guards everyone. Hustle plays. Tough rebounds. Everything.&#8221; </p>
<p>That about sums it up. </p>

                  Timberwolves guard Jimmy Butler attempted a three-pointer but was fouled by Nuggets guard Torrey Craig in the second quarter. Butler finished with a game-high 39 points in the Wolves&#8217; 128-125 victory in overtime at Target Center.

<p></p>
<p>Butler had 39 points, with 12 coming in the 5-minute overtime, seven of them from the line. He also got two huge overtime rebounds and the game-winning assist. </p>
<p>&#8220;Thibs, all the coaches, my teammates, they told me to keep going,&#8221; Butler said. &#8220;I was really, really locked in. That&#8217;s the scary part about it.&#8221; </p>
<p>He did it with Karl-Anthony Towns (14 points, 13 rebounds) having fouled out in the fourth quarter, with Taj Gibson (20 points) fouled out in the first minute in overtime, and with starting point guard Jeff Teague (11 points, 10 assists) out because of an injured left knee that will undergo an MRI Thursday. Butler did it after the Wolves had squandered a 19-point first-half lead, an 18-point lead with 4 minutes to go in the third quarter and a nine-point lead with 2:50 left in regulation. </p>
<p>Denver&#8217;s Will Barton (28 points) had forced overtime with two free throws with 5.5 seconds left. </p>
<p>Butler decided his team wouldn&#8217;t lose. </p>
<p>&#8220;He just imposed his will,&#8221; Crawford said. &#8220;He really did. He literally willed us.&#8221; </p>
<p>And all after Gary Harris&#8217; three-pointer to open the OT gave Denver its biggest lead (three) of the game. </p>
<p>Butler hit two free throws with 4:12 left. After Nikola Jokic (22 points) scored, Butler was fouled on a three-point attempt and made two. After Trey Lyles&#8217; dunk, Butler&#8217;s two free throws with 1:46 left tied the score. </p>
<p>At the other end Butler grabbed the rebound of Jokic&#8217;s miss, then scored on a 14-footer. Two Jokic free throws with 1:06 left tied the score for the last time, then Butler got the ball to Crawford for what turned out to be the game-winner. </p>
<p>He was going to shoot, he said. But Crawford, open, kept yelling his name. </p>
<p>&#8220;I really was going to shoot,&#8221; Butler said. &#8220;But if Jamal screams, &#8216;Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy,&#8217; that means he&#8217;s open. He did what he&#8217;s done for us all year. He made the shot.&#8221; </p>
<p>With the sellout crowd of 18,978 chanting MVP, Butler hit one free throw with 16.9 seconds left to finish the scoring. </p>
<p>This has been Butler&#8217;s habit this month, during which he has scored 30 or more points in 13 December games. Thibodeau, who coached Butler in Chicago, said he believes Butler is playing the best ball of his career. </p>
<p>Wednesday he simply leapt a tall opponent in a single bound. Bring on the cape. </p>
<p>&#8220;When his best is needed, he&#8217;s always at his best,&#8221; Thibodeau said. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Democrat Doug Jones&#8217; historic victory over Republican Roy Moore was declared official Thursday as Alabama election officials certified him the winner of the special Senate election, despite Moore&#8217;s last-minute lawsuit claiming voter fraud. </p>
<p>Jones defeated Moore on Dec. 12 by 21,924 votes in a stunning victory in a traditionally red state, becoming the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate victory in a quarter-century. The win came after Moore, best known for stands against gay marriage and the public display of the Ten Commandments, was dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls that occurred decades ago. </p>
<p>Jones said in a statement that he looked forward to going to work for the people of Alabama in the new year. </p>
<p>&#8220;As I said on election night, our victory marks a new chapter for our state and the nation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will be an independent voice and work to find common ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get Washington back on track and fight to make our country a better place for all.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jones will be sworn in on Jan. 3, narrowing the GOP&#8217;s advantage in the U.S. Senate to 51-49. He takes over the seat previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. </p>
<p>In a brief meeting Thursday at the Alabama Capitol, the governor, attorney general and secretary of state signed paperwork certifying the final ballot numbers. It was a quiet punctuation mark to a tumultuous election marked by the misconduct accusations and Moore&#8217;s eleventh-hour legal fight. </p>
<p>Moore had refused to concede his loss to Jones and filed a last-ditch lawsuit hours before the certification, saying he believed there were voting irregularities that should be investigated. A judge denied his request to stop the election certification. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said his office has so far found no evidence of fraud. </p>
<p>In a brief statement, Moore stood by his claims that the election was fraudulent and said he had to fight Democrats and over $50 million in opposition spending from the Washington establishment. He said he had no regrets. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have stood for the truth about God and the Constitution for the people of Alabama,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>On election night, Moore had pegged his hopes on votes from military serviceman and provisional ballots. The official numbers certified Thursday showed that Jones slightly expanded his lead over Moore. Jones had a lead of 20,715 in the unofficial returns and was ahead 21,924 in the certified result. In all, more than 1.3 million people voted in the special election, including 22,850 write-in votes. </p>
<p>Jones is a former U.S. attorney best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for Birmingham&#8217;s infamous 1963 church bombing. </p>
<p>As he launched his campaign, he said he saw an opening for a rare Democratic win against Moore, a polarizing figure in the state. Moore was a twice removed from the position of chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Once was for defying a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. And he was permanently suspended last year for urging probate judges to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples in defiance of federal court rulings. </p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s campaign was deeply wounded by the sexual misconduct accusations. Moore denied the accusations and said in the lawsuit that he had passed a polygraph test to prove they are false. </p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s attorney wrote in the wide-ranging complaint that he believed there were irregularities during the election, including that voters may have been brought in from other states. He attached a statement from a poll worker that she had noticed licenses from Georgia and North Carolina as people signed in to vote. The complaint also noted the higher-than-expected turnout in the race, particularly in Jefferson County. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a Republican or Democrat issue as election integrity should matter to everyone,&#8221; Moore said in a statement Wednesday. </p>
<p>Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, said Moore&#8217;s complaint did not raise the sort of issues that lead courts to overturn an election. He said Moore&#8217;s complaint might just be a way for him to fundraise and throw &#8220;red meat to his loyal supporters.&#8221; </p>
<p>Merrill said Moore has a few options left, such as offering to pay for a recount within 48 hours. </p>
<p>&#8220;I can say this. I don&#8217;t think there is any doubt from the minds of anybody that&#8217;s in the room that if there was ever a question about whether Alabama conducts honest, fair election safe and secure elections, that question has been eliminated,&#8221; Merrill said. </p>

<div><img alt="" src="http://stmedia.startribune.com/images/1514470251_08-03commute122917.pix.jpg"></div>
<p>A light covering of snow was all it took to turn Thursday&#8217;s morning commute into a slippery drive as slick roads led to scores of crashes and spinouts. </p>
<p>At 8:30 a.m., more than 30 incidents snarled traffic, including a car vs. semitrailer truck crash on northbound I-35W at County Road I in Mounds View. Between 5 and 8 a.m., MnDOT&#8217;s traveler information site <a href="http://www.511mn.org/">511mn.org</a> has listed more than 50 crashes or spin outs.</p>
<p>It was not the amount of snow, less than an inch in most places across the metro, but temperatures hovering around zero made for treacherous driving. </p>
<p>MnDOT has warned drivers early this morning to expect a much slower commute as chemicals are not as effective when temperatures sink to zero or below. </p>
<p>&#8220;Plows out in metro clearing snow, dropping salt,&#8221; MnDOT spokesman Kevin Gutknecht said in a tweet before the commute got started. &#8220;Temps may create slick spots. Take it slow this a.m., arrive dent free.&#8221; </p>
<p>The agency issued the usual advice: Keep the speeds down. MnDOT also reminded drivers to clear the snow off of headlights and tail lights before putting their car in drive. </p>
<p>Hennepin County has 71 plows out clearing snow and laying anti-icing materials on county roads. </p>
<p>By 6 a.m. snow totals were 0.4 inches in St. Cloud and at the weather service&#8217;s offices in Chanhassen, and 0.2 inches at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. </p>
<p>Behind the snow, another surge of bitterly cold air will arrive Thursday night and persist into Monday, the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>Windchill readings are forecast to reach -30 degrees in the metro area Saturday morning and -22 degrees on Sunday morning. </p>
<p>&#8220;Frostbite can set in in as little as 15 minutes on any exposed skin with wind chills of 25 below or colder,&#8221; the weather service warned. And that is the situation most of Minnesota will face . </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">The Vikings should dismiss Dead Bears Walking as easily as they swatted aside Dead Bengals Walking at home a couple of weeks ago.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Mark Craig</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23124558/tdcelebration.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13344" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23124558/tdcelebration.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Week 17 is never an easy week to pick NFL games. (As if any week is, eh?) </p>
<p>Teams with nothing to play for typically play that way. So, with that in mind, do you take, for example, an eight-win Cowboys team and give 2 1/2 points at Philadelphia, where the Eagles have 13 wins and homefield advantage in the NFC locked up? </p>
<p>I suppose the Eagles will rest some players. But how much? This is, after all, a team that lost its franchise quarterback three weeks ago. So you also have to consider the momentum factor heading into the playoffs while trying to gauge how the Eagles will treat Sunday’s game. </p>
<p>Jacksonville-Tennessee is another intriguing line. Jacksonville, which has 10 wins and a division title, is getting 6 1/2 points at Tennessee, which has eight wins, but has lost three straight and four of six. Yes, Tennessee is playing for its playoff life, but Jacksonville also is coming off a 44-33 loss to the 49ers. </p>
<p>The Week 16 picks didn’t prove to be all that tough last week. (Although no money was placed where mouth was). The picks here went 12-4 straight-up and 11-5 against the spread. The Upset Not-So-Special dropped to 3-12 on the season when the Raiders didn’t beat the Eagles. Give me Jags over Titans this week. You’re welcome, Tennessee. </p>
<p>I sorta missed on the Patriots. Said they’d win by 20 and they won by 21. This week, as 15 ½-point favorites against the Jets, I’m going to say New England by 28. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, the Browns aren’t the biggest underdog on the board. (Hey, baby steps, Cleveland. Baby steps). They’re getting 13 1/2 at Pittsburgh. I’ll say Steelers by 21 as the Brownies match the 2008 Lions as the only 0-16 teams in NFL history. </p>
<p>As for the Vikings, well, let’s just say they won’t be giving John Fox the same coaching sendoff that the Bears gave Mike Tice back in 2005. </p>
<p>Here are this week’s games … </p>
<p><strong>Bears plus-12 1/2 at Vikings: </strong>Vikings 37, Bears 10</p>
<p>The Vikings should dismiss Dead Bears Walking as easily as they swatted aside Dead Bengals Walking at home a couple of weeks ago. The most likely wrench to be thrown into this scenario would be early sloppiness on the part of the Vikings’ No. 2-ranked run defense. If Jordan Howard, the NFL’s fifth-leading rusher, gets going, the Bears might gain interest in the game. Throw in a few unexpected turnovers and some drive-killing penalties, and the Vikings could lose. But don’t bet on it. I’d give the 12 ½ points. </p>
<p><strong>Cowboys minus-2 1/2 at Eagles:</strong> Cowboys by 3</p>
<p><strong>Redskins minus-3 1/2 at Giants: </strong>Redskins by 7</p>
<p><strong>Packers plus-7 1/2 at Lions: </strong>Lions by 10</p>
<p><strong>Browns plus-13 1/2 at Steelers:</strong> Steelers by 21</p>
<p><strong>Texans plus-4 1/2 at Colts: </strong>Colts by 7</p>
<p><strong>Jets plus-15 1/2 at Patriots: </strong>Patriots by 28</p>
<p><strong>Bengals plus-9 1/2 at Ravens: </strong>Ravens by 3</p>
<p><strong>Cardinals plus-7 1/2 at Seahawks: </strong>Seahawks by 9</p>
<p><strong>Chiefs plus-3 1/2 at Broncos: </strong>Chiefs by 7</p>
<p><strong>Raiders plus-8 1/2 at Chargers: </strong>Chargers by 14</p>
<p><strong>Saints minus-7 1/2 at Buccaneers: </strong>Saints by 14</p>
<p><strong>Panthers plus-3 1/2 at Falcons: </strong>Panthers by 7</p>
<p><strong>49ers plus-4 1/2 at Rams: </strong>Rams by 3</p>
<p><strong> Bills minus-2 1/2 at Dolphins: </strong>Dolphins by 3</p>
<p><strong>UPSET SPECIAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jaguars plus-6 1/2 at Titans: </strong>Jaguars 24, Titans 14</p>
<p>Yeah, the Titans have more to play for. A win and they’re in the playoffs. But they’ve had things to play for the past three weeks and have lost each game. They lost to Arizona and the 49ers. The Jaguars already own a playoff berth and a division title. But they’re also going to want to regain some momentum from giving up 44 points in a loss to the 49ers last week. </p>
<p><strong>Last week straight up; versus spread:</strong> 12-4; 11-5</p>
<p><strong>Year to date:</strong> 155-83; 115-124</p>
<p><strong>Upset specials: </strong>3-13</p>
<p><strong>Record picking Vikings games: </strong>10-5</p>

South Korea&#8217;s Kospi surged 1.3 percent after government data showed strong gains in retail sales and industrial output last month. Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent.

<p>The photo shows a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/imagery-and-data">“cloud streets”</a> that stretched across the Great Lakes region on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>“These parallel rows of clouds, known as ‘cloud streets’ streaming over the Great Lakes on Christmas Day 2017 … helped deliver record-setting snowfall in Erie, Pa., where more than 60 inches of snow fell over a two-day period.” </p>
<p>Strong westerly winds over Lake Erie picked up moisture, developed into snow and converged with opposing winds, dumping snow in a band along the shore from Ohio to New York, said Zach Sefcovic, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Cleveland. </p>
<p>Sabrina Ram drove into Erie on Christmas Eve to visit her parents just as the snow began to fall. Ram, who lives in suburban Washington, D.C., and her father spent five hours on Christmas and two hours on Tuesday clearing the driveway. </p>
<p>&#8220;In D.C., we&#8217;d be out of commission for weeks,&#8221; Ram said. &#8220;Things here are pretty much back to normal now.&#8221; </p>
<p>In New York, communities near Lake Ontario&#8217;s eastern end, including Redfield and Boylston, also saw around 5 feet of snow this week. </p>
<p>Officials said the storm&#8217;s timing was good, since people were off the streets and staying home for Christmas, giving plows more space to clear streets. </p>
<p>By Wednesday, Erie&#8217;s roads were relatively clear, emergency calls were relatively slow and the big task was digging out, County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re used to a lot of snow here in Erie, but this is unprecedented, the amount we got,&#8221; Dahlkemper said. </p>

<p>Not waiting to capture their suspect, authorities have charged a Burnsville man with abducting his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint outside her Minnetonka workplace and fleeing. </p>
<p>Jahon K. Douglas, 37, of Burnsville, was charged Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court with kidnapping, assault with a dangerous weapon and first-degree robbery in connection with the abduction of Nicole Smith, also 37, of Anoka. </p>
<p>Smith had been missing since Dec. 21, when she was seen being kidnapped outside her workplace on Bren Road about 4 p.m., according to police. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Smith persuaded Douglas to let her go, and she returned to her parents’ home in Anoka in Douglas’ car that afternoon, police said Thursday afternoon. She was physically unharmed. </p>
<p>“Our officers continue to work diligently to locate Jahon Douglas,” Police Chief Scott Boerboom said in a statement. “We are working closely with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate any information that could lead to his whereabouts.” </p>
<p>Police have declined to disclose her whereabouts while she was missing or how she persuaded Douglas to release her. </p>
<p>For the first time since the abduction a week ago, police on Thursday released a description of Douglas. He is black, 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair. </p>
<p>The pair have had a history of domestic turmoil, police said. She told police that Douglas planned to kill her and then himself, the criminal complaint read. </p>
<p>A week ago Thursday, Smith and a co-worker got in a car outside Minneapolis Mart, a showroom facility for wholesale home decor on Bren, just northwest of where Hwys. 212 and 62 meet. </p>
<p>Douglas climbed in the back seat, pointed a gun at the co-worker’s head and said to start driving. Douglas then pointed the gun at Smith and “threatened to blow her head off,” the charges read. </p>
<p>Smith got out of the car, and Douglas followed and forced her into his car, the complaint continued. </p>
<p>Police have yet to recover a weapon and said he should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information on Douglas’ location is asked to call 911. </p>
<p>Douglas’ criminal history in Minnesota spans his adult life and includes two cases that are active in Anoka County: one filed in October alleging that he fled police while driving drunk and possessing marijuana, and the other filed a week earlier on charges of fleeing police and threatening violence. </p>
<p>He’s been convicted three times in the state for assault, four times for illicit drug crimes, twice for drunken driving, once each for violating a court order for protection, property damage and disorderly conduct, and more than 20 times for driving after having license revoked. </p>

<p>Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been named the organization&#8217;s general manager, in addition to receiving a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday. </p>
<p>Reeve has led the Lynx to four WNBA titles in eight seasons. She was recently named the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports-person-of-the-year-cheryl-reeve-lynx-s-transformer-in-chief/466321813/">Star Tribune&#8217;s Sportsperson of the Year</a>. </p>
<p>Reeve has a 195-77 record. Her promotion to GM makes her the sixth coach in the WNBA to hold the dual roles. </p>
<p>The Lynx made a number of other organizational moves on Thursday, as well. </p>
<p>Claire Duwelius, who held the role of basketball operations manager, is the now assistant general manager. Lynx assistant coaches Shelley Patterson and Walt Hopkins have agreed to contract extensions. Assistant coach James Wade remains on the staff. </p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate Glen Taylor&#8217;s confidence in me to continue to lead the Lynx organization,&#8221; Reeve said. &#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled with the strong and passionate staff we&#8217;ve assembled and look forward to the challenges that lie ahead.&#8221; </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Smith is leaving the DMC board to take over the U.S. Senate seat now held by Al Franken.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Matt McKinney</h4>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tina Smith resigned Thursday as chairwoman of the board of directors for Mayo Clinic’s $5.6 billion expansion, known as Destination Medical Center (DMC). </p>
<p>Smith, who has served as the board’s chairwoman since its inception in 2013, submitted her resignation in letters to Gov. Mark Dayton and DMC directors. Smith was appointed by Dayton earlier this month to take over the U.S. Senate seat now occupied by Al Franken. </p>
<p>Former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, the vice chair, will take over as interim chair. </p>
<p>The DMC project, which blends private investment with public money to fuel growth over 20 years, originally was pitched as a needed step to keep Mayo competitive with other world-class medical centers. </p>
<p>Mayo will expand its campus and extend its medical know-how with $3.5 billion in investments over the course of DMC’s life span, while private investors are expected to add another $2.1 billion in residential, retail and commercial investments. About $585 million in tax money will build the public infrastructure necessary to tie it all together. </p>
<p>The plan calls for adding more than 30,000 jobs in Rochester, adding tens of thousands of people to the city’s population and generating billions in tax revenue. </p>
<p>The expansion took off in earnest last year with multiple construction projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Some 14 construction projects worth an estimated $736.8 million are either planned or in the works or have recently been completed in the roughly 550-acre zone delineated for renovations and new construction. </p>
<p>“I am proud of the work we accomplished together, and am confident that under your leadership DMC can continue to move ahead,” Smith wrote in a letter to the board of directors. “During the past four years we have made significant progress &#8230; </p>
<p>“These accomplishments are a testament to the leadership of this board and the hard work and ingenuity of the people of Rochester who made this city a global health care destination.” </p>
<p>In a statement Thursday, Dayton called Smith a “tremendous champion” for the DMC expansion, adding that she “has been crucial to the project’s successes.” </p>

<h3>Kenneth Tam: Cold Open </h3>
<p>The Minneapolis Institute of Art quietly unveiled these <a href="https://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/kenneth-tam/">three video works</a> on the Saturday before Christmas. In &#8220;The compression is not subservient to the explosion; it gives it increased force&#8221; (2011), the New York artist orchestrates a relationship between himself and a man he met online — except the man is inside a cardboard box, with holes carved for his arms. The viewer never sees him. Together they negotiate boundaries and consent, two types of conversations we don&#8217;t usually see played out between men (sexual or otherwise). In &#8220;sump&#8221; (2015), Tam and his father play with created rituals, from painting circles on each other&#8217;s bellies to blowing up balloons. Their shared physicality reveals more about their relationship than dialogue could. &#8220;Breakfast in Bed&#8221; (2016), a 32-minute video that only screens on Thursday and Sundays, explores the group and performative dynamics of masculinity as a social construct. Tam will visit the museum for a talk at 6:30 p.m. Jan. 18 with curator Gabriel Ritter. (10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tue.-Wed. &amp; Sat.-Sun., 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Thu.-Fri. Ends April 8. 2400 3rd Av. S., Mpls. new.artsmia.org or 1-888-642-2787.)</p>

<p>There is almost nonstop verbal sparring between Saoirse Ronan as the cool-nerd title character, who&#8217;s eager to flee high school, California and everything else in her early life, and Laurie Metcalf as her strong-willed, deeply opinionated mom, a nurse working double shifts to keep the family afloat after her husband loses his job. To watch these imperfect, vexing, lovable women volley dialogue — &#8220;I want to go where culture is, like New York.&#8221; &#8220;How in the world did I raise such a snob?&#8221; — is a rare delight. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then find a seat where they&#8217;re screening <strong style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#8221;</strong> and buckle up for a bumpy, brilliant ride. Martin McDonagh&#8217;s small-town noir is perverse and hilarious in equal doses. Frances McDormand brings a spine of steel to her role as a single mother on a furious quest to locate the killer of her daughter, or at least to punish the local police for failing to find any suspects. Mostly strong-willed, partly kindhearted, always fuming like a blistering blast furnace, she is one woman you do not want to butt heads with.</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because you need a good cry-laugh &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Stories involving children and illness can be sugar-sweet and sentimental or manipulative sniffle-jerkers. None of that applies to Stephen Chbosky&#8217;s <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> &#8220;Wonder.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A kid-oriented family film, it gracefully navigates the chasm between adult drama with laughs, and young-adult fixations on mean kids, dating and popularity. As the parents of a 10-year-old boy with facial disfigurement, Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson do wonderfully nuanced work, going light on pathos and developing grown-up characters who have personalities and foibles of their own. </p>
<p>Jacob Tremblay is fine as the boy taking his first step out of home schooling as the ultimate outsider among his new private school classmates. He&#8217;s sensitive to the cruelties of his peers, but also science-prodigy smart, and a great friend to kids who don&#8217;t wall him out. </p>
<p>He&#8217;s also a total &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; nerd, which generates some funny fantasy-based appearances from a galaxy far, far away. So if you&#8217;re not all franchised out after &#8220;Star Wars: The Last Jedi,&#8221; there&#8217;s that. I told you this wasn&#8217;t a shameless weepie. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because Minnesotans love local connections however inconsequential &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;All the Money in the World&#8221;</strong> is an elegant thriller about the gruesome 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, the 16-year-old grandson and namesake of the world&#8217;s richest man. The oil tycoon was worth $2 billion — real money in those days — but refused to pay his grandson&#8217;s ransom for five months until he could dicker the captors down to a tax-deductible $2 million.</p>
<p>For all its abduction-procedural surface, the focus of the film is the corrupting influence of money, with Christopher Plummer as the Getty, Michelle Williams as the boy&#8217;s moneyless mother and Mark Wahlberg as the former CIA agent Getty dispatched to oversee the crisis. </p>
<p>Much of Ridley Scott&#8217;s drama is fact-based — Getty truly did install a coin-operated pay phone in his English mansion for guests to use — but it omits one key fact: Getty grew up in Minneapolis, where his father conducted a successful insurance and corporate law practice. He was born there in 1892 and called it home until 1904 when his father moved his wife and son to Oklahoma to begin a new career in the booming early days of the oil business. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">Because you just need a change of pace &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;Coco&#8221; </strong>pushes Pixar films into several new territories, with a Mexican setting, Latino stars, a sprinkling of Spanish dialogue presented without subtitles, and a musical score filled with original songs.</p>
<p>Want the recipe for a delicious Guillermo del Toro sorbet? <strong style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;The Shape of Water&#8221; </strong>puts love stories and the Creature From the Black Lagoon in a blender, adds a touch of song and dance, sex and spy thrillers, then tops it with a mesmerizing unspoken performance by Sally Hawkins that any silent screen star would envy.</p>
<p>How about a new take on a great old story? <strong style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;Darkest Hour&#8221;</strong> returns us to the early days of World War II, when unstoppable German troops were flooding west across Europe and toward Britain. Gary Oldman is witty, humane and downright amazing as Winston Churchill, weaponizing the English language and using it to rally and unite the country. It&#8217;s superb work, a career-best performance that is transformative in every way.</p>
<p>A heaping serving of new movies will begin inundating theaters next weekend. Meanwhile, enjoy these luscious leftovers. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>It didn’t feel like this on Jan. 1, did it? </p>
<p>But 360-something days later, 2017 has turned out to be the Unexpected Year of the Woman. </p>
<p>A shocker, yes. Because remember, 2016 was supposed to be the official, glass-shattering Year of the Woman. </p>
<p>Hillary Clinton made history as the first female major-party candidate for president. Air Force Gen. Lori Robinson became the first woman to head a U.S. combatant command. Kathryn Smith was hired as the first female NFL coach. American women did the job at the Olympics, clanking home with the majority of the country’s medals. Harriet Tubman was picked to replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Three women of color - a record number - were elected to the Senate. And at long last a woman, Samantha Bee, joined the dude-dominated lineup of late-night shows. </p>
<p>Then came the backlash. </p>
<p>Even though the majority of American voters elected a woman to the White House, the electoral college - a convoluted institution created by men - gave the presidency to a man with 2.8 million fewer votes. </p>
<p>And that man, Donald Trump, made a hobby of objectifying women, insulting women and openly bragging about grabbing women. And it felt as though 2017 might be the year that the massive boulder women have been pushing uphill for centuries rolled back down. </p>
<p>But no. It turned out to be the exact opposite, and, in a way, far more powerful than any of the milestones of 2016. </p>
<p>The year began with what was believed to be the largest march the country has ever seen. On Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, women and the men who support them filled the streets, plazas and squares of Washington and cities across the country, as well as across the world. It was a breathtaking mass of humanity. On the ground in the nation’s capital, it felt as though no square foot of land was empty. From the office windows and balconies of those in power, it looked as though a tide was swallowing cities whole. </p>
<p>It was an amazing, powerful moment full of hope. But there was no unifying message, no concrete demand, no specific goal or 10-point action plan. Now we see: There didn’t have to be. </p>
<p>The women’s march ignited an energy that roiled and swelled through the rest of the year. </p>
<p>By the end of 2017, a seismic change in American culture began toppling dozens of sexual predators in the MeToo movement. A surge of female candidates ran for office and won a stunning number of elections, from city mayors to the nation’s statehouses. </p>
<p>“Women claimed big victories” with the Nov. 7 elections “in a night that marked many firsts and could signal the start of a sea change for women in politics,” wrote Governing magazine, a publication not known for breathless declarations on culture and feminism. “The sheer volume of success for women candidates was a surprise to many, mainly because they were running against incumbents who historically win re-election 90 percent of the time. But not this year. Incumbents in Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia all lost their seats to women.” </p>
<p>The milestones women achieved last year were significant, for sure. But for the most part, they were seals of approval bestowed upon women by the patriarchy. Women made progress because men at male-led institutions scooted their chairs over a bit - just a bit - and let a few women join their circle of power. </p>
<p>But what happened in 2017? That was organic and driven by women. It was a massive shift in our culture. It was 51 percent of the population demanding long-overdue change in the way we are treated. </p>
<p>In one year, our nation went from a place where 46 percent of American voters didn’t mind having a commander in chief who brags about grabbing women’s genitals to a place where a celebrity chef who allegedly gropes his female employees isn’t considered fit to be in the kitchen. </p>
<p>We are officially traveling at warp speed, my friends. </p>
<p>The Unexpected Year of the Woman was breathtaking, and the momentum can’t be stopped. </p>
<p>Watch out, 2018. </p>

<h3>Space, the frightful frontier </h3>
<p>“Star Trek” fever comes with a severe case of the chills in the most riveting offering from a new pack of “Black Mirror” episodes. In “U.S.S. Callister,” Jesse Plemons plays a lonely nerd whose fantasies about being Capt. Kirk take a dark turn when he steers his ambitions into a high-tech video game. Cristin Milioti, so terrific in “How I Met Your Mother” and “Fargo,” keeps her hot streak alive in the role of a shanghaied crew member determined to live long and prosper. </p>
<p style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;">Now streaming on Netflix </p>
<h3>Let’s get the party started </h3>
<p>Ringing in the new year with your TV as company has never been so tempting, especially if you’re dying to see if Mariah Carey can redeem herself after her disastrous appearance last time around on “Dick Clark’s Rockin’ New Year’s Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2018” (7 p.m. Sunday, KSTP, Ch. 5), a party that will also include a performance by Britney Spears. Kathy Griffin isn’t returning to her CNN perch as telegraphed by the new title “New Year’s Eve With Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen” (7 p.m. Sunday, CNN), but you’ll see plenty of familiar faces during Fox News’ “All-American New Year” with co-hosts Lisa Kennedy Montgomery and Jesse Watters (7 p.m. Sunday). Steve Harvey’s campaign to conquer the world continues with “Fox’s New Year’s Eve With Steve Harvey: Live From Times Square” with Andra Day and Maroon 5. Those who want a “classier” approach to the holiday can opt for “NY Philharmonic New Year’s Eve: Bernstein on Broadway” (8 p.m. Sunday, TPT, Ch. 2). </p>
<h3>Keep ’em coming </h3>
<p>No matter how much you might imbibe this holiday weekend, you can’t keep up with Nick and Nora Charles, the two-fisted drinking detectives in “The Thin Man.” One of cinema’s best cocktails of comedy and thrills, the 1934 film is followed by five sequels, all of which will keep you intoxicated through the night. </p>
<p style="font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; opacity: .5; line-height: 1.5em;">7 p.m. Sunday, TCM </p>

<p>The eve of comedy </p>
<p>Certain comedy traditions are practiced on New Year’s Eve in the Twin Cities, including homecomings for “Baskets” case <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Louie Anderson </strong>(6:30 &amp; 9:30 p.m. Sun., Ames Center, Burnsville, <a href="https://www.ames-center.com/louie-anderson.html">$32.95-$102.95</a>) and “Daily Show” co-creator <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Lizz Winstead </strong>(2 p.m. Sat., 7:30 p.m. Sat.-Sun., Cedar Cultural Center, Mpls., <a href="https://www.thecedar.org/event/1578808-lizz-winstead-in-2017-minneapolis/">$45-$65</a>.), as well as local pioneer <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Scott Hansen</strong>’s semiannual parties with <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Jeff Gerbino</strong> and<strong style="font-weight: 500;"> Pete Borchers</strong> (8 &amp; 9:30 p.m. Sat., <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3190927">Turtles Bar and Grill</a>, Shakopee, $20-$25, 1-800-838-3006; 8:30 &amp; 10:30 p.m. Sun., Maple Tavern Bar and Grill, Maple Grove, 763-425-2700). But don’t forget to offer a warm Minnesota welcome to <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Dane Cook</strong>, who just 10 years ago was one of the hottest comics in the land, selling out Madison Square Garden and hosting awards shows. Cook once performed seven hours straight, a feat he’s not likely to repeat to bring in the new year. But you never know. (9:30 p.m. Sun., Mystic Lake, $69-$149. <a href="http://www.mysticlake.com/shows-and-events/dane-cook">mysticlake.com</a>)</p>

<p>There were angry rock songs, folk tunes pleading for peace, love and understanding, and hip-hop tracks steeped in escapism. For me, though, the defining song of 2017 — at least here in Minnesota — was a sweet little nonsensical opus by Jeremy Messersmith called &#8220;Everybody Gets a Kitten.&#8221; </p>
<p>First off, it&#8217;s no secret Minnesotans really love Messersmith and kittens. I mean, what a combo! </p>
<p>The bearded, bespectacled indie strummer has crafted some of this state&#8217;s catchiest and/or deeper-thinking pop and rock tunes of the past decade. And cats, oh boy, did we love them in 2017. </p>
<p>The International Cat Video Festival at CHS Field once again sold out in August. All year long, it seemed like the Star Tribune and/or City Pages were running a new blog post or photo gallery with some kind of special, needy or adorable kitty — or, jackpot, a lot of them! — which were always good for huge, viral traffic numbers. </p>
<p>Messersmith&#8217;s love song to kittens was meant to be a diversion from the headlines, as were all of the tracks on his coyly titled record <a href="http://www.startribune.com/jeremy-messersmith-invites-musicians-fans-to-sing-his-obscenely-optimistic-songs/417993433/">&#8220;11 Obscenely Optimistic Songs for Ukulele.&#8221;</a> Seeing Messersmith perform his &#8220;Obscenely Optimistic&#8221; songs under a big tree in Powderhorn Park as winter thawed in April was one of the more memorable moments in a year of covering Minnesota music.</p>
<p>So was another feline-related moment nearer the end of the year. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/punk-bands-irish-bagpipers-stage-noisy-funeral-for-minneapolis-triple-rock-on-its-final-night/459382463/">On the night the Triple Rock Social Club closed up shop last month</a>, the riotous, lo-fi punk trio Kitten Forever played a set ridiculing, roaring and raging against gender inequality, body-image issues and bone-headed patriarchy. It was the band&#8217;s way of paying tribute to the irreplaceable venue that gave them a forum to play those songs even in years that weren&#8217;t so rife with those topics.</p>
<p>Minnesota music is probably going to be a lot more like that Kitten Forever set in 2018. Here&#8217;s a little more of what defined the scene in 2017. </p>
<p>Best topic for a record this year: Life in the digital age. All wise beyond their 20-something years, Hippo Campus and Reina del Cid both riffed on living and loving in the digital age for their 2017 albums. Hippo Campus&#8217; more atmospheric and experimental effort &#8220;Landmark&#8221; reflected on kids being absorbed with their phone screens, while RdC&#8217;s &#8220;Rerun City&#8221; concerned Netflix binges and solitary lifestyles. Ironically, though, both records were light on digital augmentation. They were recorded in real recording studios with good, old-fashioned instruments. </p>
<p>Best reason to download the St. Paul parking meter app: The Palace Theatre. St. Paul&#8217;s newly reopened theater had an air of familiarity about it <a href="http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-s-palace-theatre-feels-like-a-second-first-ave/415999134/#1">immediately upon opening in March</a>, in part because it&#8217;s run by First Avenue staff. By year&#8217;s end, it had hosted some of the best-sounding and just plain best-vibed bigger rock shows of the year. The Palace had a positive side effect, too, opening up more calendar space at First Ave&#8217;s original main room to local acts and creative dance nights (like this weekend&#8217;s double whammy with the Klituation and Bey Ball).</p>
<p>Best new venue for local talent: The Hook &amp; Ladder Theater. Although it opened in 2016, the Hook &amp; Ladder Theater <a href="http://www.startribune.com/tired-of-noisy-rock-clubs-three-new-minneapolis-listening-rooms-thrive-on-intimacy/411888756/">really hit its stride in 2017</a>. Combining its nonprofit, community-oriented, neighborhood feel with an openness (and fairness) about booking, the converted firehouse hosted everyone from young buzzers like ZuluZuluu, the Shackletons and Little Fevers to older mainstays as diverse as Flipp and Cornbread Harris, all with acoustics and aesthetics simply described as cozy.</p>
<p>Best reminders to not take our local legends for granted: Grant Hart and Sonny Knight. It&#8217;s not often you get to see a musician sing at his own farewell concert, but that&#8217;s essentially what Hüsker Dü co-leader Hart did <a href="http://www.startribune.com/all-star-cast-of-friends-surprises-grant-hart-in-a-special-salute-at-hook-ladder/432202973/">at the Hook &amp; Ladder in July</a>, an emotional night that forecast his death from cancer in September. Soul man Knight didn&#8217;t get to return to the stage before <a href="http://www.startribune.com/remembering-talented-upbeat-twin-cities-soul-singer-sonny-knight/430165693/">cancer claimed him in June</a>, but the tribute to him via Sam Cooke&#8217;s &#8220;Bring It on Home to Me&#8221; in the &#8220;Rise of the Minneapolis Sound&#8221; concert at the Fitzgerald was the year&#8217;s other gut-punching performance.</p>
<p>Best offset to all the Prince legal entanglements: His music, duh. As everyone in-the-know predicted, the messy business affairs left behind by Minnesota&#8217;s most tidily dressed music legend got even messier in 2017, making it seem like we&#8217;ll be waiting until 2047 for a proper posthumous career. Which made the continued array of musical tributes in his hometown seem all the more meaningful and vital, whether it was <a href="http://www.startribune.com/george-clinton-and-p-funk-surprise-prince-fans-at-paisley-park/420013543/">George Clinton bringing the funk at Paisley Park</a> or Dem Atlas, Proper-T and other young scenesters (who weren&#8217;t even alive when &#8220;Purple Rain&#8221; poured) <a href="http://www.startribune.com/first-ave-s-street-party-provides-a-benediction-to-prince-memorials/420181963/">paying their respects at the street party outside First Avenue in April</a>.</p>
<p>Best reason to feel good about our music scene: Charity. In the frustratingly common instances when a band&#8217;s or musician&#8217;s gear got stolen, the scene rallied with crowdfunding campaigns. When musicians or other music professionals got sick, same thing. Maybe the best example came at year&#8217;s end with news of <a href="http://www.startribune.com/mcnally-smith-students-faculty-face-uncertain-future-after-school-s-closure/464509103/">the abrupt closing of McNally Smith College of Music</a> in St. Paul. Faculty members — mostly musicians — finished off the school year for students knowing they weren&#8217;t going to be paid. Meanwhile, restaurants, arts groups and general do-gooders helped feed, house and assist students left high and dry.</p>
<p>Lastly and most importantly &#8230; </p>
<h3>Best local albums of 2017 </h3>
<p>1. The Replacements, </p>
<p>&#8220;For Sale: Live at Maxwell&#8217;s 1986&#8221; </p>
<p>Think it&#8217;s lazy or uncool to put a live recording from 31 years ago at the top of this list? So do I. But I can&#8217;t deny it was my favorite thing. No other record this year rocked this gloriously and murderously. And it really did offer a new and interesting angle on the already over-examined band, after so many bootlegs and stories suggested the &#8216;Mats never had their live act together back in the day. </p>
<p>2. Chastity Brown, </p>
<p>&#8220;Silhouette of Sirens&#8221; </p>
<p>After a decade of honing her writing and an extra year spent remaking this album, the southern-rooted Minneapolis folk-rocker — who&#8217;s always had her molasses-thick voice going for her — pieces it all together beautifully on a record that&#8217;s mostly about personal perseverance. </p>

<p></p>
<p>3. Greg Grease, &#8220;Down So Long&#8221; </p>
<p>The innovative rapper/producer hits on plenty of hot topics, including racist cops and rampant poverty, but keeps a charmingly, defiantly cool head on an album loaded with subversive grooves and simmering wordplay. </p>
<p>4. Dead Man Winter, &#8220;Furnace&#8221; </p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of blood on the tracks on Trampled by Turtles frontman Dave Simonett&#8217;s divorce record, but there&#8217;s also a lot of hopeful harmonies and elegant instrumentation that keeps it from ever feeling as cold as the band name suggests. </p>
<p>5. Mary Bue, &#8220;The Majesty of Beasts&#8221; </p>
<p>The &#8216;90s-flavored Duluth expat covers a lot of musical and lyrical ground on this taut five-song EP, none more flooring than &#8220;Petty Misdemeanor,&#8221; about her own experience with sexual assault and the men who (used to?) get away with it. </p>
<p>6. Romantica, &#8220;Shadowlands&#8221; </p>
<p>Ben Kyle touches on religion, family, music, alcohol and other fun staples of his Irish roots on his enduring Americana rock band&#8217;s first album in nine years, as musically lush as it is poetically rich. </p>

<p>7. Lady Midnight &amp; Afrokeys, </p>
<p>&#8220;Parables of Neptune&#8221; </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a growing wave of local women singers carving out a cool cross-section between the worlds of neo-soul, hip-hop and electronic music. This was the one record in that mix that was as innovative as it was infectious. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Walker Art Center&#8217;s <a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/series/out-there-2018">&#8220;Out There&#8221;</a> series began 30 years ago as a way to get arts lovers out of the house during the dreary, nothing-to-do first month of the year. These days, there are more reasons to venture out in January, but &#8220;Out There&#8217;s&#8221; concerns haven&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is theater going in the future? How can the form be played with/distorted/expanded? How can it speak to our time and the next?&#8221; asks Walker performing arts curator <a href="http://www.startribune.com/philip-bither-getting-out-there-with-the-ultimate-insider/287950581/">Philip Bither</a>, listing some of the questions in the back of his mind as he considers possibilities for &#8220;Out There,&#8221; a series he says he envisions as &#8220;a chance to cleanse the palate in the new year, after lots of &#8216;Nutcrackers&#8217; and &#8216;Christmas Carols.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>One challenge of always looking for the next thing is that audiences catch up. The nipple slip that might have shocked audiences in 1987 is barely Tweet-able now. And walk-outs, once common during &#8220;Out There&#8221; performances, have become less frequent as audiences figured out what to expect from the series — and as artists have stopped thinking of inaccessibility as a badge of honor. That moving-target-of-innovation is why the Walker has become more involved in commissioning works for &#8220;Out There,&#8221; such as this season&#8217;s &#8220;Real Magic&#8221; and &#8220;Quizoola!&#8221; from Forced Entertainment. And it&#8217;s why Bither has had to cast a wider net; work in the series has become more international over the years. </p>
<p>As Bither scours the world, what is he looking for? It may be easier to say what he&#8217;s not looking for: No &#8220;well-made plays,&#8221; meaning traditional works with beginnings, middles and ends. No new pieces from established darlings of the indie art world such as Laurie Anderson or theater-maker Robert Lepage, although the latter will appear at the Walker in his <a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/robert-lepage-887">&#8220;887&#8221; in April</a>). Those folks are too big for the kind of surprises &#8220;Out There&#8221; craves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a chance for us — and for audiences — to take different kinds of chances, to see pieces that are entertaining but, at times, unlike anything else you&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; says Bither. </p>

<p>Despite all that innovation, some tropes have emerged over the years, so we&#8217;ve added labels to help identify &#8220;Out There&#8221; standbys that loom large in this year&#8217;s shows: nudity; politics; playing around with gender; inter-disciplinary (or mixed-media) works; investigating the relationship between artists and audiences, and grappling with the question &#8220;What is theater?&#8221; </p>
<h3><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/teatro-el-publico-antigonon-un-contingente-epico">&#8216;Antigonón, un contingente épico&#8217;</a></h3>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dense work, but very playful and very funny,&#8221; says Bither of this work by the Cuban troupe Teatro El Público, in which the late Fidel Castro is depicted as a monkey. &#8220;There is a critique of the lack of freedom that&#8217;s pretty irreverent and that has lots of built-in questions.&#8221; One Walker fave over the years has been theatrical troupes that boldly re-imagine classic works (Bither says the half of the audience that didn&#8217;t walk out still comes up to him to rave about a Belgian take on &#8220;King Lear&#8221; in 2001). Teatro El Publico fits squarely in that tradition with its loose take on the ancient Greek &#8220;Antigone,&#8221; which pits human will against the gods. The piece will be performed in Spanish, with English subtitles. <span class="Text_Italic">(8 p.m. Jan. 4-6)</span></p>

<h3><a href="https://walkerart.org/calendar/2018/dana-michel-mercurial-george">&#8216;Mercurial George&#8217;</a></h3>
<p>This solo work by Montreal-based choreographer/performer Dana Michel is the most provocative of this year&#8217;s offerings, says Bither, who confesses &#8220;I was having some trouble with it&#8221; when he first saw the piece. &#8220;Mercurial George&#8221; blurs the lines between audience and performer in a way Bither says is meant to make theatergoers uncomfortable about the character they&#8217;re watching. She is, of course, played by an actor but there are times when that actor seems to be experiencing genuine distress in a way that made Bither &#8220;question whether the piece was more disturbing or more fascinating.&#8221; Spoiler alert: He landed on the latter. <span class="Text_Italic">(8 p.m. Jan. 11-13)</span></p>

<p>This interactive piece by the New York-based troupe 600 Highwaymen is designed to give audiences all the feels. &#8220;To me, it felt very much like a gentle instruction around how we could be a better society,&#8221; says Bither of the timely work, which will put theatergoers right on stage with 600 Highwaymen. The artists have said the idea is not just to illustrate how much we all depend on each other, but to live it. <span class="Text_Italic">(8 p.m. Jan. 18-20)</span></p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Starting point guard Jeff Teague sustained a knee injury late in Wednesday&#8217;s Timberwolves victory over Denver. If it&#8217;s serious, backup Tyus Jones will be in the spotlight.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Rand</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-7115" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/randball/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/28120127/teague.jpg">Jeff Teague arrived in Minnesota with a three-year, $57 million contract and a reputation for being a solid point guard who could score and distribute while potentially being a defensive liability. He’s been pretty much as advertised through the Wolves’ first 35 games, and while they owe their 22-13 record more to a handful of other players Teague has been a meaningful contributor.</p>
<p>He’s also been put in two unenviable positions of comparison. </p>
<p>One is to departed point guard Ricky Rubio, a fan favorite even as he polarized the Timberwolves’ rooting base by being quite good at everything except one very important thing: shooting the basketball. It was that deficiency that led coach/basketball boss Tom Thibodeau to move on from Rubio in an offseason unloading trade to the Jazz and to bring in Teague — a much better shooter but a much less flashy passer, among other things. </p>
<p>The second comparison is to backup point guard Tyus Jones — an improving third-year player and astute floor general who also happens to hold a trump card of being a Twin Cities native. </p>
<p>There are Wolves fans who can’t stop wondering what this team would have looked like if Rubio was still here with the improved supporting cast Thibodeau built in the offseason. And there are Wolves fans who have watched Jones and Teague this year and wondered if Jones should be playing more minutes than he has — or even more minutes than Teague. </p>
<p>They will get what they asked for on that second front, albeit under the worst circumstances of a Teague knee injury sustained late in Wednesday’s dramatic overtime win over Denver. Teague has a sprained knee <a href="http://www.startribune.com/timberwolves-jeff-teague-has-sprained-left-knee-no-structural-damage/467002483/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and will miss an unspecified amount of time</a>.</p>
<p>The question now becomes: Is Jones ready for an expanded role? </p>
<p>A quick look at the numbers would seem to suggest he is. </p>
<p>By several measures, Jones has outplayed Teague this season — albeit in playing about half the minutes. In terms of offensive and defensive rating — a measure of points produced or allowed per 100 possessions — Jones has been superior. He’s posted a 125 offensive rating and a 109 defensive rating ( <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per Basketball Reference</a>), while Teague’s offensive rating is 108 compared to a defensive rating of 112.</p>
<p>Jones has a higher true shooting percentage (.598 compared to .549 for Teague), in large part because Jones has actually been better than Teague from three-point range (41.9 percent to 37.5). Teague has a higher assist rate, but Jones turns the ball over less and produces more rebounds and steals. </p>
<p>Most importantly, when Teague was sidelined for a few games earlier this year, Jones showed he could handle an increased workload. In his three starts, Jones played at least 38 minutes each game and the Wolves went 2-1. Jones was a combined plus-45 in those three games (meaning the Wolves outscored opponents by 45 points when he was on the floor). </p>
<p>That said, there’s a big difference between playing well as a fill-in starter for a few games plus performing well off the bench in other games … and being the main guy almost every night like Teague has been. Jones has had the benefit of playing against other teams’ backups in some cases, and playing fewer minutes can hide a player’s weaknesses. Does Jones have the size, strength and quickness to match up with top point guards in the league? It’s a legitimate question. </p>
<p>Jones, though, does have the sort of skill set that would seem to mesh well with the other Wolves starters. The way he gets the Wolves organized is reminiscent, in fact, of Rubio’s skill set. </p>
<p>Jones has played 93 minutes this year in a lineup with the other four Wolves regular starters — Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson and Andrew Wiggins — and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018/lineups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Wolves have outscored opponents by an average of 10.9 points per 100 possessions during those minutes</a>.</p>
<p>It seems a safe bet to assume Jones will add to that total quite a bit Thursday night when the Wolves face Milwaukee in the second night of back-to-back games. </p>
<p>Beyond that, we’ll have to wait and see how he responds and how long Teague is out. </p>

        <title>Judge denies Twin Cities archdiocese bankruptcy plans</title>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Associated Press</h4>
<p>ST. PAUL, Minn. — An attorney for victims for clergy sex abuse said Thursday that a judge has ordered all sides back to mediation in the years-long bankruptcy case of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, but he said the ruling will quicken the process of getting payments to victims. </p>
<p>The judge denied both the archdiocese&#8217;s reorganization plan and a competing plan submitted by a creditors&#8217; committee before ordering all sides back into negotiations, St. Paul attorney Jeff Anderson said. The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015, as it faced an onslaught of new abuse allegations. </p>
<p>Anderson said the judge&#8217;s decision means &#8220;there will be a speedier resolution&#8221; than either plan could have offered. A spokesman for the archdiocese did not immediately reply to messages for comment. </p>
<p>The plan from the archdiocese included a fund of more than $155 million for abuse victims who filed claims in bankruptcy court. The bulk of that money comes from insurance payments. A plan by the survivors&#8217; committee calls for the archdiocese to increase its contributions to the victims&#8217; fund to at least $80 million. </p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of the abuse victims voted in favor for a plan submitted by the creditors&#8217; committee in May. </p>
<p>Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Kressel declined to include parishes and other church properties among assets in the archdiocese&#8217;s bankruptcy. The committee representing abuse victims wanted to consolidate the assets of various entities in the archdiocese, which would have meant more money to pay victims&#8217; claims. </p>

        <title>Foreclosures, mortgage delinquencies drop further in Minnesota</title>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Minnesotans are in the right homes for their wallets, an expert says.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Jim Buchta</h4>
<p>The foreclosure rate in Minnesota is now at the lowest level in more than a decade, and far below the national average. </p>
<p>At the end of September, just 0.2 percent of all Minnesota homeowners with a mortgage lost their homes to foreclosure, according to CoreLogic, which tracks mortgage delinquencies at several intervals. That rate was down from 0.3 percent last year and was only third of the national average. </p>
<p>At the same time, far fewer homeowners are having trouble staying current on their mortgage payments. In Minnesota, 2.9 percent of all homeowners were 30 or more days late on their payment compared with 3.1 percent last year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><style type="text/css">.embed iframe{height:420px;} @media only screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 767px){.embed iframe {height:460px;}}</style></p>
<div><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="420" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gSC4F/2/" width="100%"></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>“We’re encouraged to see another year of flat or declining delinquency rates for homeowners across Minnesota,” said Julie Gugin, director of the Minnesota Homeownership Center. “It shows people are in the right homes for their families and their wallets.” </p>
<p>During the height of the foreclosure crisis, the organization’s counselors were overwhelmed by demand from homeowners who needed help avoiding foreclosure, Gugin said. Today, the need has shifted to providing unbiased information and hands-on financial coaching for low-income families that want to buy a home. </p>
<p>“They want to make choices based on solid and factual information,” Gugin said. “Rent prices are on the rise and homeownership is a valuable asset-building alternate for some families.” </p>
<p>Gugin said that while declining foreclosures is clearly a positive sign, underlying problems linger. Namely, the recession and subsequent economic recovery only broadened the homeownership gap in Minnesota. There are more low-income families than before that are unable to own a home. </p>
<p>“Our goal is to ensure that homeownership’s benefits are fairly available and sustainable to everyone, no matter their race or where they live,” she said. “Next year — and even 10 years from now — we want the delinquency rate to stay low, and with a closed homeownership gap. Individuals and families, communities and our state would be better off as a result.” </p>
<p>Foreclosure rates across the country are also falling. Nationwide, the foreclosure rate fell slightly from 0.8 percent to 0.6 percent, and the 30-day plus delinquency rate fell from 5.2 percent last year to 5.0 percent in September. There was a slight increase, however, in the number of homeowners who were 30 to 59 days late on their payments, mostly because of hurricane-related troubles in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hey, y&#8217;all. Just a quick blog today. </p>
<p>While Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said Wednesday he was hopeful winger Nino Niederreiter would practice Thursday at Xcel Energy Center, the forward was not on the ice for the training session. </p>
<p>&#8220;From what I gather, he&#8217;s skating tomorrow,&#8221; Boudreau said after practice Thursday. &#8220;So I mean, he&#8217;s out this weekend. But hopefully at some point next week, we’d get him back.&#8221; </p>
<p>Niederreiter left the Dec. 22 game at the Florida Panthers in the first period with a left foot or ankle injury and has missed two games for the Wild. With the back-to-back with the Nashville Predators starting 7 p.m. Friday at Xcel Energy Center before the rematch 7 p.m. Saturday at Nashville, Niederreiter might not return until the Jan. 2 home game also against Florida. </p>
<p>Also, Zach Parise wasn&#8217;t at practice since he is likely to play tonight for the Iowa Wild on his rehab assignment. Will be his first game this season. It&#8217;s at 7 p.m. in Des Moines against the Rockford IceHogs. You can listen to the game <a href="https://kxno.iheart.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, I believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m not watching it, I guarantee you I&#8217;ll be getting updates every 10 minutes,&#8221; Boudreau said. </p>
<p>Here were the lines at practice, btw. Nothing out of the ordinary. Also, looked like Ryan Suter and Jared Spurgeon were reunited as a D-pair, as were Jonas Brodin and Matt Dumba. Nate Prosser, Mike Reilly and Gustav Olofsson rotated in the third pair. </p>
<p>Jason Zucker-Mikko Koivu-Mikael Granlund </p>
<p>Tyler Ennis-Eric Staal-Charlie Coyle </p>
<p>Marcus Foligno-Matt Cullen-Zack Mitchell </p>
<p>Daniel Winnik-Joel Eriksson Ek-Chris Stewart </p>

<p><span class="dateline">MILWAUKEE </span>– Timberwolves guard Jeff Teague, injured in Wednesday’s game against Denver, has a sprained MCL in his left knee and will miss an unspecified period of time, beginning with Thursday night’s game against the Bucks.</p>
<p>Teague had an MRI on the knee Thursday and there was no structural damage, a league source confirmed. </p>
<p>Teague had to leave Wednesday’s overtime victory at Target Center following a scrum for a loose ball after a jump ball with 13.4 seconds left in regulation. </p>
<p>Tyus Jones appears ready to take over for Teague. </p>
<p>“As always, it’s whatever the team needs me to do,’’ Jones said after Wednesday’s game win. “I’m hoping Jeff is all right. You never want to see anyone go out with an injury. But it’s the next man up. I’m ready to help this team in any way.’’ </p>
<p>Jones started three straight games in November when Teague was out because of a sore Achilles. The Wolves went 2-1 and Jones averaged 12.3 points and 6.7 assists while shooting 54.1 percent. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A developer proposed building a 17-story, luxury residential tower near the Galleria in Edina, the latest attempt to build a highrise in the affluent suburb for an expected surge of older wealthy people in coming years. </p>
<p>The complex, located on Hazelton Road close to France Avenue, would offer 170 units ranging from one-bedroom apartments to three-bedroom penthouses as well as two-story townhouses along the Promenade greenway. </p>
<p>The developer behind the proposal is Lund Real Estate Partners, a Twin Cities-based real estate company led by Tom Lund. He was vice president of development for The Opus Group from 1997 through 2013, then co-founded Illinois-headquartered Harbor Bay Real Estate Advisors and Lund Real Estate Partners. </p>
<p>Lund submitted a sketch plan dated Dec. 20 to Edina city planners, who say the project is expected to be discussed at the Jan. 10 planning commission meeting. ESG Architects of Minneapolis designed the project. </p>
<p>“As we watch the community transformation happening before us, we have also been struck by the lack of upscale multifamily alternatives for existing and future residents of Edina,” Lund wrote in the proposal. “As recent empty nesters, we have each witnessed our friends and neighbors leave Edina for perhaps a condo at The Carlyle in downtown Minneapolis or an apartment at The Lakes on Calhoun. Not always by choice.” </p>
<p>The complex would have an enclosed 255-stall parking garage, a fitness and yoga studio, clubroom, outdoor deck and bike storage and lounge for maintenance. </p>
<p>Lund’s team was attracted to the site due to its walkability where residents could easily travel on foot to stores and other amenities. </p>
<p>Currently, the site is home to the 12,000-square-foot Guitar Center building, which would need to be demolished to make way for the more than 300,000 square-foot high-rise. According to Hennepin County property records, the property is owned by apartment development company StuartCo. </p>
<p>StuartCo. leadership wasn’t immediately available to comment Thursday. Guitar Center representatives also couldn’t be reached. </p>
<p>The apartment tower would join a list of high-density, housing projects that have been recently proposed in Edina. This past summer, developer EG Capital <a href="http://www.startribune.com/the-two-towers-and-bike-bridge-project-in-edina-has-changed-to-one-tower-and-a-bridge/439942063/">submitted plans</a> for a residential development further down France Avenue at Gallagher Drive. A couple of months ago, city leaders <a href="http://www.startribune.com/edina-rejects-height-change-for-residential-towers-project/451460133/">rejected</a> a plan by developer Ryan Cos. to build two condo towers further north on the other side of France Avenue.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Bloomington-based Doran Companies and KM2 Development of Minneapolis <a href="http://www.startribune.com/doran-will-build-housing-at-site-of-former-best-buy-southdale-store/463488583/">started demolishing</a> the empty Best Buy store at the Southdale Shopping Center to make way for a five-story, 185-unit apartment building.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">News conference will be held at 2 p.m. by attorney for some of the victims</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By David Chanen</h4>
<p>A federal bankruptcy judge has rejected the two compensation plans presented in court to settle clergy abuse claims against the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. </p>
<p>Jeff Anderson, an attorney for several of the abuse victims, will hold a news conference at 2 p.m. to explain Judge Robert Kressel’s ruling and what will happen next in the case. </p>
<p>In his decision Thursday, Kressel ordered the archdiocese, insurance companies, parishes, creditors’ committee and the sexual abuse survivors, back to mediation. </p>
<p>In August, Kressel heard from more than 20 attorneys about the plans, which aim to put an end to more than two years of legal wrangling. </p>
<p>The plan by the committee representing abuse survivors calls for tougher settlements with insurance companies and far greater contributions from the archdiocese. But it faced objections from the archdiocese, parishes and insurance companies for being too far reaching and essentially “liquidating” the archdiocese. </p>
<p>The archdiocese’s plan, which includes $156 million for the more than 400 people who have filed claims of clergy sex abuse, drew opposition from victims’ attorneys who have said that it is inadequate and lets insurers and parishes off the hook. </p>
<p>Kressel did not rule on either plan in August, but he expressed concern about the length of time that would transpire before the survivors would receive compensation. At least two survivors with claims already have passed away, he said. </p>
<p>The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in January 2015, citing the number of clergy abuse claims made possible through the Minnesota Child Victims Act, which opened a window for older abuse cases to be heard in civil court. That window closed in 2016. </p>
<p>The Twin Cities case is unusual among the 15 bankrupt dioceses and archdioceses in the country, as the judge allowed the two competing compensation plans to be heard in court, said Anderson. </p>
<p>The archdiocese plan calls for tapping about $120 million in insurance settlements, plus about $30 million from the archdiocese and from some parishes, to create a fund for sex abuse victims who filed claims in bankruptcy court. It includes a court order to prevent them from filing future lawsuits against the parishes and insurers involved. </p>
<p>The competing plan filed by the survivors’ committee calls for the archdiocese to increase its own contributions to the victims’ fund from the current $15 million to at least $80 million. </p>

                                    </div>
<p>A Twin Cities photographer on Thursday accused Twins third baseman Miguel Sano of grabbing her and trying to kiss her after an autograph session at a local mall in 2015, saying on Twitter that &#8220;no, he didn&#8217;t rape me, but he sure did assault me.&#8221; </p>
<p>Betsy Bissen, who occasionally photographed Twins games on a freelance basis for the Twins Daily fan website, <a href="https://twitter.com/BitzyBetsy/status/946407707606740992">posted on Twitter her description </a>of the October 2015 incident, which she said left her body &#8220;sore all over from having to fight off this athlete that thought he was entitled to take advantage of me against my will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post on the incident quickly gained viral attention on social media, the latest instance of the &#8220;#MeToo&#8221; movement in which women have come forward to disclose unwanted advances and assaults by men. A few hours after Bissen&#8217;s tweet, Sano issued a statement denying that it happened, and Major League Baseball announced it is investigating the allegations. </p>
<p>The Twins, Bissen tweeted, knew nothing of the incident; while she shared the story with close friends and family members, she said, she waited until now to come forward in order &#8220;to feel free of this burden I&#8217;ve carried with me since 2015.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sano, who made the American League All-Star team in July but missed nearly all of the season&#8217;s final six weeks with a stress reaction in his left shin that required surgery in November, has spent much of December at the team&#8217;s Fort Myers, Fla., training complex. TMZ Sports published a statement it said was from Sano that read, &#8220;I unequivocally deny the allegation made against me today — it never happened. I have the utmost respect for women, especially those working in professional sports, and I deeply sympathize with anyone who has experienced sexual harassment. There is no place for it in our society.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Twins issued this statement: &#8220;Today the Minnesota Twins were made aware of allegations involving Miguel Sano at an off-site appearance during the 2015 season. The Twins, along with Major League Baseball, take these allegations very seriously. Until more information is gathered, the Twins will have no further comment.&#8221; </p>
<p>The incident, Bissen confirmed, occurred after an autograph-signing appearance by Sano at Fan HQ, a sports memorabilia and apparel shop at Ridgedale Center in Minnetonka, on the next-to-last day of the 2015 regular season. After the event, Sano grabbed Bissen, who had been taking photos of Sano interacting with fans, by the wrist and insisted that she accompany him as he shopped, Bissen wrote. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to cause a scene, so I just went along,&#8221; Bissen said in her post. </p>
<p>After a half-hour, Sano decided to leave with his agent, and went out a back door, Bissen said, then said he needed to use a restroom. When Bissen pointed at the door, she wrote, &#8220;the athlete took that as a signal that I wanted him to grab me and try to take me back through that door.&#8221; Bissen described a struggle with Sano, who was grasping her wrist, as he &#8220;leaned down and tried to kiss me, more than once. Every time he did, I said no and kept pulling back. … When I said no, it should have been the end of it. He should have respected that and stopped. Instead, he hurt me and kept going.&#8221; </p>
<p>The assault, Bissen wrote, continued for 10 minutes, even when she screamed for help, before Sano finally gave up. </p>
<p>Rob Plummer, Sano&#8217;s agent at the time, did not respond to Star Tribune calls seeking comment. But he told ESPN that while he was with Sano that day, he was unaware of any assault. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was outside next to the car, waiting for him to come out on the other side of the loading bay dock, so I don&#8217;t know what happened inside,&#8221; Plummer, who was fired by Sano in January 2016, told ESPN. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see or hear anything.&#8221; </p>
<p>Bissen&#8217;s post was retweeted more than 1,400 times within three hours of posting, and received hundreds of replies — including a couple from Twins players. Former Twin Trevor Plouffe, Sano&#8217;s teammate at the time, tweeted &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry about this. I understand why you didn&#8217;t, but I wish you would have come to me.&#8221; </p>
<p>And current Twins pitcher Trevor May tweeted, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Betsy.&#8221; </p>
<p>Under MLB&#8217;s collective bargaining agreement with the players, the Commissioner&#8217;s office, not individual teams, has the authority to investigate instances of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse and impose penalties. </p>
<p>Bissen&#8217;s post also described harassment by &#8220;the first-base coach [who was] hitting on me almost every game I was at.&#8221; The Twins&#8217; first base coach at the time was Butch Davis, whose contract was not renewed after the 2016 season. Bissen wrote that she could ignore his comments, which &#8220;didn&#8217;t bother me until he tried to ask for my phone number. A married man, around 20 years older than me. I didn&#8217;t oblige.&#8221; </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Associated Press</h4>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Latest on President Donald Trump&#8217;s statements related to North Korea (all times local): </p>
<p>2:55 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is reminding the world that he&#8217;s long warned about the dangers posed by North Korea&#8217;s nuclear program. </p>
<p>Trump tweeted a compilation video Thursday that includes edited footage of an interview he did with NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; nearly two decades ago. </p>
<p>In the interview, Trump said he&#8217;d be willing to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea if negotiating &#8220;like crazy&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. And he describes the country as &#8220;sort of wacko.&#8221; </p>
<p>Trump tweets that he&#8217;s &#8220;been saying it for a long, long time. #NoKo.&#8221; </p>
<p>Trump earlier Thursday singled out China following reports that Chinese ships transferred oil to North Korean vessels at sea in violation of U.N. sanctions over the North&#8217;s nuclear weapons program. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for China&#8217;s foreign ministry said Wednesday China has strictly enforced trade restrictions. </p>
<h4>___ </h4>
<p>12:10 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is attacking China following reports that Chinese ships improperly transferred oil to North Korean vessels at sea, saying there &#8220;will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!&#8221; </p>
<p>Trump said on Twitter Thursday that China had been &#8220;Caught RED HANDED,&#8221; adding he was &#8220;very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea.&#8221; </p>
<p>Trump did not provide additional details. </p>
<p>The South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo cited unidentified officials this week as saying Chinese ships transferred oil to North Korean vessels some 30 times since October. </p>
<p>China&#8217;s foreign ministry has defended its enforcement of U.N. sanctions. A ministry spokeswoman said Wednesday she had no information about the latest report, but said China has strictly enforced trade restrictions. </p>

<p>WATERBURY, Conn. — Police have decided not to cite a woman who hit and critically injured a former Connecticut lawmaker and prominent businessman with her car. </p>
<p>The Republican-American reports authorities found Birgit Clemente&#8217;s vision may have been obscured by bushes and a glare from the sun when she struck former Republican state Rep. Selim Noujaim on Oct. 30 in Waterbury. </p>
<p>Noujaim had been placing signs for his nephew, who was running for office. He suffered a head injury and was treated at and released from a hospital. </p>
<p>Police gave Noujaim a verbal warning for hazardous entrance onto a highway. </p>
<p>Noujaim previously told the newspaper he could not remember the crash. </p>
<p>Noujaim&#8217;s attorney and Clemente can&#8217;t be reached for comment. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Associated Press</h4>
<p>MAHWAH, N.J. — A town facing federal and state lawsuits over ordinances alleged to discriminate against Orthodox Jews is poised to take a vote that could reshape the dispute. </p>
<p>Mahwah&#8217;s town council was expected to vote Thursday night on reversing a ban on out-of-state residents using the town&#8217;s parks. The ban was prompted by some town residents&#8217; complaints about overcrowding at the parks and their use by Orthodox Jewish families coming from towns across the nearby New York border. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the council reversed part of an ordinance that effectively banned eruvs, pieces of plastic piping attached to utility poles that serve as boundary markers delineating areas where Orthodox Jews can carry items and perform some activities during their Sabbath. </p>
<p>The lawsuits allege those measures are an attempt to keep Orthodox Jews from New York&#8217;s Rockland County out of Mahwah. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed by the state in October seeks to block the ordinances and to secure the return of more than $3.4 million in state grants the town has received from the state Department of Environmental Protection. It characterized the town&#8217;s actions as resembling &#8220;1950s-era white flight suburbanites&#8221; who sought to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The state contends Mahwah violated New Jersey&#8217;s Green Acres Act by banning out-of-state residents from its parks, and it wrote that land acquired under the law cannot be restricted on the basis of religion or residency. </p>
<p>Mahwah council president Robert Hermansen this week denied anti-Semitism played any role in the decisions. He has said the council simply followed the principle that &#8220;In Mahwah, Mahwah residents come first.&#8221; </p>
<p>Town officials don&#8217;t have to look far (or far back) to find a similar dispute. Tenafly, a borough just north of the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey and New York City, was forced to pay a Jewish group more than $300,000 in legal fees and allow the group to keep its eruv up after a six-year legal battle. </p>

<p>A 40-year term is the sentence for a man who fatally beat a 2-year-old boy early this year, ending at least two months of physical abuse he inflicted on his girlfriend’s child in the Crystal residence they shared. </p>
<p>Quran J. Mitchell, 22, was sentenced Thursday in Hennepin County District Court after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in connection with <a href="http://www.startribune.com/authorities-id-crystal-2-year-old-allegedly-beaten-to-death-by-mom-s-boyfriend/413838763/">the death of Joshua Isaiah Lockhart Jr. on Feb. 12</a>. A first-degree murder count was dismissed as part of the plea deal reached last month.</p>
<p>An autopsy disclosed that the boy had head and eye injuries and bruises on his left arm, shoulder, ear, cheek and forehead. </p>
<p>With credit for time in jail since his arrest, Mitchell will serve the first 26 or so years in prison and the balance on supervised release. </p>
<p>Mitchell was on probation at the time he beat Joshua in the house in 3400 block of Adair Avenue where he rented space. Less than 30 days before Joshua’s death, Mitchell had been sentenced to 90 days in the workhouse on a misdemeanor domestic assault conviction, but that incarceration was set aside by Hennepin County Judge Bruce Peterson. </p>
<p>Mitchell also has a misdemeanor disorderly conduct conviction stemming from his involvement in a fight in November 2015. </p>

<p>A search of state court records soon after the boy died revealed no child protection investigations involving the mother, Ashley King, or the boy’s father, Joshua Lockhart Sr. </p>
<p>On the night of Feb. 11, when Joshua was taken to a hospital, doctors determined the boys’ injuries were “all indicative of child abuse,” read a statement from the county attorney’s issued upon <a href="http://www.startribune.com/head-injuries-kill-2-year-old-boy-in-crystal-mom-s-boyfriend-charged/413725653/">Mitchell being charged</a>.</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By TERRY TANG
                                                                                                                                            Associated Press</h4>
<p>PHOENIX — A U.S. judge has permanently blocked an ethnic studies ban in Arizona public schools that dismantled a popular Mexican-American studies program, dealing a final blow to a law that he found to be racially motivated. </p>
<p>Following a seven-year court battle, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima issued a final judgment Wednesday that prohibits Arizona education officials from enforcing the 2010 law, which stirred up more allegations of racial discrimination by a state that passed a landmark crackdown on immigration the same year. </p>
<p>Tashima had previously ruled that racism and political gain were behind the ban&#8217;s creation, findings that he reiterated in this week&#8217;s decision. </p>
<p>Because the law &#8220;was enacted and enforced, not for a legitimate educational purpose, but for an invidious discriminatory racial purpose, and a politically partisan purpose &#8230; (the law) cannot be enforced,&#8221; he wrote. </p>
<p>Attorneys for the state have denied that racial discrimination played a part in the law. The Arizona Attorney General&#8217;s Office, which defended education officials in the case, said it may appeal the ruling. </p>
<p>&#8220;We will consult with the superintendent and see how she would like to proceed,&#8221; spokesman Ryan Anderson said. &#8220;Additionally, we have an obligation to evaluate the likelihood of success on appeal for the individual findings.&#8221; </p>
<p>Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas and the state Board of Education did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Thursday. </p>
<p>The law banned courses appearing to promote resentment toward a race or class of people or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of treating people as individuals. </p>
<p>Lawmakers passed it after Tucson Unified School District began offering classes in 1998 focused on Mexican-American history, literature and art. </p>
<p>Steven Reiss, an attorney for Tucson students who sued over the law, was pleased by the ruling. </p>
<p>&#8220;That should make it clear to everyone in the state: This law is not only invalid and cannot be enforced, it makes it clear that the Tucson Unified School District is absolutely free to readopt the Mexican-American studies program,&#8221; Reiss said. </p>
<p>The Tucson district ceased the classes in 2012 to avoid the threat of losing 10 percent of their state funding as a penalty. District officials did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Thursday. </p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Sally Ann Gonzales of Tucson praised the ruling. </p>
<p>&#8220;Attacking the Mexican-American studies program sends the wrong message to Arizona&#8217;s students and denies the state&#8217;s rich and diverse history,&#8221; Gonzales said in a statement. &#8220;It is important for Arizona to teach the history of minority communities of the past and present day.&#8221; </p>
<p>During a July trial over the lawsuit, Tom Horne, a former state attorney general and state superintendent, defended the law he drafted. He testified that he was troubled by what he described as radical instructors teaching students to be disruptive but insisted he targeted all ethnic studies programs equally. </p>
<p>Education officials can move to dissolve the injunction once it expires in seven years, the judge said. </p>

<p>Tom Baden, the head of Minnesota Information Technology Services — which builds and maintains the state’s IT infrastructure, projects and services — announced Thursday that he is retiring. </p>
<p>His last day as IT services commissioner and the state’s chief information officer is Feb. 2. His departure comes as the IT organization grapples with complaints about the new Minnesota Licensing and Registration System, which <a href="http://www.startribune.com/gov-mark-dayton-other-officials-apologize-for-minnesota-licensing-problems/457814753/#1">has caused delays </a>for Minnesotans trying to get vehicle titles, renew their tabs or transfer license plates.</p>
<p>Baden, who has worked in state government for 36 years, said in a statement that he is retiring now to recover from unforeseen complications stemming from some health issues. </p>
<p>“In the coming days, Governor Dayton will begin an active search for a new State Chief Information Officer,” he said in a statement. “It has been the honor of a lifetime leading MNIT and watching us grow as an organization.” </p>
<p>A spokeswoman with the department said Baden was not available for further comment Thursday. </p>
<p>Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Baden as the state’s IT services commissioner and chief information officer in 2015. He oversees a staff of about 2,200. </p>
<p>Baden previously led the IT team for the Department of Human Services, and helped handle the rocky rollout of the MNsure health insurance exchange. He has worked with various state departments over the years, including the Department of Employment and Economic Development. </p>
<p>His biography on state’s website says he is a seasoned singer-guitarist, who likens IT to the nuances of a rock performance, where everyone must be in sync. </p>
<p>“It’s our job to ensure that the ‘performers’ and ‘instruments’ in our environment are playing in unison — helping to provide the essential services that Minnesotans rely upon,” it states. </p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS — Sen. Al Franken is meeting with supporters and friends in Minnesota before he officially resigns. </p>
<p>The Democrat planned to attend an event Thursday night in Minneapolis to thank supporters and friends after his eight years in the Senate. Media outlets were expected to be allowed to attend part of the event. </p>
<p>Franken announced his plans to resign earlier this month amid a storm of sexual misconduct allegations. He&#8217;ll officially step down on Tuesday. His successor, current Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, is set to be sworn in on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The former Saturday Night Live comedian first won his Senate seat in 2009, after a lengthy recount. He officially beat Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes. </p>
<p>But support from many of his fellow Senate Democrats collapsed after the sexual misconduct allegations. Franken disputed or denied many of the accounts. </p>

<p>A decision on whether Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor should be charged in the shooting death of Justine Damond will be made sometime in 2018, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement Thursday. </p>
<p>Freeman reversed several previous statements he had made that he would make a charging decision on the case before the end of the year. But he said Thursday that the investigation is not done. </p>
<p>“We are getting more information and evidence and additional investigation must be completed. As I have mentioned before, the investigation and review of the case will not be rushed. It is more important to get it right than to get it done quickly,” Freeman said. </p>
<p>He refused to take questions from the media. </p>
<p>Noor shot and killed Damond on July 15, after the Australia native called 911 twice to report a possible sexual assault outside of her south Minneapolis home then went into the back alley. Noor and his partner, Matthew Harrity, responded to the call. When she approached the squad, Noor, from the passenger’s seat, shot across Harrity in the driver’s seat, striking Damond in the lower abdomen. </p>

<p>In one of his last speeches to supporters before he resigns, U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., promised to continue fighting for the causes he has championed over the past decade. </p>
<p>“Here’s my promise to you,” he told about 300 supporters, family members and friends gathered Thursday night in northeast Minneapolis. “I may be leaving the Senate, but I’m not giving up my voice. We still have a lot of work to do together on issues ranging from net neutrality to climate change.” </p>
<p>It was Franken’s first public appearance in Minnesota since he was accused of sexual harassment, followed by his decision to resign from the Senate. He spent the evening thanking those who have supported him over the years and amid the turmoil of recent weeks. </p>
<p>“One of the hardest things about leaving this job will be not getting to work alongside you every day, but I cannot wait to see what you do next,” he said, his voice cracking as he thanked his staff. </p>
<p>Campaign and office staff, state officials and politicians sipped drinks and snacked at the Machine Shop event space, where many lamented his resignation. </p>
<p>Franken, 66, <a href="">plans to step down Jan. 2,</a> a decision he made after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment. When the first allegations emerged in November, he apologized and offered to undergo a Senate ethics investigation. But as the number of similar stories mounted, many of his colleagues in the Senate urged him to resign, and he decided to heed their call.</p>

<p>Christy Dickinson, who worked on Franken’s campaigns, was one of several people at the event who said she wishes he would have stayed in office and gone through the investigation. “It leaves a bit of ambiguity,” she said, and she feels he is leaving without due process. </p>
<h3>Survey shows support </h3>
<p>“It will be hard to find another person that will continue that work in the same way,” Dickinson said. She said Franken spent a lot of time getting to know the issues and the people who often don’t have a voice in Washington, D.C., including immigrants and members of Minnesota’s American Indian communities. She said he has operated in the mold of his political idol, the late Sen. Paul Wellstone — who got a few shout-outs in Franken’s speech Thursday. </p>
<p>The event came the same day as Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling <a href="">published a survey </a>showing that Franken remains popular in his home state, and 50 percent of Minnesota voters do not think he should resign.</p>
<p>Despite the allegations and political winds against him, a majority of the 671 Minnesota voters interviewed on Dec. 26 and 27 approved of Franken’s job performance, the survey found. It was commissioned by the Strategic Consulting Group, which promotes Democratic causes and campaigns; 40 percent of people who participated in the survey identified as Democrats. </p>
<p>The former “Saturday Night Live” writer and radio host was elected to the Senate in 2008. </p>
<p>“People knew that I was passionate about the issues” when he first ran, Franken said, but they didn’t know if he was serious about the work. “All these years later I am deeply proud of all the work I’ve been able to do on Minnesotans’ behalf.” </p>
<p>In Congress, he worked to move past his comedy background and focused on issues like protecting survivors of sexual assault and net neutrality, which aims to prevent internet service providers from charging people more to access certain websites or applications. </p>
<p>Franken helped make net neutrality a critical issue and has taken on President Donald Trump’s administration more than almost any other senator, said Eliot Seide, the recently retired union director of AFSCME Council 5. </p>
<p>“I hope he continues to play a role in public policy and speaking out,” Seide said. </p>
<p>Since making his resignation announcement three weeks ago, Franken has continued to vote, attend hearings and make speeches in the Senate. </p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tina Smith will be sworn in Jan. 3 and take over his seat. Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Smith to fill the post, and she has said she plans to run in the 2018 special election to keep the seat. </p>
<p>Franken has campaigned hard for other DFL candidates during his years in office, said his state director, Alana Petersen. And in keeping with that work, he offered words of support for his successor. </p>
<p>“We still have terrific candidates worthy of the kind of incredible support I have received,” he told the crowd. “Starting with my friend Tina Smith.” </p>

<h4>POLICE: SUSPECT WEARING &#8220;TRUST ME&#8221; T-SHIRT STEALS CAR </h4>
<p>FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — A suspect wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with &#8220;Trust Me&#8221; allegedly stole a car with an accomplice in Fairfax County, Virginia. </p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that the two suspects from Falls Church were arrested by police in the stolen car not long after the unlocked Honda Civic was taken as it warmed up. </p>
<p>Police say they also found several forged checks during the arrests. </p>
<p>The newspaper says Wilmer Lara Garcia has been charged with auto theft and two counts of forgery. Police say he was wearing the shirt that read &#8220;Trust Me.&#8221; </p>
<p>His accomplice was charged with auto theft. </p>
<h4>FLORIDA MAN SAYS HE PUNCHED ATM FOR GIVING TOO MUCH CASH </h4>
<p>COCOA, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man told investigators he punched an automatic teller machine because it gave him too much cash. </p>
<p>An arrest report says 23-year-old Michael Joseph Oleksik man caused about $5,000 in damage to an ATM at a Wells Fargo bank branch in Cocoa on Nov. 29. He was arrested Dec. 22 on a criminal mischief charge after bank officials decided to press charges. </p>
<p>Florida Today reports surveillance video captured Oleksik pummeling the touch screen. </p>
<p>An arrest report says that Oleksik told a bank manager he was angry that the machine was giving him too much money and he didn&#8217;t know what to do because he was in a hurry for work. He apologized for causing damage. </p>
<p>Jail records don&#8217;t list a lawyer for Oleksik. </p>
<h4>DEFINITION MISSION: A RHYMING LIMERICK FOR EACH ENGLISH WORD </h4>
<p>One man&#8217;s joke has become his mission: to give each word a rhyming definition. </p>
<p>Chris Strolin was teasing English buffs in an online forum years ago when he said the dictionary would be greatly improved if definitions were written as five-line limericks. Then he decided to try it for real. </p>
<p>The Omnificent English Dictionary in Limerick Form — or OEDILF (OH-dilf) for short — has published more than 97,000 rhyming definitions since Strolin started the online dictionary in 2004. He expects to reach limerick No. 100,000 sometime in 2018. </p>
<p>Even with help from roughly 1,000 contributing writers, Strolin&#8217;s limerick dictionary is nowhere near finished. It currently ends in the Gs at the word &#8220;gizzard.&#8221; </p>
<p>Strolin hopes his grandchildren — or perhaps their kids — will finish the Zs. </p>
<h4>WOMAN STUNNED TO FIND ELECTRIC BILL LISTED AS $284 BILLION </h4>
<p>ERIE, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania woman says she went online to check her electric bill and was stunned at the amount — more than $284 billion. </p>
<p>The Erie Times-News reports that Mary Horomanski said her eyes &#8220;just about popped out&#8221; of her head when she saw the amount. She suspected that her family had put up their Christmas lights wrong. </p>
<p>The silver lining was that she didn&#8217;t have to pay the full amount until November 2018 — only a $28,156 minimum payment was due for December. </p>
<p>Horomanski&#8217;s son contacted Penelac, her electric provider, who confirmed the error. Parent company First Energy said a decimal point was accidentally moved. Her new amount was quickly corrected to $284.46. </p>
<h4>STYLIST ACCUSED OF GIVING MAN UNWANTED &#8216;STOOGES&#8217; HAIRDO </h4>
<p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Police in Madison, Wisconsin, arrested a hairstylist after he gave a customer a very unwanted Larry Fine hairdo. </p>
<p>Police spokesman Joel DeSpain says the 22-year-old victim told officers the stylist asked him to stop fidgeting and moving his head during the Friday haircut. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that DeSpain says the stylist then nicked the customer&#8217;s ear with his clippers before running them down the middle of the man&#8217;s head on their shortest attachment, &#8220;leaving him looking a bit like Larry from &#8216;The Three Stooges.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
<p>DeSpain says officers arrested the 46-year-old hairstylist, Khaled A. Shabani, who pleaded not guilty to disorderly conduct Wednesday. DeSpain says Shabani told officers it was an accident. </p>
<h4>WOMAN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNORT COCAINE IN POLICE STATION </h4>
<p>LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) — A woman has been accused of trying to snort cocaine inside a Connecticut police station while waiting to be booked on unrelated charges. </p>
<p>Police say Nicole Hunter was charged on Christmas Day with possession of narcotics, interfering with an officer and disorderly conduct. </p>
<p>Police had arrested Hunter after a confrontation at her home in Ledyard while investigating a report of an erratic driver. They say the vehicle involved matched the one in Hunter&#8217;s driveway. </p>
<p>Police say Hunter was in a waiting area of the police station when she pulled cocaine wrapped in paper from inside her clothing and tried to snort it. </p>
<p>Hunter doesn&#8217;t have a listed phone number and can&#8217;t be reached for comment. She&#8217;s due in court Jan. 8. </p>
<h4>ANTI-GAMBLING CRUSADER WINS $25K IN GAMING SWEEPSTAKES </h4>
<p>CHICAGO (AP) — A suburban Chicago woman who has crusaded against gambling for decades has won $25,000 by playing a sweepstakes game at a gambling cafe. </p>
<p>Kathy Gilroy tells the Chicago Tribune that while it&#8217;s ironic she won the sweepstakes, the distinction is that she didn&#8217;t spend her own money to gamble. </p>
<p>Gilroy has said gambling can lead to addiction, bankruptcy, crime and suicide. She helped shut down a $1.6 million Queen of Hearts raffle put on by the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in rural Morris this year until the raffle was properly licensed. </p>
<p>Gilroy says she&#8217;s participated in other sweepstakes and won prizes, including electronics and trips to the Bahamas and California. She says she enters sweepstakes because they&#8217;re made available free of charge under state law. </p>
<h4>POLICE: WOMAN RUINED $300K WORTH OF ART ON DATE WITH LAWYER </h4>
<p>HOUSTON (AP) — Authorities say an intoxicated Dallas woman on a first date with a prominent Houston trial lawyer caused at least $300,000 in damage to his art collection, including two Andy Warhol paintings. </p>
<p>Lindy Lou Layman was arrested Saturday on criminal mischief charges after her date with Anthony Buzbee. She was released on $30,000 bond. Online court records don&#8217;t list an attorney for her. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say Buzbee told investigators that the 29-year-old Layman got too intoxicated on their date, so he called her an Uber after they returned to his home. She allegedly refused to leave and hid inside the home, and that when Buzbee found her and called a second Uber, she got aggressive. </p>
<p>Authorities say she tore down several paintings and poured red wine on some, and she threw two $20,000 sculptures. </p>
<p>The damaged Warhol paintings were each valued at $500,000. </p>
<h4>MAN CHARGED WITH SNEAKING INTO HOME TO TRY TO STEAL UNDIES </h4>
<p>WASHINGTON, Mo. (AP) — Police say an eastern Missouri man told officers he has an &#8220;underwear fetish&#8221; and admitted to sneaking into a home to try to steal a pair. </p>
<p>The St. Louis Post- Dispatch reports that 34-year-old Cody Hassler, of Washington, Missouri, was charged Wednesday with first-degree burglary, first-degree stalking and stealing. No attorney is listed in online court records. Bond is set at $75,000. </p>
<p>Police say Hassler admitted to sneaking into the house through an unlocked basement door in October while a mother and her teenage daughter were sleeping and taking a pair of underwear from the laundry room. </p>
<p>The teenager awoke when she heard footsteps and police were called. Officers found a pair of underwear that apparently had been dropped when the suspect fled. Hassler also admitted to looking through bedroom windows. </p>
<h4>BURNT BAGEL BLAMED FOR ST. LOUIS AIRPORT EVACUATION </h4>
<p>ST. LOUIS (AP) — A burnt bagel is being blamed for the evacuation of a terminal at Lambert Airport in St. Louis. </p>
<p>Airport officials say a bagel burned in a restaurant in Terminal 2 around 6 p.m. Tuesday, setting off smoke detectors and prompting a full evacuation. An estimated 300 to 400 people were required to go outside, where the temperature was 11 degrees. </p>
<p>The airport says the evacuation lasted only about five minutes, but passengers had to go back through security checks once they re-entered the building. No flight delays were reported. </p>
<h4>A COUGAR IN YOUR LUGGAGE? HUNTING CARCASS FOUND AT AIRPORT </h4>
<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Police say a hunter&#8217;s trip home hit a snag in Las Vegas after security screeners found a dead cougar in his luggage. </p>
<p>No crime was committed because the man had a hunting tag. But police Lt. David Gordon told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Transportation Security Administration agents held the man at McCarran International Airport late Tuesday to confirm the validity of the Utah hunting tag. </p>
<p>His name and where he was headed weren&#8217;t released. </p>
<p>Airport spokeswoman Melissa Nunnery says the man ended up shipping the cougar carcass home, not on the airplane. </p>
<p>Gordon says it&#8217;s not a crime to transport legally possessed game on an airline flight. But he says airlines can refuse to transport certain items. </p>
<h4>LIFELONG BEST FRIENDS DISCOVER THEY&#8217;RE ACTUALLY BROTHERS </h4>
<p>HONOLULU (AP) — Two Hawaii men who grew up as best friends have recently learned that they&#8217;re actually brothers. </p>
<p>Alan Robinson and Walter Macfarlane have been friends for 60 years. Born in Hawaii 15 months apart, they met in the sixth grade and played football together at a Honolulu prep school. </p>
<p>Macfarlane never knew his father. Robinson was adopted. </p>
<p>Honolulu news station KHON-TV reports that the men learned they&#8217;re related through a family history and DNA website. They revealed the discovery Saturday. </p>
<p>Macfarlane&#8217;s daughter, Cindy Macfarlane-Flores, says when they started digging into answers about his family history, a top DNA match was someone with the username Robi737. </p>
<p>Robinson&#8217;s nickname was &#8220;Robi&#8221; and he flew 737s for Aloha Airlines. </p>
<p>They plan to travel and enjoy retirement together. </p>
<p>Robinson says it&#8217;s the best Christmas present. </p>
<h4>POLICE: MAN ATTEMPTS TO ROB STORE WITH FAKE FURNITURE GUN </h4>
<p>AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Police say a man who tried and failed to rob an Ohio convenience store with a fake gun made from pieces of furniture has been charged with robbery. </p>
<p>Akron police say the man walked into a local Circle K store Monday afternoon waving what appeared to be a rifle and demanding cash. An employee realized the rifle was a fake and confronted the man with the help of three customers. </p>
<p>The man tried to flee but was subdued and detained by the people in the store until police arrived. He has been charged with aggravated robbery and is scheduled to appear in municipal court Wednesday. </p>
<p>Police say the man had a pole, a fake scope, a spring and two table legs fastened together to look like a rifle. </p>
<h4>FRUITCAKE PACKAGE TEMPORARILY HALTS SEATTLE FERRY SERVICE </h4>
<p>SEATTLE (AP) — Authorities say a wrapped present that turned out to be a fruitcake temporarily halted service at a Seattle ferry terminal while police investigated. </p>
<p>Washington State Patrol Trooper Kevin Fortino says troopers were notified Tuesday that a suspicious package was found beneath a Christmas tree in the pedestrian waiting area. </p>
<p>Fortino says the package was deemed suspicious because it was unmarked and was the only gift under the tree. </p>
<p>Officials evacuated the terminal and kept all inbound ferries away for about a half-hour while the police bomb squad investigated. </p>
<p>Fortino says the gift was found to be a fruitcake. </p>
<p>He says it wasn&#8217;t clear why it was left at the terminal. </p>
<h4>MAN ARRESTED AFTER SHOWING UP TO CLAIM MARIJUANA SHIPMENT </h4>
<p>WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) — Police in Massachusetts have arrested a Rhode Island man they say showed up at a shipping company in a brand-new pickup truck he had paid cash for to claim two crates that contained 112 pounds of marijuana. </p>
<p>Wareham police say they were tipped off by employees of Cape Cod Express, who were suspicious of the two wooden crates. </p>
<p>When 40-year-old Michael Chen, of Providence, Rhode Island, showed up at the facility on Wednesday to claim them, he was confronted by police and consented to a search of the crates. </p>
<p>Police say they contained 112 pounds of pot combined. </p>
<p>Chen was charged with trafficking in marijuana over 100 pounds. Police also seized his 2017 pickup. </p>
<p>He was freed on $7,500 bail. It was not clear if he had a lawyer. </p>
<h4>DRUGS, GUN, TEETH FOUND ON MAN STOPPED AT S. CAROLINA STORE </h4>
<p>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) — Police say they found thousands of doses of heroin, a gun and human teeth on a man detained during a suspected shoplifting investigation at a South Carolina Walmart on Christmas Eve. </p>
<p>Officers tell the Sun News of Myrtle Beach they charged 21-year-old Tavon Malik Stanley of Calabash, North Carolina, with crimes including heroin trafficking and drug possession. </p>
<p>Officials at a North Myrtle Beach Walmart detained Stanley after they saw a person with him allegedly take around $25 worth of items without paying for them. Stanley had a Ruger 9 mm handgun and more than $2,500 in cash, and officers found dozens of pills, thousands of doses of heroin and two human teeth in his backpack. </p>
<p>Stanley was released from jail on bond. It wasn&#8217;t known if he had an attorney. </p>

<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Associated Press</h4>
<p>MADISON, Wis. — Two Republican state lawmakers are resigning to take jobs with Gov. Scott Walker&#8217;s administration. </p>
<p>Sen. Frank Lasee, of De Pere, and Rep. Keith Ripp, of Lodi, are resigning Friday and will begin working for Walker on Monday. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson says no special election is planned and instead the seats will be filled in the regular November election. </p>
<p>Lasee will become the administrator for the Department of Workforce Development&#8217;s Worker&#8217;s Compensation Division. He will make about $101,000, roughly double his legislator salary. </p>
<p>Ripp will become assistant deputy secretary at the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. That is the No. 3 position at the agency. He will earn about $105,000. </p>
<p>Former state Sen. Sheila Harsdorf resigned her seat in November to take over as DATCP secretary. </p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 300;">Starting point guard Jeff Teague sustained a knee injury late in Wednesday&#8217;s Timberwolves victory over Denver. If it&#8217;s serious, backup Tyus Jones will be in the spotlight.</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1rem;">By Michael Rand</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-7115" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/randball/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/28120127/teague.jpg">Jeff Teague arrived in Minnesota with a three-year, $57 million contract and a reputation for being a solid point guard who could score and distribute while potentially being a defensive liability. He’s been pretty much as advertised through the Wolves’ first 35 games, and while they owe their 22-13 record more to a handful of other players Teague has been a meaningful contributor.</p>
<p>He’s also been put in two unenviable positions of comparison. </p>
<p>One is to departed point guard Ricky Rubio, a fan favorite even as he polarized the Timberwolves’ rooting base by being quite good at everything except one very important thing: shooting the basketball. It was that deficiency that led coach/basketball boss Tom Thibodeau to move on from Rubio in an offseason unloading trade to the Jazz and to bring in Teague — a much better shooter but a much less flashy passer, among other things. </p>
<p>The second comparison is to backup point guard Tyus Jones — an improving third-year player and astute floor general who also happens to hold a trump card of being a Twin Cities native. </p>
<p>There are Wolves fans who can’t stop wondering what this team would have looked like if Rubio was still here with the improved supporting cast Thibodeau built in the offseason. And there are Wolves fans who have watched Jones and Teague this year and wondered if Jones should be playing more minutes than he has — or even more minutes than Teague. </p>
<p>They will get what they asked for on that second front, albeit under the worst circumstances of a Teague knee injury sustained late in Wednesday’s dramatic overtime win over Denver. Teague has a sprained knee <a href="http://www.startribune.com/timberwolves-jeff-teague-has-sprained-left-knee-no-structural-damage/467002483/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and will miss an unspecified amount of time</a>.</p>
<p>The question now becomes: Is Jones ready for an expanded role? </p>
<p>A quick look at the numbers would seem to suggest he is. </p>
<p>By several measures, Jones has outplayed Teague this season — albeit in playing about half the minutes. In terms of offensive and defensive rating — a measure of points produced or allowed per 100 possessions — Jones has been superior. He’s posted a 125 offensive rating and a 109 defensive rating ( <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per Basketball Reference</a>), while Teague’s offensive rating is 108 compared to a defensive rating of 112.</p>
<p>Jones has a higher true shooting percentage (.598 compared to .549 for Teague), in large part because Jones has actually been better than Teague from three-point range (41.9 percent to 37.5). Teague has a higher assist rate, but Jones turns the ball over less and produces more rebounds and steals. </p>
<p>Most importantly, when Teague was sidelined for a few games earlier this year, Jones showed he could handle an increased workload. In his three starts, Jones played at least 38 minutes each game and the Wolves went 2-1. Jones was a combined plus-45 in those three games (meaning the Wolves outscored opponents by 45 points when he was on the floor). </p>
<p>That said, there’s a big difference between playing well as a fill-in starter for a few games plus performing well off the bench in other games … and being the main guy almost every night like Teague has been. Jones has had the benefit of playing against other teams’ backups in some cases, and playing fewer minutes can hide a player’s weaknesses. Does Jones have the size, strength and quickness to match up with top point guards in the league? It’s a legitimate question. </p>
<p>Jones, though, does have the sort of skill set that would seem to mesh well with the other Wolves starters. The way he gets the Wolves organized is reminiscent, in fact, of Rubio’s skill set. </p>
<p>Jones has played 93 minutes this year in a lineup with the other four Wolves regular starters — Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson and Andrew Wiggins — and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2018/lineups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Wolves have outscored opponents by an average of 10.9 points per 100 possessions during those minutes</a>.</p>
<p>It seems a safe bet to assume Jones will add to that total quite a bit Thursday night when the Wolves face Milwaukee in the second night of back-to-back games. </p>
<p>Beyond that, we’ll have to wait and see how he responds and how long Teague is out. </p>

<p><a href="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-13408" src="http://blog-media.startribune.com/access-vikings/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/04003126/SPORTS_FBN-VIKINGS-FALCONS_31_MS_47464608-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, who’s been one of the surprise stories of the 2017 NFL season, will be a free agent in March and is in line for a significant raise next year because of how he’s played while leading the Vikings to a NFC North title. </p>
<p>The fact Keenum has been the Vikings’ starting quarterback for most of this season has him set to earn a little extra money this year, too. </p>
<p>According to sources with access to NFLPA salary data, Keenum would make an extra $250,000 if he plays 85 percent or more of the Vikings’ offensive plays this season. Keenum, who’s played 90.4 percent of the team’s offensive snaps this year, would hit the bonus if he starts on Sunday. He’d earn $150,000 if he plays 75 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps, but with the team still trying to secure a first-round bye against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Keenum figures to play. </p>
<p>He’d also add to a per-game roster bonus that pays him $46,875 each time he’s on the 46-man active roster on game day. Keenum has been active for every game this season, and would maximize his roster bonus at $750,000 if he’s active on Sunday. If he starts and plays most of the Vikings’ snaps, his bonuses and incentives for the season would total $1 million, in addition to $950,000 base salary, $250,000 signing bonus and $50,000 workout bonus. </p>
<p>That’d give Keenum a total of $2.25 million for the season. In any case, he’s going to end the year as a major bargain for the Vikings. But as the team turned to him, it also gave the quarterback a chance to earn a little extra cash. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at several other Vikings players who have a shot at incentives and roster bonuses in the regular-season finale. </p>
<p><strong>G Joe Berger: </strong>Can earn an extra $900,000 if he plays 90 percent of the Vikings’ offensive snaps (Berger has missed just two snaps all season). Berger can also cap out his per-game roster bonus at a total of $250,000 by being on the active roster for the 16th time this season on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>WR Michael Floyd: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $171,875 by being active for his 11th game.</p>
<p><strong>LB Emmanuel Lamur: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>LS Kevin McDermott: </strong>Will likely end the season with per-game roster bonuses of $23,437.50, given the fact he’s expected to miss Sunday’s game with a dislocated left shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>RB Latavius Murray: </strong>Can reach a $500,000 incentive, as well as a $500,000 salary escalator for 2018, by rushing for 169 yards on Sunday and finishing with 900 yards for the season. Can earn another $46,875 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season to tal to $750,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>CB Terence Newman: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Newman, who’s played 56 percent of the Vikings’ defensive snaps this season, is likely to fall short of a $150,000 incentive for playing 65 percent of the Vikings’ defensive plays.</p>
<p><strong>TE Kyle Rudolph: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game. Rudolph, who has 56 catches this season, won’t hit a $375,000 salary escalator for 2018 by reaching 80 catches this year, but already triggered one for next season by catching 83 passes last year.</p>
<p><strong>PR Marcus Sherels: </strong>Can earn a $100,000 incentive if he finishes the regular season as the NFL leader in punt return average. Sherels, who is currently sixth in the league with an average of 10 yards per punt, would need a prolific day to vault up the standings; the Lions’ Jamal Agnew currently leads the league with a 16.0 average.</p>
<p><strong>S Harrison Smith: </strong>Can make another $15,625 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $250,000 by being active for his 16th game.</p>
<p><strong>WR Adam Thielen: </strong>Can earn a $1 million salary escalator for 2018 by catching five passes on Sunday, bringing his season total to 90 catches. Thielen has already secured a $750,000 salary escalator for next year by reaching 80 catches.</p>
<p><strong>WR Jarius Wright: </strong>Can make another $93,750 in per-game roster bonuses on Sunday, bringing his season total to $1.5 million by being on the 53-man roster for his 16th game. Wright restructured his deal with the Vikings before the season, taking a $1.05 million base salary instead of the $2.5 million he was scheduled to receive and converting $1.5 million to per-game bonuses. The restructuring came just before roster cuts at the end of the preseason.</p>
<p>Wright caught just 11 passes last season; with rookies Rodney Adams and Stacy Coley on the team’s initial 53-man roster, and Floyd set to join the team in October after a four-game suspension, the Vikings clearly wanted to retain some flexibility with the 28-year-old. The team wasn’t in a tight cap situation, and players don’t usually agree to convert base salaries to week-to-week bonuses unless they believe they’re at risk of not earning the money at all. </p>
<p>But Adams eventually wound up on the practice squad; Coley has played 27 snaps this season, and Floyd has caught only 10 passes for 78 yards. Wright has 18 catches for 178 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He could have to fight to stick around again in 2018, when his base salary is scheduled to jump back to $3.6 million, but he’s handled his role without griping and continued to prove his value. </p>
