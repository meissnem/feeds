Pictured, behind this darker cloud, is a pileus iridescent cloud, a group of water droplets that have a uniformly similar size and so together diffract different colors of sunlight by different amounts. The featured image was taken last month in Pu'er, Yunnan Province, China. Also captured were unusual cloud ripples above the pileus cloud. The formation of a rare pileus cloud capping a common cumulus cloud is an indication that the lower cloud is expanding upward and might well develop into a storm."

This time-lapse, color-enhanced movie covers about four hours and morphs between 36 JunoCam images. The video begins with Jupiter rising as Juno approaches from the north. As Juno reaches its closest view -- from about 3,500 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail. Juno passes light zones and dark belt of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than hurricanes on Earth. After the perijove, Jupiter recedes into the distance, then displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter's south. To get desired science data, Juno swoops so close to Jupiter that its instruments are exposed to very high levels of radiation.</p><figure><iframe width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfM7VlonD5c?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> <figcaption><p><b> Video Credit: </b> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">License</a>: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html\">Juno</a>, <a href=\"http://www.swri.org/\">SwRI</a>, <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/\">MSSS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/connect/our-experts/profiles/ gerald-eichstdt.html\">Gerald Eichstadt</a>; <i> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q91NKLjxXyg\">Music</a>: </i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)\">Moonlight Sonata</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven\">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>) </p></figcaption></figure><p> <b> Explanation: </b> Here comes Jupiter! <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>'s robotic spacecraft <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html\">Juno</a> is continuing on its highly-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit\">elongated orbits</a> around our Solar System's largest planet.
