A close inspection of the featured time-lapse video will reveal a rocket rising to Earth orbit as seen from the International Space Station (ISS). The Russian Soyuz-FG rocket was launched in November 2018 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying a Progress MS-10 (also 71P) module to bring needed supplies to the ISS. Highlights in the 90-second video (condensing about 15-minutes) include city lights and clouds visible on the Earth on the lower left, blue and gold bands of atmospheric airglow running diagonally across the center, and distant stars on the upper right that set behind the Earth. A lower stage can be seen falling back to Earth as the robotic supply ship fires its thrusters and begins to close on the ISS, a space laboratory that celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2018. Astronauts who live aboard the Earth-orbiting ISS conduct, among more practical duties, numerous science experiments that expand human knowledge and enable future commercial industry in low Earth orbit.</p><figure><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1R3dTdcpSU?rel=0\" width=\"960\"></iframe> <figcaption><p><b> Video Credit: </b> <a href=\"https://www.isaa.it/\">ISAA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition57/index.html\">Expedition 57 Crew</a> (ISS); <br> <i> Processing: </i> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RikyUnreal\">Riccardo Rossi</a> (ISAA, <a href=\"https://www.astronauticast.it/\">AstronautiCAST</a>); <i> Music: </i> <a href=\"https://www.jamendo.com/track/1585181/inspiring-adventure-cinematic-background\">Inspiring Adventure Cinematic Background</a> by <a href=\"https://www.jamendo.com/artist/491819/maryna\">Maryna</a> </p></figcaption></figure><p> <b> Explanation: </b> Have you ever seen a rocket launch -- from space?

To help understand the difference, NASA's Juno spacecraft, currently orbiting Jupiter, has observed numerous aurora and lightning events.

            "summary": "Why does so much of Jupiter's lightning occur near its poles? Similar to Earth, Jupiter experiences both aurorae and lightning. Different from Earth, though, Jupiter's lightning usually occurs near its poles -- while much of Earth's lightning occurs near its equator. To help understand the difference, NASA's Juno spacecraft, currently orbiting Jupiter, has observed numerous aurora and lightning events. The featured image, taken by Juno's Stellar Reference Unit camera on 2018 May 24, shows Jupiter's northern auroral oval and several bright dots and streaks. An eye-catching event is shown in the right inset image -- which is a flash of Jupiter's lightning -- one of the closest images of aurora and lightning ever. On Earth (which is much nearer to the Sun than Jupiter), sunlight is bright enough to create, by itself, much stronger atmospheric heating at the equator than the poles, driving turbulence, storms, and lightning. On Jupiter, in contrast, atmospheric heating comes mostly from its interior (as a remnant from its formation), leading to the hypothesis that more intense equatorial sunlight reduces temperature differences between upper atmospheric levels, hence reducing equatorial lightning-creating storms."
