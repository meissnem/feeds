                                <div id="transcript-content">Vaginism and Us by narine_do_douce, published on April 15, 2024 on OhJoySexToy.com<br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce draws with a thin, organic line and a few wispy detail lines, giving it that subtly distinct European comic style. The color palette is mostly subtle, earthy yellows, browns, oranges, purples, and sage. Narine_do_douce is self described as a tall french-viet girl with long dark brown hair who always has eyeliner on.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> In the foreground of a bedroom, we see flower petals romantically strewn across the top of a wardrobe, which is also decorated with heart-decorated fancy candles, a box of tissue, two silver internal condom packages, and one used internal condom laid out flat next to them. The room is small and decorated like it belongs to a young woman, either a dorm room or a single, cramped apartment with posters on thee wall, a cork board with photos and notes, a big cartoonish stuffed animal, and a mini coatrack next to the bed with an assortment of hanging clothes. <br />
                                    <br /> A disgruntled couple sits on a bed in the background, clearly post-coital. narine_do_douce is fully nude except for her bedspread that is pulled up over her knees. She sits hunched over, hugging her knees and though she's facing towards her companion, her eyes look over her shoulder. Her companion looks at her with a mixture of being somewhat sheepish and confused as he sits on the edge of her bed, wearing only his shorts.  <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: This weird thing happens every time I try to have sex. Nothing can enter or it hurts like hell...<br />
                                    <br /> From overhead and at a distance, we look down on the companion leaning over to hug narine_do_douce. They feel like a shipwrecked couple sitting on a raft in the middle of the ocean. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I really want to do it but... I can't.<br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce and a friend share a table at a bar, their sophisticated cocktails and an ashtray filling up the foreground. <br />
                                    <br /> "Some guy told me I was too tight." Muses narine_do_douce. Her long black hair flows past her shoulders and she wrests her chin gently against her hand.<br />
                                    <br /> The camera pulls back further to full show the pair at their table. narine_do_douce is a French-viet woman who wears a green halter top while her friend wears an orange t-shirt and jeans while smoking. The friend's shoulder-length brown hair is pushed loosely behind her ears, with a wisp falling along her cheek. <br />
                                    <br /> "Maybe that's because he sucks in bed?" The friend offers sympathetically with a half-smile, her cigarette smoke curling up and over her shoulder. <br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce smiles but then becomes downcast as she replies, "But, it's not just him. It's with every guy."<br />
                                    <br /> The friend looks at her with concern. <br />
                                    <br /> In a flashback, we join narine_do_douce in a different bedroom. A string of decorative mini-ball lantern lights glows in the low light, strung loosely across the wall. narine_do_douce sits on the bed with her knees drawn up on either side of her with a small round mirror braced between her feet and angled so she can see her vulva, which is obscured from us by her exploring hands. She only wears a bra and looks upset at the mirror as her hands probe around. <br />
                                    <br /> Present-day narine_do_douce's reply to her friend in the bar reads, "It's been 2 years since I'd done anything remotely sexual. I think I'm just not suited for sex. I can't even get a finger in!"<br />
                                    <br /> The flashback narine_do_douce with the mirror on the bed grumbles, "Argh, fuck!"<br />
                                    <br /> Returned to the present day in the bar, her friend gently points a finger at her, suggesting, "Or maybe you have vaginismus. You should look it up!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Back in the bedroom with the light string, narine_do_douce sits fully clothed on her floor with a cup of tea by her side against a cluster of seating pillows. She is looking in surprise at the laptop balanced on her crossed legs. <br />
                                    <br /> "Vaginismus." Her laptop informs her. "Vaginismus is when the vagina suddenly tightens up when you try to insert something into it. It can be painful and upsetting, but it can be treated."<br />
                                    <br /> Electrified, an extra-cartoonishly simplified icon of narine_do_douce explodes as she's struck by lightening as she realizes, "SEX CAN FEEL ?!"<br />
                                    <br /> Flashing back to a memory, she glares at a former companion who smiles oafishly at her while making the OK sign with one hand and with the other inserting his pointer finger into the hole. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Suddenly, I felt very angry at all of my past partners, who only focused on penetrative sex.<br />
                                    <br /> Standing triumphantly with her hands on her hips and a soft breeze blowing her long hair, the narration explains, "I got diagnosed pretty fast."<br />
                                    <br /> "It's you and me against the world baby!" She announces, wearing jeans and a t-shirt. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yell yeah." Her crotch announces through her jeans. <br />
                                    <br /> The view shifts to her fridge door with cute magnets holding up phots and various handwritten notes, like her grocery list and another one titled, "TODAY" which lists, <br /> "-Call mom<br /> -laundry<br /> -Annoy everyone by talking about vaginsmus 24/7"<br />
                                    <br /> Out in a grassy field with speckles of colorful flowers, narine_do_douce lays on her back with her limbs starfished out. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Speaking about it was my way of coming to terms with years of sexual anguish. Despite having supportive friends, I needed something else. <br />
                                    <br /> Close by her head, we see the peachy-yellow sky from her vantage point with soft clouds lazily rolling by. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I needed community.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Narration: I found a Facebook group of vaginsmus patients of my age. <br />
                                    <br /> The landing page of that group is displayed with a header graphic reading, "NO TABOOS" across three different nude torsos of various skin tones and shapes. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: A whole new world opened. <br />
                                    <br /> On the Facebook page, a conversation unfolds. <br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce's text box: I kinda don't want dilators...<br />
                                    <br /> Tanya's text box: Totes! What are you planning then? :)<br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce adds a heart icon to Tanya's text and replies with a selfie of her giving a daring, mischievous look straight into the camera as she holds up both bands in front of her face, displaying the pointer and ring fingers dramatically, like hand-pistols pointing straight up and framing her face. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: We were here for each other in our shared journey. <br />
                                    <br /> Back on the field, real life narine_do_douce still reclines on her back but is now joined by blue representations of her online friends, who also lay on their backs with her. They create a circle with their heads closer together and their bodies radiating outwards. <br />
                                    <br /> Their blue chat text boxes hover around them as they converse, several with reaction icons added to them. <br />
                                    <br /> Tanya: This one looks like my dildo! [heart reaction added by a friend]<br />
                                    <br /> Leo: Oh Tanya! [Devil emoji added by a friend]<br />
                                    <br /> Sam: Reminds me of my ex lmaooo<br />
                                    <br /> Lucy: [Three cry-laughing emojis in a row]<br />
                                    <br /> Chris: [Cry-laughing emoji and two laughing emojis]<br />
                                    <br /> Cruising along in a pink convertible with the top down, narine_do_douce joyfully explains, "Talking, laughing, crying, joking about vaginismus with the group felt so empower." Her blue digital friends throw their hands in the air as the wind wips their hair and clothes around them. "But in real life..."<br />
                                    <br /> Still in the driver's seat, but now somber and alone, narine_do_douce continues, "I was still struggling alone."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narration: And then, a friend confided in me.<br />
                                    <br /> Over text, a friend asks,<br /> Iris: Hey, you have vaginismus right? Can we talk? Really struggling rn...<br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce: I'm on my way &lt;3!<br />
                                    <br /> Pulling up to her friend in her pink convertible, narine_do_douce announces, "Hop in, bestie!"<br />
                                    <br /> The pair joyously roar off down the coastline freeway, past a helpful signpost with one arrow-shaped sign pointing to the left and reading, "Public restrooms", while the other sparkles with stars, pointing to the right and reading, "Road to pleasure!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And this lonely path became a friends' road trip! <br />
                                    <br /> A collection of travel photos and postcards cascades across the panel. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Healing with Iris was the best. We were there in real life for every milestone.<br /> Adjusting her sunhat at a jaunty angle, the friend poses for a close-up with the text, "It's Sunny in Wet-[obscured]" stamped in the corner in a funky font. <br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce and her friend sit serenely and leaning against each other on a big rock in a field of grass with a cave entrance behind them. In cursive, it is captioned, "Acceptance Cavern"<br />
                                    <br /> The friend poses with her fingers in peace signs in front of a beachside location sign reading, "ORGASM CAP"<br />
                                    <br /> Arm in arm, the friends pose triumphantly in front of a waterfall with a location sign declaring, "LUBE CASCADE"<br />
                                    <br /> "Hi from Confidence Bay!" Reads the final postcard, which shows the pair with their arms thrown around the others' shoulders and making big goof smiles in front of a sun setting at a beach. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: From learning about lube to our first sex-positive relationships. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Narration: A year later, we were in a much better spot. <br />
                                    <br /> With her luggage planted outside of the pink convertible, her friend stands on the pavement, leaning over the top as she happily tells narine_do_douce, "Thanks for the trip." <br />
                                    <br /> "Love you!" narine_do_douce replies from her spot behind the driver's wheel. <br />
                                    <br /> From overhead in a new bedroom, we see narine_do_douce entangled joyously with a partner on a rumpled bed. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Also, I had sex again. It was a blast.<br />
                                    <br /> At a sex shop's window, a variety of toys and underwear are on display. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It's now 6 years later. <br />
                                    <br /> Someone's voice asks, "Which one guys?" <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I'm much more confident and open about my sexual hardships. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Vaginismus was the root of a lot of struggles. <br />
                                    <br /> narine_do_douce stands on the sidewalk with her friend as they scope out the toys on display. The blue online friends stand with them. <br />
                                    <br /> The friend declares, "The pink one!" <br />
                                    <br /> "You sure ?" Asks narine_do_douce. "Leo says the batter is awful."<br />
                                    <br /> Sam's text box in blue offers, "I have the wand, it's... something!" [A heart reaction is added]<br />
                                    <br /> Leo's blue text book adds, "The rabbit one! Amaziiing." [A hear reaction is added]<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But, through healing and learning about... I grew more than I could have ever hoped for.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Critical Hit by Shyle Zalewski, published April 8, 2025 on OhJoySexToy.com<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br />
                                    <br /> Shyle Zalewski draws in a very rounded cartoony style with strong, textured ink lines. Sections of the environments are shaded with a halftone dot screen and the overall color palette is soft yellows, browns, and oranges, but that switches to a vibrant pink for the fantasy elements. <br />
                                    <br /> In a bustling house party, Shyle stands against a wall alone, holding a drink. The scene is set in yellow tones. She is an arty queer person with messy hair and giant glasses. <br />
                                    <br /> " What a disappointing party." Shyle grouses to herself. "This is the last time I go to one of these boring and pretentious exhibitions. Look at all these NPCs right here. Pretty all the same."<br />
                                    <br /> In her imagination, bright pink character profile cards pop up, listing the statistics of:<br />
                                    <br /> Henri Clavel, a smug blond medieval-esque warrior<br /> Class: Paladin<br /> Hobby: Killing Dragons<br /> Likes: Money<br />
                                    <br /> Louis Grand, who wears the exact same outfit but has shorter hair and a more awkward smile.<br /> Class: Paladin<br /> Hobby: Killing orcs<br /> Likes: Gold<br />
                                    <br /> Jacques Dubus, yet another fellow in the same outfit but he has a mustache and a big smile. <br /> Class: Paladin<br /> Hobby: Killing Goblins<br /> Likes: Banks<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Back into the yellow-hued reality at the part, Shyle does a double-take as she takes a drink, spotting something across the room. "Uh...? I may have spoken too soon. I think I see a different kind of character here."<br />
                                    <br /> From her perspective, we see Matt, a cute nerd with tinted hair.<br />
                                    <br /> "Well," She thinks to herself. "he's cute and seems funny... Plus he's wearing a Dungeons &amp; Dragons shirt."<br />
                                    <br /> A pink stat box appears next to him, reading:<br /> "Matt Coton<br /> Class: Archer<br /> Hobby: Ukulele<br /> Likes: Gaming" <br />
                                    <br /> Another pink "Start the Game" button appears next to him, festooned with a little witch's hat and a bow and arrow. A giant white arrow cursor clicks it. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Matt, still in the yellow party, smiles at the reader, unaware of the imaginary pink options window that's appeared across the bottom of the panel. It gives the options:<br /> "Start a conversation.<br /> A: Wassup duuude?!!<br /> B: (Awkward Silence)<br /> C: My butt is all yours.<br /> D: So, you're into D&amp;D" --Which is the one that the arrow cursor clicks.<br />
                                    <br /> Shyle and Matt launch into an animated conversation depicted through pink pictograms in word balloons. The pink image-word balloons include a treasure map, an angry orc face, a castle, crossed swords, a fire ball, a shield, and a star. They shine against the yellow backdrop of the party.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> "Dang!" Shyle thinks, looking flustered. "His stats are SO high! I feel like a newbie." <br />
                                    <br /> Matt smiles sweetly, oblivious to Shyle's assessment. In pink, his stats pop up in an information box next to him (who is still in yellow tones):<br /> Charisma: lvl 45<br /> Intell: lvl 50<br /> Hotness lvl 90<br />
                                    <br /> "Ok, let's try this." She thinks to herself with an eager/nervous smile. Then gesturing to a door, she says aloud, "This place sucks. Wanna go out for a drink?" as she discreetly rolls two imaginary pink dice.<br />
                                    <br /> All in bright pink, an explosive caption box announces, "SUCCESS!! Your awkwardness makes you funny and kinda safe." Two giant pink 20-sided dice roll up with an 18 and a 20. <br />
                                    <br /> In pink, an caption box that looks weathered like an old piece of parchment reads, "MATT is joining the team!" with little pink stars sparkling around Matt, who is still in yellow and brown tones. "Ok!" He cheerily agrees. <br />
                                    <br /> "Everything is expensive around here, would you prefer to go to my home? I live 200 feet away." He offers to Shyle, who blushes and smiles flirtatiously in response. <br />
                                    <br /> In pink, another explosive caption box announces, "NEW QUEST UPDATE!!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> Now outside a new yellow-toned door with an arrow-adorned shield mounted on it, a pink old-timey scroll explains, "Next Level: The Archer's House."<br />
                                    <br /> Inside Matt's apartment, the two lose no time as they begin making out, still standing in the middle of the entryway. A pink caption announces, "SPEED ATTACK!!"<br />
                                    <br /> Confidently, Shyle announces, "...My turn to play, now." to Matt, who smiles lustily back at her. <br />
                                    <br /> A tattered pink parchment narrates, "The Witch Takes Off: Clothes" followed by a stat window with the information,<br /> "-10 Armor<br /> -5 Warmth<br /> +56 Sluttiness" <br />
                                    <br /> A pink thermometer "Desire Gauge" appears next to yellow-toned Matt, who sits on the bed in the background looking a little flustered as he watches Shyle pull off her underwear while standing in the foreground. With her butt to us, she balances on one leg as she deftly maneuvers the underwear over her lifted ankle. <br />
                                    <br /> Grinning a blushing, Matt ventures, "You know, I'm not used to inviting people to my place so fast. But... you were..." <br />
                                    <br /> "...Bewitching?" Shyle finishes for him, returning a mischievously horny grin. <br />
                                    <br /> "Can I teleport myself down here?" Asks Shyle as she drops out of sight from the panel, the top of her head indicating that she is right at dick-level with Matt- who, in turn, looks surprised and flustered as he blushes. <br />
                                    <br /> A pink scroll declares, "Effect on Archer: STUNNED!"<br />
                                    <br /> "OoooOOOOOOH..." Matt moans as Shyle goes to town with her mouth on his cock, which is annotated with helpful "Suck! Suck! Suck!" sound effects. <br />
                                    <br /> "...Mmmmh." She purrs to herself as she sucks away. "As a witch, it's what I call a freakin' MAGIC WAND!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Flipping her around so she leans over the bed, Matt smacks her ass while declaring, "Slow down, you slutty witch, that's way too good, haha!" <br />
                                    <br /> In pink, the caption explodes with the text, "Archer Special Skill, 'buttdiving'", which is displayed helpfully over Matt burying his face between Shyle's cheeks. <br />
                                    <br /> The pink scroll explains, "It's super effective!" over Shyle's sex-drunk face. <br />
                                    <br /> "OoOOooh! Do that forever plz..." She drools to the sounds of Matt licking away on her ass. <br />
                                    <br /> "The witch cast an ancient spell:" A pink scroll narrates over Shyle blushing as she removes her glasses, looking back over her shoulder at Matt. <br />
                                    <br /> "Now... Encule-moi!" She declares in cursive. <br />
                                    <br /> A pink scroll unfurls, recounting the message, "In an old mysterious language called "French", it means: FUCK MY ASS. -en is for "putting in", -cule, for "cul", is "butt/ass", -moi is for "me"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> A large pink arrow flies overhead with the caption, "Entering the dungeon: 67%" above our couple who are totally doin' it doggy-style. Shyle's face is flushed pink against the rest of the yellow-tones of the panel. <br />
                                    <br /> A "HAA!" rings out in pink explosive letters over an illustration of a butt-like peach with the feathered end of an arrow sticking out between its mounds. "It's in!" The peach shouts triumphantly. <br />
                                    <br /> As Matt plows Shyle the panel fills with the sound of yellow "CLAP! CLAP! CLAP!" sound effects and pink "+99EXP" points. <br />
                                    <br /> The two collapse into bed, sweaty, exhausted, and satisfied. They pant and blush as their blood pressure settles. <br />
                                    <br /> "The witch evolves into: Happy Witch" announces a pink parchment over Matt as Shyle nestles her contented face against his shoulder. <br />

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ripley gets brave, and attends Size Con with the team! A piece of autobio, journalism and kink, all mixed into one, and a fun way to see some of the process behind OJST&amp;#8217;s first group outing. A shout out to Editor Ziggy helped make this one happen this week. He helped write the early pages [&amp;#8230;]</summary>

                        <p>Ripley gets <strong>brave</strong>, and attends <a href="https://sizecon.com/" target="_blank">Size Con</a> with the team! A piece of autobio, journalism and kink, all mixed into one, and a fun way to see some of the process behind OJST’s first group outing.</p>
                        <p>A shout out to Editor Ziggy helped make this one happen this week. He helped write the early pages and we’re all really proud of how it shaped out.</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Ripley LaCross draws in a simplified-realistic cartoon-ish style, using a color palette of white and purples with soft dark grey pencil lines. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> From behind, we see Ripley working at their digital art setup with two illuminated screens propped up on their desk in front of them. In one hand Ripley holds a stylus with an extra chunky finger cushion and in the other they're checking their phone, which loudly pings at them. We can faintly hear music playing from Ripley's over-ear thick black headphones. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley's hair is bushy with the sides shaved down to stubble, making a relaxed mohawk or dapper mullet. They wear a black blazer over their collared blue shirt, with black pants and boots, with skinny glasses topping them off. They sport various facial and ear piercings along with a hint of mustache and beard against their white skin tone. <br />
                                    <br /> Matt Nolan's profile picture appears next to his text message that appears on Ripley's phone. He is the Big Boss of Oh Joy Sex Toy and one of the two comics editors. "Hey, team!" Matt's text announces. "The organizers at SizeCon reached out to ask if we're interested in going! It's being held in Portland this year. Any interest? https://sizecon.com/<br />
                                    <br /> Ziggy is the other comic editor and his profile picture, including his dog Elivra, appears next to his text response, "[Three eyeballs emojis in a row] That's a giant YES fro me!"<br />
                                    <br /> Biting their finger nervously, Ripley muses to themself, "...I can't even go into a toy shop without wanting to implode..." and then types into the group chat, "Oooh! [eyeballs emoji] ...Maybe?? Not really my flavor of kink... I've never been to a show like that, either."<br />
                                    <br /> "It'll be so fun!!" Ziggy quickly texts. "Art! Vendors! Workshops! Demonstrations! Community-building socials!"<br />
                                    <br /> Aloud, Ripley ponders, "Oh my god, demos, too??"<br />
                                    <br /> For a tense moment, we zoom in on Ripley's face as it seriously considers their phone as if it were a bomb needing to be diffused. <br />
                                    <br /> Pulled back again, we see just Ripley's finger decisively press down on their phone, sending the text message, "I'm in!"<br />
                                    <br /> "YESSS! OJST FIELD TRIP!!!" Ziggy immediately texts back.<br />
                                    <br /> Pulled back further still, Ripley gingerly holds their phone in one hand as they cradle their head in the other, asking aloud, "...I hope I don't regret this..."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> A calendar page for February flutters on the wall, showing that SizeCon was three weeks away but the hatch mark across each day's box shows us that time has passed and that date is now today.<br />
                                    <br /> "Ziggggyyy!!" Ripley's private chat text reads. "My tummy hurts just thinking about the show today &gt;_&lt;"<br />
                                    <br /> "Liiiiiiiike you swallowed a bunch of tiny people, oor..." Ziggy's text teases back.<br />
                                    <br /> "Ping!" announces the group chat as Matt's message comes through, "On my way! to pick you up, Ripley!" <br />
                                    <br /> Back in the private chat to Ziggy, Ripley resumes, "... Ziggy no. I'm just so bad in crowds?? And strangers and sexy stuff and... kink... I'M JUST AN AWKWARD LITTLE GUY." A chibi version of himself appears next to his text, sweating and fretting with cartoonishly oversized sweat drops. <br />
                                    <br /> Chibi Ziggy appears next to his own chat reply. He has a short scruffy shock of hair on the top of his head with the sides shaved, and sports big round glasses, guaged ears, and a sparse mustache. Devilishly, he holds up a small animal safety vest labeled, "NERVOUS" as he replies, "What if we got you a NERVOUS DOG harness?"<br />
                                    <br /> "LMAO if only" Chibi Ripley answers, before leaning in closer to examine the vest, musing to themself, "...hmmm maybe?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Well today is the slowest day of the show, so it shouldn't even be all that crowded!" Chibi Ziggy continues. "And tbh everyone always wats to talk to Erika anyway, so you may be able to get away with just lurking!"<br />
                                    <br /> A relieved Chibi Ripley answers, "Our social savior [prayer emoji hands] You're probably right! It'll be fine."<br />
                                    <br /> "Ping!" goes the group chat as Matt texts, "BTW! Erika's not feeling great so she's sitting this one out."<br />
                                    <br /> "Balls." Thinks Chibi Ripley, looking at their phone blankly.<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley's normally-drawn face timidly peeks into an empty panel, show sweat rolling down their forehead as they say to themself, "...what if I say I'm sick...?"<br />
                                    <br /> Then, breaking free of panel borders, we see the top half of Ripley radiating manufactured confidence as they announce, "NO. You made a commitment! You're gonna be cool, and chill, and confident, and FINE!"<br />
                                    <br /> "...Right?" Ripley thinks to themself outside of the convention center, seeing the other patrons walking into the unassuming building. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Inside the building, all of the OJST crew wears N95 masks, though very few of the other attendees or exhibitors do. Ziggy is in the process of putting on their attendee badge from the check-in table while Ripley is being handed their own. Attendees mill around, entering through a part in some thick black curtains that form a temporary wall. Tentatively, Ripley pulls back a curtain panel, peeking their face through to see what lays on the other side. <br />
                                    <br /> Framed between the parted black curtains, Ripley recoils in horror at the claustrophobic cluster of preview bubbles containing snapshots of scenes from around the con. There are LOTS of people. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley's thoughts flock around their head, panic-thinking, "Oh. Oh no, it's so cramped. Why does it feel louder than it actually is? I feel like prey. Keep moving. Don't stand still. Oh wow, people really like my vest. Crap, am I leering? What am I doing??"<br />
                                    <br /> "Last call for the Ace Social!" a voice cuts through the pandemonium. <br />
                                    <br /> Panic-sweating, Ripley takes this opportunity to zip out the open door to the announced meeting. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> From behind Ripley, we see a large circle of people sitting in folding chairs. The others are cast in light while Ripley is starkly in shadow, with the helpful caption, "Realizing they don't know what a 'Social' even is."<br />
                                    <br /> Our view pivots overhead as Ripley sits down in an open chair, showing us a diverse assortment of people sitting in the circle. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Social: A casual gathering for the purpose of conversation.<br />
                                    <br /> "Out of the pan and into the fire, I guess." Ripley thinks to themself with some nervous forehead sweating. <br />
                                    <br /> Snippets of people's introductions float by various attendees who are drawn to keep their identities obscurred. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hi, I'm [---] and I've known I'm asexual since my teen years...]" Says one person, while another explains, "It all started when my grandma showed me Honey, I Shrunk The Kids..." A timid person volunteers, "Being gay has meant I'm expected to be hypersexual, but... I'm not."<br />
                                    <br /> Finally Ripley introduces themself, saying, "H-hi, I'm Ripley. they/he. And... I realized I'm Asexual just a few years ago... turns out that I wasn't actually sexually attracted to my crushes: I just had gender envy..." <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> At the end of the Social as people are leaving the circle, another attendee approaches Ripley, asking, "What did you mean by 'gender envy?'"<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!" Replies Ripley, looking much more comfortable than before. "It's like... a deep attraction to how they presented their gender, and I'd wished I could do the same..."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It takes me a long time to get comfortable with anyone. Multiply the number of people (and sprinkle in some deeply personal topics) and I'll freeze to the point of pain.<br />
                                    <br /> Rejoining Matt and Ziggy on the crowded floor, Ripley says a little sheepishly, "Hey guys, what's up? Sorry I disappeared!"<br />
                                    <br /> "No worries!" Ziggy replies with a laugh. "Wanna meet another OJST artist?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Sure!" Ripley enthuses. <br />
                                    <br /> At DarkChibi Shadow's merchandise table, Ziggy gives a double thumbs up to the artist while Ripley gives a friendly but nervous wave hello. DarkChibi Shadow has short dark hair, glasses, and wears a dark N95 mask covering most of their face. The vibes are good amongst them all.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But as it turns out, social ice breakers actually work! (I know, shocker!!) Most people are shy and awkward in public. So why not just be awkward together?<br />
                                    <br /> The view pulls back showing the OJST team chatting away with DarkChibi Shadow at their table, comfortably embedded in the busy convention hall with other exhibitors at their tables and attendees milling around. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: A moment of discomfort is worth a lifetime of rewards. <br />
                                    <br /> Matt's chat text appears with a "PING!", saying "Hey gang! PDX KinkFest is next month... [smirking emoji face]"<br />
                                    <br /> "Hell yeah, count me in!" replies Ripley's text. <br />

                        <p>This is a perfect introduction for a new reader to find out just what the heck this thing is and it’s a fascinating peek behind the curtain for how this all comes together for folks who already follow the comics each week. This is such a loving, revealing tour around the world of <em>Oh Joy Sex Toy</em> and the many different people who produce it <em>and</em> read it.</p>
                        <h2>
                            <strong>Part Two: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/community-defense-podcast/05b-drawing-resilience-from-sex-positivity">Drawing Resilience from Sex Positivity</a>

                        </h2>
                        <p>This follow-up really gets into the meat of our tiny comics production house and the challenges we face, both for our creative contributors and for us as a company from the public. Staff artist <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/hienpham">Hien Pham</a> shares how he navigates our editorial needs while trying to remain true to the stories he actually wants to tell. As a sex-positive publishing house, it continues to be harder and harder to exist on the Mainstream Internet as riffraff like us are forced off social media and face a volatile political landscape. Plus: Creators Matt and Erika are just plum getting old!</p>
                        <p>It is the passion and support of OJST’s creators and audience that keeps it afloat. Please give a listen to our actual readers, contributors, and creators in their own words in this candid look behind the scenes at what it means to keep <em>Oh Joy Sex Toy</em> alive and thriving.</p>
                        <p>Thank you so much to all of our readers and contributors who called in to share their thoughts and feelings about this decade+ long sex-positive comic project, and thank you to <a href="https://matv3i.carrd.co">Matvei Mozhaev</a> for pouring in the research and hours to make this episode for <a href="https://www.wortfm.org/news-talk/talk/queery">Queery on the radio station WORT 89.9 fm</a>.</p>

Massive thank-you to WA-PAH for putting on a lovely party! I’ve always felt their welcoming embrace, and I hope this love letter can express my gratitude. Funnily enough, it was an <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/puppyplay-alex-r/">OJST comic from 8 years ago</a> that first piqued my interest in the Pups, and now I’m contributing to the Pups comics catalogue!</p>
                        <p>Dear reader, if there’s a Pups &amp; Handlers club near you, I’d highly recommend reaching out and attending your local events. First-timers might find socializing difficult, but I’d wager you can say hi to one of the organizers and they’d likely be very happy to introduce you to the scene!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Kennel Club Vol. 2 by Hien Pham, published March 25, 2025 for ohjoysextoy.com<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Hien Pham illustrates his comic with a simplified realistic style with lovingly rendered hair details that sweep along his characters like waves on the ocean. While the coloring on the figures is more flat, the textures and reflections on their leather, neoprene, and spandex outfits are rendered much more realistically. He uses a full spectrum of colors. <br />
                                    <br /> A close-up panel shows two hands rubbing a clear liquid across the chest of a person wearing a tight black tanktop-like fetish top with a zipper going down the middle. The thick latex material reflects the light.<br />
                                    <br /> "So... what does this do?" Asks the voice attached to the massaging hands. "Lubing up your suit?" <br />
                                    <br /> The next panel pulls back to reveal Hien Pham squirting another splash of lube onto Clay's latex vest. A thick blue strip runs down the side of the top under his armpit, which is exposed because he holds both his hands behind his masked head. The blue dog ears and muzzle of the mask match the stripe on the vest, in addition to yellow accents.<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!" Exclaims Clay, looking downwards at Hien as he works in the lube to his chest. "Silicone lube gives latex its shine!"<br />
                                    <br /> Clay's latex-clad belly sparkles in the light as Hien runs a lube-y hand over it. Hien is a Southeast Asian cisgender heavyset man with a short, bushy, black beard, fuzzy body hair, and glasses. He is mostly bald on top, with the rest of his hair pulled back into a proud bun. He wears a cross-back leather harness that connects to his shorts like suspenders.<br />
                                    <br /> "It also keeps the suit from drying out and cracking!" Continues Clay as Hien rubs in lube between his thighs. "Plus, it's quite fun and intimate too! Don't you think?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah, I definite do think!" Hien replies cheekily with a blush from between Clay's legs.<br />
                                    <br /> Another person enters the room carrying their own bottle of lube, asking, "Clay, can you get my back?" The new person wears a sleeveless black top and a thick industrial chain with a padlock around their neck. They have a short, trimmed beard and mustache, with an undercut hairstyle that's shorter on the sides than the top. <br />
                                    <br /> "I can do it!" Hien volunteers, holding up his hand which drips lube. "My hands are already slick!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Last month, I went to the Western Australia Pups and Handlers' first social even of 2025: Kennel Club Vol. 2!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page two<br /> Narration: The event was held on a Sunday afternoon on the top floor of Connections Nightclub, the longest-running gay club in the southern hemisphere!<br />
                                    <br /> The page is filled with an angled top-down view of a brick building with a transparent roof, revealing the rooms and inhabitants within. The artwork transitions from the realistic style to a simplified, cartoon-y one, depicting all the people as short chibi versions of themselves. Many people wear fetish pup masks, which are a very stylized, almost cartoonish kind of hood made of a thick material like leather, neoprene, or spandex-- they are not realistic to real dogs at all and there is no fur on them. <br />
                                    <br /> Throughout the building, the various areas are labeled:<br /> -Entrance!<br /> -Terrace and smoking area!<br /> -Performance and announcement stage! (part of the outdoor terrace, with disco balls)<br /> -Little hide-away cuddle cove with cushy seats!<br /> -Charcuterie boards with lollies and snacks!<br /> -Open bar!<br /> -Padded mosh area with dog toys!<br /> -Informal changing room and bag drop.<br /> -toilets. <br />
                                    <br /> One chibi person without a hood on checks their phone while sitting on the terrace while two hooded people dance. Inside the cuddle cove, a couple dances- one wearing a mask and the other bare-faced but wearing their 2023 Mr. Bear titleholder sash with orange, yellow, white, and black color squares. A hooded person on their knees gleefully chomps on a tennis ball in the padded mosh area, while other folks mill about the rest of the building areas. In the kitchen area, the International Puppy &amp; Trainer Contest titleholder parties in a blue leather sash and a black, yellow, and orange pup hood.<br />
                                    <br /> Page three<br /> The art reverts back to Hien's more realistic style on this page. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: There was no show, no exhibition. This was simply a space where like-minded folks could wear gear, and enjoy each other's queer company. <br />
                                    <br /> "Aroo! Good to see you!" Greats a person in an orange pup hood, wearing their regular human glasses over the mask. They have a matching thick orange collar around their neck and an open blue button-down shirt revealing their bare chest and belly beneath. Affectionately, they nudge Hien's shoulder with their muzzle. <br />
                                    <br /> "Good to se you too!" Replies Hien who is cooling himself with a pleated purple hand fan. "How are you going?" <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The crowd welcomed pups and handlers, as well as allies and all those curious. <br />
                                    <br /> A glimpse of the party-goers are shown talking with each other. One person has bushy hair, a hoop pierced ear, a green thick collar, and a black fetish vest. They talk with a person in a giant mascot tiger head and paws and another person with long brown hair, latex top, and pink furry kitty ears. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: There was a variety of kinky equipment on display: leather, rubber, latex, the lot! Many were in everyday clothes, too!<br />
                                    <br /> A variety of fetish accoutrements are worn by partygoers, including  colorful strap-on silicone tails (that look like they may double as penetration toys, perhaps?) and a blue leather flogger that's clipped to a belt. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The atmosphere was whimsical and affectionate. It wasn't hard to find yourself in casual conversations about any given niche that makes someone tick. <br />
                                    <br /> Two people bump their muzzles together, nose-to-nose. On wears a full brown, yellow, and black pup mask leaving only their bushy brown top hair and beard tumbling out from the top and bottom. The other person wears just a muzzle over their nose and mouth that is made of dark and light blue, with a light blue collar around their neck to match. <br />
                                    <br /> In the background, a person in a black, purple, and yellow full pup hood chats with Hien. <br />
                                    <br /> "...so I tied a simple cuff, then got them on their knees, and pulled their hands toward their feet!" The person explains to Hien, bumping their purple-cuffed wrists together to illustrate their point. <br />
                                    <br /> "That's free real estate for wedgies right there!" Hien replies, confidently bapping his shoulder with his closed fan. <br />
                                    <br /> Now fluttering his fan in front of his face, the narration reads, "The demographic skewed younger than the Bears I was used to, and sometimes, when the music got too loud, my social anxiety got in my head, and I felt so incredibly out of place."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Four<br /> Narration: A skill I've learned over the years is how to find a good quiet corner to recharge in. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien sits down into an empty couch, fanning himself. Partially drained glasses and snacks sit in the foreground. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Somewhere I can close my eyes, hold my hands, and sit with my feelings for a little while. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien takes a calming breath with his eyes closed. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Oftentimes, friends and folks looking for the same peace and quiet would come over to join me. <br />
                                    <br /> From Hien's point of view, we see his hands in his lap, with his closed fan resting on the top of his left leg. One hand tightly squeezes his other hand's thumb until a voice interrupts-<br /> "Hien!"<br />
                                    <br /> The camera pulls back again to reveal a short-haired blonde person with a busy mustache sitting down on the couch's backrest to look down at Hien. <br />
                                    <br /> "You okay?" The blonde person asks jovially. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah. I'm okay." Replies Hien, suddenly pulled back to reality. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I've been trying to shift from dwelling on my anxiety to acknowledging how people have made an active effort to be in my company. When it works, that little change in mindset helps center me back into the present.<br />
                                    <br /> Now with enthusiasm, Hien invites his friend to "Come sit and cuddle with me!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Okay!" The friend agrees, sliding down to sit with Hien. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Five<br /> A full mask in dark and light brown pops up between Hien and his friend from behind the couch.<br /> "What are you guys talking about?" The new pup asks, throwing their arms over the shoulders of Hien and his friend. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh hello!" Chirps the blonde person in their open black leather vest and bare chest exposed beneath. <br />
                                    <br /> "The Substance!" Hien answers the new person's question. "Have you seen? It's so good!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I'm so grateful for these events that remove pressure, expectations, and shame from queer existence. <br />
                                    <br /> A person in a fantastical dragon-type red and black hood offers up a platter of fancy drinks (or... some kind of ice cream scoops over ice?) to a person in a rainbow colored muzzle and a leather crown with stripes in Pups Pride flag colors of white, blue, and black.<br />
                                    <br /> "Shark-bari!" Shouts a muzzled person in another area of the party as Hien proudly displays his stuffed shark that is bound up in shibari ropes. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: These spaces build communities when we need to stand together the most. In celebration, and persistence. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I might not fancy myself a pup or a handler, at least not yet...<br />
                                    <br /> Hien and some partygoers pose as a voice calls from off-panel, "Three, two, one-"<br />
                                    <br /> "AROOO!!" Howls the trio as they flex and strike a pose for the photographer. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But getting to witness my friends' joy feels no less than a privilege. <br />
                                    <br /> "You're off?" Asks a friend in a full pup hood as they hug Hien.<br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah, I'm so tired..." Hien groggily replies. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Kennel Club filled my heart to the brim, and I cannot wait for the next event in May!<br />
                                    <br /> In a conga line, chibi-fied versions of Hien and two more friends run to the edge of the page, arranged tallest to shortest (Hien).<br />
                                    <br /> "Let's get dumplings!" Declares the tallest friend.<br />
                                    <br /> "Yas!!" Hien concurs, leading the line. <br /> Transcribed by Erika Moen on March 24, 2025 for ohjoysextoy.com<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">A Night at the Atlantic Sex Show by Inam, published 3/18/2025 for ohjoysextoy.com<br />
                                    <br /> Inam draws in a loose, almost-sketchy simplified style. The color palette is blues, pinks, and oranges with black line work. <br />
                                    <br /> Inam is a bug-eyed girl wearing a bat-earned hood. She energetically points at her phone while making intense eye contact with the reader, saying, "When I was in Halifax in February, I went to opening night at the Atlantic Sex Show!" Zipper up her winter parker, she continues, "It's a sexy convention... in the middle of winter." while snow blows around her. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I've always illustrated stories about sex and kink, but it's only in the last year I've started to realise I can actually try doing some of the stuff I've drawn. <br />
                                    <br /> She trudges through the knee-high snow, her feet making crunching noises with each step. She walks in the direction of an "ASS" sandwich board sign. <br />
                                    <br /> "Why did I wear all these layers... She wonders as she pushes open the door to the convention building. Sweat drips down her face. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh, they have a coat rack." She observes and then notices another person removing their heavy winter coat to reveal sexy black underwear beneath. "OH! I could have worn a sexy outfit!"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: (Most people wore regular street clothes though)<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I'm also nosy and wanted to see how other erotic artists make a living. <br />
                                    <br /> Inam wanders through the convention hall with her n95 mask secured over her nose and mouth. She walks by tables and booths with their wares on display. A giant bracelet with heart beads floats overhead next to two art prints, one of a fox and the other a fairy.<br />
                                    <br /> "Handmade jewelry... Nature and plants... Surprisingly normal?" Inam pulls aside their mask to sample some freeze dried candy from a jar, asking themself, "why"<br />
                                    <br /> Peeking into a dark room, Inam peers over the shoulder of a person drawing on a big paper pad, their subject a nude model reclining on a fainting couch. "Live life drawing!" She thinks to herself. "Impressive!"<br />
                                    <br /> Squinting at her phone, she thinks to herself, "OK I have GOT to find this dungeon or I'm going to miss these demos! There's going to be fire, ropes, and something called the VacCube?!!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Two<br /> She exits an elevator, thinking, "Found it."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: In my head, I guess I pictured a kink demo like this: There'd probably be a stage and someone would narrate everything.<br />
                                    <br /> In her imagination, we see a brightly lit stage with a presenter wearing a tuxedo addressing the audience. The presenter gestures at the couple on the stage with a pointer in one hand and speaks confidently into the microphone in their other hand. To their side is a sandwich board holding up scientific-looking diagrams. On stage, a larger person kneels with their pants dropped, no top on, and a bondage mask covering their head. Another person pauses in the middle of flogging the kneeling person. They, too, wear a bondage mask (but with pig tails), fancy underwear, and thigh-high boots. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But actually, it's more like..." <br />
                                    <br /> The scene shifts to darker lighting. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Laughing! <br />
                                    <br /> A person dressed business casual flogs another person who is topless and attached at the wrists to a giant X structure. The bound person is blindfolded and laughing as the flogger SMACKs against their back. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Talking!<br />
                                    <br /> A handful of people chat against a wall in a room. One person is dressed business casual and waves to someone off panel. A person dressed in a t-shirt and jeans sits in a wheelchair, chatting with someone dressed in a cheerleader outfit. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Sentimental upbeat folk music? <br />
                                    <br /> Two giant speakers play music on a stage. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Clapping!<br />
                                    <br /> A large audience applauds and cheers from bleachers, including Inam. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Three<br /> From the bleachers, Inam is transfixed by something happening on the stage as she thinks to herself, "Woah, they're using fire! I want to take a look... Can I?" <br />
                                    <br /> "hi" Inam greets the people in a demo area with a friendly wave.<br />
                                    <br /> "hi" each of the three people greets her in return. Their demo area is cordoned off with velvet ropes and giant curtains cascade down in the background. On person sits on the demonstration table wearing only star-shaped pasties, underwear, and knee-high baggy socks. Another person stands by the table wearing a short dress, glasses, and a badge on a lanyard. The third person wears a collared shirt and slacks, standing behind the table. <br />
                                    <br /> In a different area with its own velvet rope, a person wearing thigh-high boots and little else greets their friend with a "You made it!" The friend waves back, wearing jeans, a long-sleeved striped top, and carrying their purse in hand. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I was struck by how talkative and relaxed everyone was with each other. <br />
                                    <br /> Back to the demonstration table, the person who was sitting on it is now laying on their belly, leaving their back exposed as the demonstrator in the collared shirt ignites small pools of liquid on their back. <br />
                                    <br /> "How's that? Is that a good heat?" Asks the demonstrator as they deftly handle a lit wand over the volunteer's back, creating small flashes of fire light. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yes." Replies the person with bursts of fire lighting across their skin. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It felt like the kink community in Halifax must be really tight-knit.<br />
                                    <br /> Inam's view it filled with a different scene, this one showing a person suspended from the ceiling by intricately tied ropes around their chest, arms, thighs, and ankles. Their long hair flutters as their body sways in the air. They are nude aside from their underwear. Another person stands by, running their hand through the suspended person's hair and smiling affectionately at them. The standing person wears a bra and collar, with a star under each eye and their hair pulled into a high ponytail. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And I was really moved by seeing the amount of trust they put in each other. <br />
                                    <br /> The scene concludes with the formerly suspended person now resting delicately on the ground with their head resting in the lap of the other person. The resting person looks vulnerable but safe, while the sitting person strokes their hair and beams at the applauding audience. <br />
                                    <br /> "Th-they must care about each other soooo much!!!" Inam thinks to herself as her eyes overflow with tears. "This is so beautiful!!!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Four<br /> Narration: I was really surprised by all the cool and interesting toys they had on display. <br />
                                    <br /> A table displays a paddle with a thickly furry side, an oversized "novelty" hammer, and "a sword???"<br />
                                    <br /> "What would you use that for?!" Inam thinks to herself. <br />
                                    <br /> At another demonstration, a person kneels over some furniture in a tiny dress, exposing their streaked bottom. Another person stands at their side in a leather harness top exposing their chest and long tight black pants. The standing person holds a long sword in their hands, clearly in the middle of spanking the bent over person with the flat length of the blade. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I never thought I'd see people spanking each other with medieval weapons. I didn't know kink could be this fun and light-hearted. I loved it." <br />
                                    <br /> Quietly, Inam pushes open a back door. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: When the dungeon got too crowded for me, I decided to head out to the vendors hall. <br />
                                    <br /> Poor Inam is blasted with garishly loud music as she enters a hall with rows of tables lined up and people inspecting their wares on them.  <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The stage was SO blaringly loud, and I got so nervous I ended up making several loops of the hall before I finally approached a seller.<br />
                                    <br /> From Inam's point of view, we see a cheerful vendor standing behind their table and holding out a sex toy.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And they were so, so friendly and helpful, I instantly felt better the moment we talked. <br />
                                    <br /> "We're a local Canadian toy company!" Chirps the vendor. <br />
                                    <br /> At another booth, a vendor stands as they show off a flogger that they dangle against their free hand. "Suede is a really soft material..." They explain. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It was so nice to hear them talk so passionately about their work.<br />
                                    <br /> From a different table, Inam reaches out to accept their bagged up purchase from a very tired (but still friendly) vendor. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I really felt for them having to work adjacent to a raging dance party thought. <br />
                                    <br /> "I WISH I WAS IN BED!" The vendor shouts over the music wearily as they wave goodbye to Inam. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Five<br /> "I think it's time to call it a night..." Inam thinks to herself as she loads her purchases into her backpack. <br />
                                    <br /> With regret in her eyes and odd diagrams with question marks floating by her head, she thinks, "I'm sorry, VacCube...  you will remain a mystery to me for now..."<br />
                                    <br /> Triumphantly, she marches back out into the nighttime cold, leaving little puffs of breath floating up into the sky. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I feel like I learned more in a single night at the Sex Show than I ever did from books and photos. All the silliness, tenderness and openness on display throughout the night gave me such a buzz (and also made me very hungry). <br />
                                    <br /> From the point of view of a street vendor, they hand down a take-out container of poutine to Inam, who stands on the sidewalk looking up expectantly at the warm meal. <br />
                                    <br /> Back at eye level, Inam looks at the reader, smiling just a bit mischievously as they take a big bite out of their meal and hold a big old dildo in the other hand. In the background, a handful of jacketed Sex Show patrons make their way home, their fishnets and boots revealing where they have just been. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I would 100% go again, and I'm already looking forward to next year.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Daverage draws with a soft, cartoony style and candy colors. <br />
                                    <br /> Abby is an anthropomorphic rabbit with a short build, long droopy ears, and dark curly har. Their chest is small and they have thick legs. The comic opens with a high up shot, looking down at an angle on Abby mid-rummage in their refrigerator with an egg carton in their hand before looking over at their cellphone vibrating on their kitchen counter. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hello?" They ask into their phone with their other hand still holding the egg carton. <br />
                                    <br /> "ABBY!!!" A voice exclaims through the phone so loudly that it sends Abby's ears flying in the opposite direction. <br />
                                    <br /> "Bently!" Replies Abby with a smile as they balance the phone between their ear and shoulder to free up both their hands to crack an egg into a frying pan. "Finally at your hotel room?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yup!" Bently's voice says through the phone. "and I'm totally beat..." <br />
                                    <br /> The camera pops over into Bently's hotel room, where he is flopped onto his bed on his back while talking into the phone. He is a taller, stocky anthropomorphic wombat with furry tufts across his thick body. He has a strong build without being muscle-y. <br />
                                    <br /> "Aw, poor baby..." Abby's voice sounds through his phone. "your tour is going alright though, yeah?" <br />
                                    <br /> "It's going great!" He replies. "Although I am looking forward to being back home." Looking a little shy, he scratches his temple with one finger as he continues, "It's been kinda rough without uhh... well, you know."<br />
                                    <br /> Back in Abby's kitchen, she cocks an eyebrow at their phone with a "Hm?" and rests the back of their hand (which is holding a spatula) against their hip. "Oh!" She exclaims in realization, raising her spatula into the air. "Ohhh~" She coos flirtatiously into the phone and motioning with the spatula coyly. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Two<br /> Abby's voice narrates over a close-up of the cooking egg in the pan, saying, "You must be pent up without me there to... Help~" The egg sizzles loudly as Abby slices the yolk open with the spatula and the goo runs into the pan. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> The camera angles up from the floor, giving us a full view of their pants-clad butt with a big poofy gray bunny tail. <br />
                                    <br /> "Bet you can't wait to get your hands on my ass, huh?" They ask. <br />
                                    <br /> "I really can't..." Bently's voice replies through the phone. <br />
                                    <br /> Looking sultry, Abby asks the phone, "Is that so?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Y-yeah..." Stutters Bently's voice. <br />
                                    <br /> In Bently's room, the camera looks at him from overhead on the bed. The phone rests next to his ear and his arms reach downwards, past the panel border as he closes his eyes with a big, pleased grin. <br />
                                    <br /> "HEHE" The phone says into his ear. "havin' fun there, big guy?" <br />
                                    <br /> "UHH!!" Bently exclaims, his eyes shooting open and then looking down guiltily in the direction of his arms. From his point of view we now see that he has unthinkingly been rubbing his ginormous boner through his pants. <br />
                                    <br /> With the camera back up to his face, he sheepishly answers "Mmmaybe?" with a blush to his phone. <br />
                                    <br /> "Haha, thought so!" Abby's voice laughs. "You may continue..." <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Three<br /> In Abby's kitchen, they balance the phone against their shoulder as they prepare to spread a sauce onto a split open sandwich roll. "First get comfy for me!" They order with a smile. "Get to strippin'!"<br />
                                    <br /> With no transition, Bently lays fully nude flat on his back on his hotel room bed. <br />
                                    <br /> "And now you may continue..." Abby's voice commands through the phone that lays on the bed next to him. No sooner has be begun to stroke himself than Abby's voice interjects with a, "WOAH WOAH! Not so fast! Slow down and enjoy yourself." As his hand delicately runs up and down his cock, Abby's voice commands, "Niiiice and slooooow." <br />
                                    <br /> In Abby's house, they walk from the kitchen to the living room with the phone balanced against their shoulder with one habd carrying a full mug and the other a plate with a thick sandwich. <br />
                                    <br /> "Now do that thing with your foreskin." They order deviously. <br />
                                    <br /> From Bently's point of view, we see his finger trace around the head of his cock, the tip of it wedged between his foreskin and round glans. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh gosh..." He sighs.<br />
                                    <br /> Sitting down on their couch with the phone still cradled to their ear, Abby says, "Now give the rest of ya the attention it deserves. Get handsy!"<br />
                                    <br /> Bently moans as he complies, using one hand to squeeze under his pectoral and the other firmly envelops his balls. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Four<br /> Panting, Bently brings the phone up to his ear to ask, "Now... now what?" His cock dribbles out pre-cum onto his hand that is firmly wrapped around his shaft. <br />
                                    <br /> "Now, uhh, show me that oe position you love so much!" Says Abby's voice. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ooo yeah!!" Bently chirps, sitting up straight. "Y-yes right away!"<br />
                                    <br /> Abby's phone dings from its perch on the couch's arm as they take a sip from their mug. <br />
                                    <br /> Picking up the phone, Abby exclaims "Holy shit, YES!!" upon seeing the photo of Bently from behind. His ass is propped up high in the air from his position on his knees with his hand pushing his cock between his legs towards the camera. His big heavy balls rest on his fist as he cheekily looks behind him towards the camera. <br />
                                    <br /> The angle moves to face him so we can see his big silly smile as he kneels with his ass in the air and his chest down on the bed, one arm disappearing down between his legs. <br />
                                    <br /> "Can I... go for it now?" He asks the phone that lays flat next to his head. <br />
                                    <br /> "On my signal" Responds Abby's voice. <br />
                                    <br /> Eyes spiraling, the background dissolves into dots as Bently exclaims, "I'm at my limit here, please, Abby."<br />
                                    <br /> Peacefully leaning back into their couch, Abby ever-so-calmly grins as they say, "Aaaaaaaaaaand"<br />
                                    <br /> With an ominous close-up on their mouth, Abby concludes, "Cum for me."<br />
                                    <br /> "Hnnng!!" Bently groans as he releases his pent-up orgasm. From behind again, his cock shoots towards us, breaking through the panel border. His haunches tremble and his butt hole clenches as he grimaces in pleasure. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Five<br /> Abby stands up from the couch, holding the phone to one ear while with the other they carry their empty plate with the mug balanced on it. "Feeling better, stud?" They ask with feigned casualness. <br />
                                    <br /> "You have no idea." Replies Bently as he props himself back up from his flopped position on the bed. Now sitting fully upright, he can see the mess he's left on himself and says, "But I could really use a shower."<br />
                                    <br /> "Hop to it, smelly!" Abby's voice teases through the phone. <br />
                                    <br /> Connected through the phones over the distance, they chatter back and forth. <br />
                                    <br /> "I love youuuu." Bently coos as he makes his way to his hotel bathroom. <br />
                                    <br /> Putting their dish in the soapy sink, Abby coos back, "I  love you mooooore."<br />
                                    <br /> "Not as much as me." He says. <br />
                                    <br /> "In your dreams, ya lug."<br />
                                    <br /> "Rest easy, bunny bun."<br />
                                    <br /> "Talk to you in the morning."<br />
                                    <br /> The phone call over, Abby gets to work washing their dishes as they day dream about their partner talking on his phone to them. The daydreams begin growing and filling with more and more intense images of all the sexy shenanigans that Bently just did in that hotel room so far away until finally Abby throws their hands to their head as they exclaim, "GAAAAAAHH!!!" in frustration. <br />
                                    <br /> In his hotel bathroom, we see the steam rising from behind Bently's shower curtain. His phone sits dormant on the edge of the counter until suddenly it illuminates with a "VRRR" alert. With a look of feigned casualness and teasing expectation, he pulls aside the shower curtain to see his vibrating phone. <br />

                                <br /> Massive thank-you to my wonderful friend Pup Clay who graciously shared his story with me! This comic wouldn’t have been possible without ‘cha! I wanted to focus on his emotional journey here, but the reality of wearing a cock cage is a whole ‘nother story for another time! If you’re finding yourself curious about the kink, please do your research and practice with caution and safety &lt;3!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> Two anthropomorphic men sit amorously on a cute bed in an adorably cozy room. Artistic public transit maps are hung on the walls, along with a hot dog calendar, other miscellaneous postcard-sized images, and cute storefront signs. One trinket shelf holds miniatures trains, both modern and original, while the other houses a dollhouse-sized asian building. A beanbag chair sits at the end of the bed, next to a backpack. The men are in the early stages of kissing and beginning to stroke each other's arms and thighs. Hien is a brown bear with glasses, top knot, and a beard, while Clay is a yellow labrador with blue curly hair.<br />
                                    <br /> Pulling back, Clay asks seductively, "Hey~ You wanna see something fun?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Ooh... Wouldn't I?" Hien replies, as his friend guides his hand up his thigh to the bulge between his legs. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!" Hien exclaims in surprise and delight. <br />
                                    <br /> With pride, Clay announces "Cock cage!", cheekily sticking out a little tongue at Hien. "I've been wearing it for a while, but I don't think I've shown you yet!" He announces while pulling his pants down to reveal a tight little black cock cage secured on his dingus, sitting atop his balls like a crown. A think black belt connects to the base of the device. <br />
                                    <br /> "No, you haven't!" Agrees Hien, who magically transforms into his scientist outfit of oversize glasses, research clipboard and pen, and donning an open white lab coat over his bare chest and boxers. "What is it like? How did you find one you liked? Tell me everything!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Hah! Never a bad time for comic research, huh?" Clay laughs, sticking his tongue out in faux annoyance. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Thoughtfully stroking his chin, Clay explains, "Well, I've always been into chastity, but it took me years to find a cage that fits right." <br />
                                    <br /> The mini-heads of Clay and Hien float between larger-than-life illustrations of two different cock cage models. The silver one features thing bars that resembles a birdcage while the gold one covers the entire surface of the penis with heart-shaped air holes punched in along the shaft and a hole at the top for fluids to exit the penis head. Annotation reads "Sits weird!" and "D Ring shape painful!" next to the silver one, and "tight tit! Ring too flat!" next to the gold one. <br />
                                    <br /> Little Clay looks morose as he narrates, "Previous cages I got were too rigid, and my balls were either gripped too vigorously, or they would retract right out of the included rings..."<br />
                                    <br /> Little Hien asks, "Cages weren't cheap either, were they? It must have been difficult to shop around for the correct size." <br />
                                    <br /> In one tall vertical panel, Clay lands with his back to us, naked, on his hands and knees in an icy spotlight against a dark blue void. Cock cages sit abandoned beside him. "Yeah..." He explains, clearly devastated. "...each cage that didn't fit would fuel my bad body image issues... it felt like my own body was preventing me from getting into what I liked!" <br />
                                    <br /> Triumphantly, the next panel is a sunny, warp-drive close-up to his cock in the small black cage from the previous page. <br />
                                    <br /> "It wasn't until a friend let me play around with his cage collection that I found the perfect fit!" He explains. "And guess what? The final piece of the puzzle is a waist strap that keeps everything in place!" A caption explains that the cage is "Lightweight! 3D-printed!" and has a "Curved ring!" to go around the base of the cock and balls. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Twirling his pen for emphasis, Hien enthuses, "It was never your body's fault! Just wasn't the right toy!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Exactly!" Agrees Clay, sticking his tongue out in defiant pride. "Now I feel super sexy and heaps more confident!" Then, with a knowing, conspiratorial wink, he adds, "Like, popular gay culture can be so insensitive about dick sizes, but with cages..."<br />
                                    <br /> "The allure is in the access or lack thereof, right?" Finishes Hien. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yep!" Clay chirps. "A fruit forbidden only sweetens."<br />
                                    <br /> The rest of the page transitions into a dark club party scene under blue lights. The first panel crops in relatively closely, showing us only the torsos and upper thighs of the two fetish outfit clad people. The one in a black leather jacket (with no shirt), pants, and wrist cuff assertively cups the rubber-clad ballsack pocket of the other person, who is wearing a black and blue tight rubber short-sleeved and short-pantsed suit. Little hearts flutter from the cupped rubber dick and ball pouch. <br />
                                    <br /> The narration reads, "I still get so in my head about how my body responds to touch... like whether I'm hard enough... The cage removes that performance anxiety, and keeps me grounded in giving pleasure instead of receiving." <br />
                                    <br /> Still in the same blue-lighted party space, the reader now has the point of view of somebody sitting back with their legs extended out before them so that a rubber-clad Clay can fondle and lick them while a Magic Wand buzzes away on his cock cage and balls that are exposed in the open area between his rubber pants legs.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: That way, sex often skews toward the kinky side, which I absolutely love!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> The page transitions to a warm, pink light. <br />
                                    <br /> "That's amazing." Hien says, tapping the butt of his pen against his cheek. "I didn't realize how helpful cock cages could be. In some ways, I can relate to that with my Shibari practice." <br />
                                    <br /> A detailed, beautiful illustration fills the page with close-up of a bare-chested figure who is unwinding with one hand a bound cord of magenta rope that he holds in the other. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Working with my ropes shifts the focus from my physical, bodily anxieties to my skills and my presence. In those moments, I know exactly who I am, where my place is and what my purpose is in the world. <br />
                                    <br /> A big masculine bunny person looks peaceful and content as they are tied up in the magenta rope by a calmly smiling Hien, who stands behind him. The two lean against each other, nuzzling. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The ropes become an extension of my body that I use to conduct fantasies and heighten feelings in a way that no one else can. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien's hands gently push the bunny down by the shoulders, exposing the fancy knot work across his back. <br />
                                    <br /> A mini head of Clay appears, contrasting starkly against the pink lighting of the scene. He comments, " 'Heighten feelings' is exactly right." <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The lighting goes back to normal in the real world as we rejoin Hien and Clay in the bedroom. <br />
                                    <br /> "I struggle so much with my low libido..." Clay says, clasping his hands over his cock cage. "Life stress, work stress, worries that just wouldn't leave even when I escaped interstate to sexy queer events..." Hi face looks up hopefully as he continues, "Finding the right cage has enabled me to practice chastity comfortably. It's heightened my sex drive and sensitivity to new levels that just feel... right." <br />
                                    <br /> "Here I was wondering why you've suddenly been so horny lately!" Laughs Hien, pulling Clay in to smoosh their checks together affectionately. "Who knew a simple cage could make you squirm with even the slightest touch!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Hehe! It's fun, isn't it?" Agrees Clay. <br />
                                    <br /> "Personally," Hien says, tapping his finger against the shining cage. "I don't know if cock cages are for me. But I do know I've gained a new appreciation for them, thanks to you!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Bork!" Barks Clay, with little hearts radiating from his words. "It's my pleasure! Literally!" <br />

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Christine is ready to become a parent, but is it ever so simple? Todays comic is a slice of autobio, a snippet in-between; a queer person exploring what pregnancy means to themselves and the world around them. Hope you love it as much as we do! Thank you so much Christine for the lovely piece. [&amp;#8230;]</summary>

                        <p>Thank you so much Christine for the lovely piece. Christine was a here a few years ago talking about what <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/seeing-my-body-as-nonbinary-christine-suggs/">being nonbinary meant to them!</a> It’s a lovely little comic that goes great with this one today! Once your done reading, make sure to let Christine know they’re awesome-sauce!</p>

With things being so turbulant we’ve still not made plans for a Pledge Drive; just living week to week, and that feels like a victory.</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Christine Suggs draws in a soft, cartoony style with a textured line and mostly flat, bright colors. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Visiting my parents' house. <br />
                                    <br /> "You abut ready to head out?" Calls a voice through the bathroom door. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah, one sec-" Christine replies as they tousle their shock of spiky black hair on the top of their head, admiring their reflection in the bathroom mirror. They are a nonbinary plus size Mexican American person in a yellow collared button-down shirt and jeans.<br />
                                    <br /> A gross red "GOOSH" sound effect fills the air, causing Christine to flinch and blush. <br />
                                    <br /> Christine unbuckles their pants, shimmying them downwards to the tile floor. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Thanks to my birth control, it's been nearly five years since my last period. <br />
                                    <br /> The panel crops in on their bare lower legs that have a smattering of hair and little tattoos on them, their jeans pooling around their feet. <br />
                                    <br /> "OH." Christine exclaims. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Recently my husband and I made the decision to start trying for kids. And here I was, in my parents' house feeling like a pre-teen. <br />
                                    <br /> Tentatively, Christine pokes their head out from the bathroom door, calling, "Uh, Mom? Could you come here a minute?"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Of course, things were a little different this time around.<br />
                                    <br /> "Do you think a panty liner will work?" Christine's mom asks while offering one in her hand. She is a Mexican woman with chin length black hair. The caption "Post Menopause" helpfully points at her with a little arrow. <br />
                                    <br /> Laughingly, Christine reaches out to accept the sanitary pad, saying, "It'll have to!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Caption: It felt right that it happened now, after spending a weekend with my family. <br />
                                    <br /> Christine's rolling luggage and backpack sit to the side as they hug their mother, saying "Bye, Mom!" <br />
                                    <br /> To which their Mom replies, "Love you."<br />
                                    <br /> "Drive safe." Their father, a plus size white man with a white flat top, tells Christine's brother with a friendly clap on the shoulder. <br />
                                    <br /> "Will do." Grady, their brother responds, one hand on his backpack shoulder strap. He is a plus size Mexican American person with thick black hair and glasses.<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: My brother, as always, was working hard to get my parents to use the right pronouns for me. <br />
                                    <br /> Behind the driver's wheel in the car, Grady asks, "Ready?" <br />
                                    <br /> "YES." They reply as they pull the seat belt across their chest. Their words are spoken with confidence but their face looks panicked, with a little sweat drop rolling down their temple. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Like most of my trips to my small and conservative hometown, I simmered in anxiety. This time I brought a few new ones. <br />
                                    <br /> Christine looks contemplatively out the car window as the sky and hillside roll by. The scene outside the window fills up with their internal worries, reading, "What will your baby even call you? What if they never stop misgendering you?? How will your body change?"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Coming home is my favorite feeling. It's the place I feel most powerful and at ease. <br />
                                    <br /> Christine stands on the walkway leading to their home, waving to their brother's car as he drives away. Their brick house has a brown picket fence, green lawn, and both a cactus and a shrubby bush just to the side of the entrance steps. A big Progress Pride flag hangs proudly over the front door, showing both the traditional rainbow stripes with the newer addition of the back, brown, blue, pink, and white chevrons with a purple O on a yellow triangle. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: I worked so hard to buy this house, a lot of it with the money I got from my book deal. <br />
                                    <br /> As Christine pulls their roll-y bag towards the house, they smile up at the flag and then let themself in through the front door. <br />
                                    <br /> "ARF!! ARF!!!" A medium-sized point-eared dog barks enthusiastically as it jumps up to greet Christine. <br />
                                    <br /> "Didja miss me, buddy?" They ask their dog, giving it a friendly scratch on the back of its neck. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Home is where I feel ready to be a parent. <br />
                                    <br /> "mrrrrowww!" Their cat ginger cat howls, not even letting Christine take off their backpack yet. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Caption: Over the coming months I'd deal with heavy bleeding, iron deficiencies, rampant hormones, and all the buzzing excitement that comes with trying to have a child. <br />
                                    <br /> In the bathroom, Christine (who finally got to take off their backpack) pulls out a box of pads from under the sink. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: And then there's pregnancy: That scry and mysterious experience that will forever change the body I've worked so hard to love. <br />
                                    <br /> With calm serenity, Christine pulls their button-up yellow shirt over their head, exposing their gray sports bra, hairy armpits, and belly with subtle pink stripes curving down the sides. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: There's so many more conversations I need to have with doctors and family about my body, my gender, and its boundaries. <br />
                                    <br /> Now changed into soft jammies, Christine turns on their stove to heat their kettle. They wear a fluffy pink cardigan with red hearts, a gray crop top, and blue stripped sweatpants. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hey, I  missed you! Calls their partner's voice from off panel. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: But for now I am home, And somehow, I am ready to welcome a child into our little world. <br />
                                    <br /> Their partner, Kyle, leans down to kiss the top of Christine's head with a little "smeck!" and a side hug. He is a tall plus size white man with medium brown hair. <br />
                                    <br /> "I missed you too." They reply with a smile as they bring their tea mug to their lips. <br />
                                    <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Lube 101 by Ripley LaCross, published February 18, 2025 on OhJoySexToy.com<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley LaCross illustrates this comic with a bouncy, cartoony style and a limited color palette of gray-blues, black, white, pink, and maroon. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hey there, perverts! I'm Murray!" Greets a Muppet-esque hand puppet who is sitting atop a brick wall. Only a sliver of the arm of the puppeteer is visible behind them. They are a pale pink with big ping pong ball-sized eyes, three black hairs erupting off the top of their football-shaped head, and sporting a short-sleeved maroon shirt with a black collar, which they wear Donald Duck style (no pants) with their thin little legs dangling over the side of the wall. <br />
                                    <br /> "and I'm Kurt!" Adds a white puppet with a mop of pink hair and a big egg-shaped pink nose. They are holding hands with Murray on the wall, and likewise have just a hint showing of the arm of their puppeteer. They wear a long sleeve pink shirt with a V-neck and, unlike Murray, wear black pants with maroon shoes. They continue, "Today we'd like to gush about one of our favorite subjects!"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Welcome to...<br />
                                    <br /> Gloopy, drippy letters spell out, "LUBE 101"<br />
                                    <br /> "But first!" Murray announces, now moving through the air with the forearm of their puppeteer discreetly in view. "What even is lube?"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: LUBRICANT (lube): a substance that helps to reduce friction between surfaes in mutual contact. <br />
                                    <br /> Tossing a fried egg in a frying pan, Kurt adds, "Lube is used for all sorts of stuff! Like keeping your doors squeak-free! Or those expensive eggs from sticking to the pan!" The arm of Kurt's puppeteer is just barely visible before it disappears off to the side of the page. <br />
                                    <br /> "But our favorite kind of lube is SEXUAL LUBRICANT!" Says Murray as they co-lift a giant bottle of squirting lube overhead with Kurt. "Not only does it feel great, but lube also reduces the chances of breaking condoms!" <br />
                                    <br /> "And lowers the risk of tears and fissures, and therefore STIs! It just makes everything better!" Finishes Kurt.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Two<br /> Playfully, Murray hauls a brimming pail labeled "LUBE!" from outside the boundaries of the panel, preparing to chuck it at their companion. "All right Kurt, open wide! Lube incoming!"<br />
                                    <br /> "But Murray!" Kurt frets. "They don't even know about all the different kinds of lubes out there!"<br />
                                    <br /> In silhouette, we see Murray toss the bucket aside as they exclaim, "WHAT?! Let's fix that!"<br />
                                    <br /> The page fills with light blue panels, serving as informational cards. <br />
                                    <br /> --<br /> Caption: Water-Based<br /> -Most popular and easiest to find.<br /> -Cleans up fast!<br /> -Available in thick and thin consistencies.<br /> -Simple ingredients make it gentle on your skin, <br />
                                    <br /> A tube squeezes out lube onto Murray's speech balloon, which reads, "If it gets tacky, a spritz of water will slick it up again!" To demonstrate, they use a petit mister bottle to spray a light spritz of water onto the lube dripping off their balloon and pooling on the ground. <br />
                                    <br /> --<br /> Caption: Silicone<br /> -Water-resistant &amp; long-lasting!<br /> -Ideal for anal.<br /> -Difficult to clean up and stains fabric.<br /> -Can sometimes melt cheap silicone toys, do a spot test!<br />
                                    <br /> Kurt depresses the head nozzle on a partially filled bottle, dispensing lube in a stream onto their word balloon, which reads, "We like putting pump tops on our lube! They come free with most hand sanitizers!" <br />
                                    <br /> --<br /> Caption: Hybrid/Silk<br /> -Water-based with traces of silicone. <br /> -Longer lasting than water.<br /> -Mid-tier cleanup, but can still stain fabrics.<br /> -Some brands are safe for silicone toys, check the manufacturer!<br />
                                    <br /> An upside down bottle dispenses a stream of lube that floods across the bottom of the page, overlapping into the next panel. <br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Look for as few ingredients as possible. Slip away from these!<br />
                                    <br /> Within lube-y dollops are the words, "Fragrances, Parabens, 'Botanicals', Glycerine, Propylene Glycol, 'Essential Oils'".<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Some makers hide, rename, or use vague terms for ingredients. When in doubt, look it up!<br /> --<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Three<br /> Murray erupts from behind a blue panel, like a whale breaching the ocean surface. Strings of lube fly off their outstretched arms as they announce, "Some lubes have a little more character! Use these ones with caution!<br />
                                    <br /> Each following section is contained in its own light blue informational card. <br />
                                    <br /> --<br /> Title: Oils<br /> -Made from coconut, sunflower, cocoa, avocado, and more.<br /> -For use with polyurethane, nitrile, and lambskin condoms only. <br /> -Ultra long-lasting. <br /> -Water resistant!<br />
                                    <br /> Murray reclines, propped up on one arm, in the center of this info card, showing off the gaping entrance between their legs where the puppeteer's hand would go if it were there right now. With their free hand, they confidently adjust their heart-shaped sunglasses that have appeared out of nowhere while flirtatiously adding, "Drill, baby, drill!"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Oils are great for anal and some can double as massage oils. But be wary if you have nut allergies! They can also upset the vagina's natural pH levels, and possibly degrade silicone and plastic toys. Use with care!<br />
                                    <br /> --<br /> Title: Flavored<br /> -For oral stimulation only. <br /> -Contain sugars and artificial flavors. <br />
                                    <br /> Icons of cherries, a watermelon slice, a strawberry, a peach, and a circular lollipop with swirl in the center are haloed with lube, some of which connects to each other with a lube-y strand. Kurt looks disappointedly at a blue lube-y phallus in their hands, with a telltale drop of lube trailing from their mouth. "This doesn't taste at all like banana..." They say dejectedly. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Keep these above the belt, the extra ingredients are a recipe for vaginal irritation or even infection!<br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Moisturizing Lotions<br /> Caption: Perfect for handies and massages!<br /> A jaunty bottle of ube with a push-top slides along a lube trail that stretches across the info card.<br />
                                    <br /> -Contain oils and alcohols.<br /> -For external, dermal (that's your skin) use only. <br />
                                    <br /> "If your dongle is going near anyone's dingle, just use actual lube." A chibi-fied head of Murray adds in the corner. <br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> Title: "Cum" Lubes<br /> Caption: Got a breeding kink? Combine cum lubes with an ejaculating dildo and go wild! But be wary of extra ingredients!<br />
                                    <br /> Kurt and Murray sit on a ledge in the middle of the info card, cheering as a blue phallus erupts with a spout of fluid that is furnished from the cum-container that connects to it with a tube that Murray holds. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: <br /> -Thick and goopy.<br /> -Resembles semen for an immersive experience. <br /> -Contain cornstarch and/or titanium dioxide. <br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> Title: CBD./THC Infused<br /> Caption: Cannabis lubes come with a lot of health claims but we found few lube-specific studies to back them up. Use these at your own risk! <br />
                                    <br /> Little blue icons of marijuana leaves dot the info card. In the center of the page, the puppeteers arm holds Murray aloft as they mime pulling their "pants" pockets inside out (Remember, Murray does not actually have any pants on) and moths and dollar signs fly out as they explain, "They're also REALLY expensive! Puppets are made of felt, not money!"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption:<br /> -Can be water or oil-based.<br /> -Unregulated. <br /> --<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page Four<br /> Title: Warming/Cooling<br /> -Available in water, silicone, and hybrid blends.<br /> -Contain capsaicin, L-Arginine, peppermint, and.or menthol for an "extra spicy" experience. <br />
                                    <br /> Clad in a firefighter's helmet, Kurt uses a fire extinguisher to blast a raging fire that's erupted in the center of the info card as they explain, "If by 'extra spicy' you mean 'Literally feels like you have an infection.'" <br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Desensitizing<br /> -Contain local anesthetics like benzocaine &amp; lidocaine to reduce sensation.<br /> -Similar sprays exist for deep throating. <br />
                                    <br /> Murray sits in a puddle of lube, pointing in horror at their little legs stretched out before them, yelling, "I can't feel my legs!"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Often meant to help with Premature Ejaculation, these are usually marketed to make anal "easier." But they number your body's ability to say "STOP!" Use with extreme caution.<br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> The info card background explodes into a watery slosh, with the title reading "So, how do you even use this stuff?"<br />
                                    <br /> A tiny Murray hauls out their Pail O'Lube, announcing, "Grab your lube of choice, we've got a lot to cover!" Kurt leads the way with an enormous bottle of lube over their head, the both of these mini puppets racing towards a set of giant, more realistically drawn human bottom ends that are being serviced by lubed up hands. One bottom is shown bent over from behind, their penis mid-thrust into another body while a lube-y hand presses one finger into their exposed butt hole. The other bottom shows someone reclining on their back and using their own hand to stroke and slide along their lube-y vulva. <br />
                                    <br /> In a caption box made of lube, the text reads: If everything's staying on the outside, a few drops will go a long way! But for penetration, cover the entire surface area of your tool of choice. Don't forget to lube up in and around the entrance of wherever that tool is going!<br />
                                    <br /> Two sets of floating hands demonstrate lubing up toys. One hand pumps lube from a bottle onto a phallus, which the other hand spreads across it by rubbing it top to bottom. The other hand set shows a hand turning the base of a butt plug so that the bulbous head rotates through the puddle of lube in the other hand. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: You can use as much as you like, but too much can actually reduce sensation. So start light and work your way up from there. Pro tip! Silicone toys require more lube, glass and metal need less. <br />
                                    <br /> --<br /> Back in the light blue info card, Murray massages the back and butt of the still fully-clothed Kurt (Who still has a whole lubed up hand and arm inserted up through their bottom area. Somehow, this is actually kind of discreet?) <br />
                                    <br /> "How ya doing, darling?" Murray asks. <br /> "Slick as a whistle!" Cheerfully replies Kurt. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Pay attention to how it feels and sounds to figure out your sweet spot. Communicate with your partner and don't be shy about reapplying! Folks with vaginas, as always, urinate immediately after sex. More fluids = the farther bacteria spreads. Folks who are puppets, dry-clean only. <br /> --<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> Kurt's puppeteer withdraws their hand from their opening, pulling out a soggy letter envelope. <br />
                                    <br /> "Look, Kurt! We've got fanmail!" Exclaims Murray. <br />
                                    <br /> Murray and Kurt's faces drop as the text of the letter fills the panel, fading out as it scrolls down. Some of the text reads, "Dear Kurt and Murray: What's the deal with all this lube chatter? Don't you guys know we make our own natural lube?? You're OBVIOUSLY doing it WRONG. All you gotta do is get them all nice and warmed up and stick your fingers... swirl... until they... wet..."<br />
                                    <br /> "I'll take it from here, fellas." Announces a voice from off panel, only their fingerless-gloved hand showing as it takes the soggy letter from the puppets. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh, hi Ripley!" Murray chirps. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley, the more realistically drawn human, stands in full glory behind the waist-high brick wall from the opening page. They have a messy undercut, glasses, and a smattering of facial hair. Their sleeveless jacket is covered in pins and patches, their black t-shirt accentuated by a tight ball-linked necklace. Kurt and Murray sit on either side of them, with Ripley's hands supportively cupping them around their midsections. <br />
                                    <br /> Cocking an eyebrow, Ripley announces, "Alright you perverts, listen up. Someone's ability to get 'wet' is super personal and depends on a whole lot of factors."<br />
                                    <br /> "Stuff like hydration, meds, stress, age, diet, and more!" Shrugs Murray. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley continues, "So associating it with arousal or performance just sets you up for a bummer time."<br />
                                    <br /> "And why do that when lube is super fun!" Cheers Kurt. <br />
                                    <br /> The three take a running slide across a streak of lube across the width of the page, like a Slip'n'Slide from the 90s.<br />
                                    <br /> In a surfer stance, Ripley concludes, "We gotta slide past all these hang-ups! Grab a bottle and get slippery, y'all!" while Kurt and Murray zip ahead on their butt and tummy, shrieking in delight. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Something Sweeter by Pigeon, published February 11, 2025 on ohjoysextoy.com/something-sweeter-pigeon<br />
                                    <br /> With a color palette of muted maroons, beiges, pinks, browns, and teal, Pigeon illustrates this Rocco comic with delicate, lacy details. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1: <br /> A four-poster bed with heavy burgundy curtains sits in an opulent room with expensive-looking furniture that are reminiscent of the Marie Antoinette days. Lady sleepily opens her eyes in her big soft bed. <br />
                                    <br /> She has flowing, long and dark hair, styled into an extravagant rococo-style hairdo.<br /> Big eyes with long eyelashes and a dreamy gaze. Soft lips with a hint of smile and a few beauty spots on her face. The noticeable features are also her well-pronounced cheekbones and nose. Tall and slender, and her skin is dark and smooth.<br />
                                    <br /> She wears white stockings tied with blue ribbons and shiny blue shoes adorned with bows. On her neck we can see a sheer lace choker decorated with a string of pearls. Similar irregular pearls are visible in her earrings and decorating her hair. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> "Cake, mylady?" Asks her maid as she offers her an ornate tray with four suggestive teal cakes displayed on it. Each palm-size cake is a teal half-sphere with light pink icing decorating the base and a twirled dollop of dark pink icing on top, resembling four colorful breasts presented on a tray beneath the apron-clad ample bosom of the maid.  <br />
                                    <br /> The perspective moves to the opposite side of the room, where we see the Lady regarding the maid hungrily from her bed and, in the foreground, we now see that the curvy maid is ONLY wearing her apron, leaving her backside entirely exposed to us. The big loose bow made by the apron strings brushes against her full curvy figure. <br />
                                    <br /> She is a mix of auburn and brown, braided and neatly pinned up, crowned with a white maid band on the top of her head. A multitude of freckles cover her face and arms, complementing her warm complexion. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Revealing her face for the first time, we now see that the maid has a playful expression on her face, with her thick eyebrows, round nose and well pronounced lips. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hmm. I suppose that'll do." The Lady coos back, Her white pear tear-drop shaped earrings and lace collar contrast elegantly against her dark skin. <br />
                                    <br /> "Well then..." The maid says as she climbs onto the plush bed with her tray of treats balanced in one hand as the other uses her Lady's thigh to balance herself. <br />
                                    <br /> Without moving, the Lady remains nestled among her frilly, silky pillows as the maid hands a single cake to her. The way that the maid wrests her forearm along the center of the Lady's torso and the way she's partially crouched over her legs shows us this is a practiced intimacy between the two. 	<br />
                                    <br /> "mmmm" The Lady purrs as she parts her lips for the treat that her maid feeds to her. <br />
                                    <br /> Looking directly into her eyes, the maid asks with a sultry expression, "Am I allowed one as well?" She rests her hand just below her Lady's breast. <br />
                                    <br /> "I... Yes." The Lady responds, with a round cake balanced on her chest, just above her own full round breasts. A triumvirate of nipples is created between the Lady's own deep mahogany ones and the cake's bright pink icing topping. "I'll allow it." She concludes. <br />
                                    <br /> Straddling her Lady, the maid brings her face just between her mistress's breasts and coos, "Beautiful..." while looking deeply into her eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> "aAH..." The Lady reacts as the maid uses the tip of her tongue to encircle her nipple. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> The maid raises her head up again to take a bite out of the teal cake that she now holds in her hand, while she still props the length of her body against the Lady's. The Lady, in turn, palms her maid's cheek with her hand while she chews, moaning, "Mmm..." <br />
                                    <br /> "I don't know, dear." The Lady says, lifting the maid's chin with her hand. "I think I need something... sweeter." To which the maid dives in for a full kiss, her tongue caressing the other's. <br />
                                    <br /> Pulling back just far enough to speak, the maid asks "How about this?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Ah... Yes. Much better." The Lady replies, nose-to-nose with her maid and looking hungrily into her eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> Bringing her lips close to her Lady's ear, the maid whispers, "You can have ME for dessert."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Confidently, the Lady replies, "With pleasure." <br />
                                    <br /> In one deft movement, the maid raises herself up to her knees which straddle the Lady on either side, while pulling back her apron's skirt to reveal her smooth pussy which hovers for a second just barely higher than her Lady's nose. <br />
                                    <br /> With both hands, the Lady grabs the space just between her maid's butt cheeks and thighs, pulling her lower body onto her hungry mouth. "Ooh!" the maid gasps as she grabs tightly onto the pillows that surround her Lady's head. <br />
                                    <br /> At first delicately, she licks between her lips with the tip of her tongue, eliciting gentle "aaahh!"s and "nnNNgH!"s until she dives in deeply, pulling her maid's bottom half hard onto her face. "MMMMH!" The maid groans, rocking her body against her mistress' mouth. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> A while later we find the two women splayed out on their backs across the bed cover. Their hair is disheveled, leaving elegantly curled locks splayed along the rumpled satin sheets. The tray of partially eaten cakes sits discarded but just within reach. In pure relaxation and contentment, they sigh. <br />
                                    <br /> Sitting up at the edge of the bed, the Lady announces, "Hm. I suppose it's time for us." Her maid follows suit. <br />
                                    <br /> Now clad in a loose dour dark dress with long sleeves and a white basic blunt frill around the edges, the lady pulls her hair up into a bun. <br />
                                    <br /> "Let me help." Her maid says, as she pulls her own matching dark dress up over her shoulders. <br />
                                    <br /> "There." Says the maid, closing the final button on the back of her "Lady's" working-class dress. "It's such a shame-"<br />
                                    <br /> "To go back to work?" The "Lady" asks her companion, the both of them now fully dressed in their modest maid's uniforms, complete with white aprons. Making the bed, she continues, "I know... But the lady is going away again next week..." <br />
                                    <br /> Over the tray of half-eaten cakes, we hear her say, "...Until next time, my love."<br /> Transcribed by Erika Moen on February 10, 2025 for https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/something-sweeter-pigeon<br />

                        </div>While we are <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/celebrate-10-years-of-magic/">sponsored by the amazing folks at Magic Wand</a>, and promised to make todays comic for them, it wasn’t made with any of their input, and we don’t dress up our reviews for anyone! Heck here’s another side of the coin: while Hien had a great time with his wand, I personally hatttttte the way a vibe feels on my donger, it’s just too intense (and quickly followed by that Hein-mentioned numbness). Great fun to use on somebody else, by for me? Noooo-thank you; it’s way too much sensation! Different strokes for different folks!<p />

                                <div id="transcript-content">In this lushly illustrated comic, artist Hien Pham switches between highly detailed, realistic drawings and simplified cartoons or chibis that emote exaggeratedly. The full spectrum of colors is used vividly throughout. Hien Pham is a bearded, bald, fat Asian man with spots and scars on his butt who is wearing glasses, pink shorts, and an open white lab jacket with no shirt underneath. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> "You know..." Hien says contemplatively, resting his chin in his hand. "...it's been over a decade of Oh Joy Sex Toy... but there's not one Magic Wand review for the penis! Do you know what that means?" <br />
                                    <br /> Caption spelled out in fun cursive with some hearts floating nearby: It's Time For Sexy Science! <br />
                                    <br /> Chibi Hien and a naked companion Masturbateer come jogging onto the page with an enormous Magic Wand Rechargeable massager held aloft. It has a big white spherical head that connects with a thinner short, blue neck to a long tapered handle with three blue buttons on it. <br />
                                    <br /> "Does the famed Erotic Invigorator work on my penile pleasure sponge?" Asks Hien with a pink heart and emotive marks emanating around his head. <br />
                                    <br /> "Let's find out together!" Responds the blonde companion who is similarly covered in a pattern of body hair across their chest and round tummy. <br />
                                    <br /> Chibi Hien hangs into the panel upside down as the normal-sized and realistically-drawn Masturbateer reclines on his back with his legs in the air, holding the wand's vibrating head against the area below his scrotum and above his anus. <br />
                                    <br /> "Out of the box, the Wand felt amazingly pleasant! Especially on the taint, where the vibrations spread out to all of the sensitive areas nearby!" <br />
                                    <br /> Now full-sized and realistically drawn as well, Hien reclines next to the startled Masturbateer, saying, "It felt so relaxing, in fact, that I wasn't really aroused at all... that is, until I discovered just the right spot!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Chibi Hien holds up a neon pink arrow that points to the lightly scarred line that runs up the entire length of an enormous anthropomorphized intact (uncircumcised) penis that towers over him. In loose cursive lettering, the title "The Frenulum" illuminates overhead. The penis's big googly eyes close in pride. <br />
                                    <br /> The anthropomorphized Magic Wand head vibrates with its lips puckered against the penis, whose eyes light up with hearts. The background fills with a radiating pink heart, emphasizing the kind of growing-radiating sensation that the vibrator provides. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Not all penises are as sensitive as mine, but when the Wand kissed my frenulum, I was taken by the feel-good sensations!<br />
                                    <br /> Chibi Hien throws an enormous teal blanket over the head of an enormous Magic Wand head, saying, "A tea towel helped diffuse the vibrations to a perfect rumble."<br />
                                    <br /> "A touch of water-based lube helped with the friction too!" Chimes in the chibi companion as he rubs a transparent liquid over the head of the anthropomorphic cock, which closes its eyes in contentment. <br />
                                    <br /> The covered wand presses against the penis again, which opens its eyes in pleasurable surprise. The background fills up with the same radiating heart design, but now it is orange and yellow. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: The Wand felt like a constant and persistent tickle to the tip of the penis and foreskin. Then, whenever I clenched, the arousing pleasures intensified in a big big way!<br />
                                    <br /> The exact same panel repeats, but now the covered wand and penis are in greater vibrating action, with the eyes of the penis squeezed shut in delight and the background replaced with an exploding orange star. <br />
                                    <br /> The realistically-drawn companion gasps as he ejaculates with the covered wand pressed against the underside of his dick. His free hand tweaks his nipple. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Eyes closed, I let my mind fantasize as I touched my chest. I didn't think I would come, but the waves of pleasure kept coming until I came!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> "But that's not all!" Chibi Hien exclaims as his pink rope lassos the chibi Masturbateer with a Shibari rope harness that ties him up from this thighs to his shoulders. "I found plenty of other ways to harness the vibrations!" The enormous, anthro Magic Wand sports its own shibari rope harness along its shaft, looking quite surprised. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: I improvised a simple hip tie, and felt the entire rope rumble through the happy knot under my balls!<br />
                                    <br /> The camera angle looks up from the ground between the realistically-drawn companion's legs to see the Wand head vibrating away at his roped-up taint area. <br />
                                    <br /> From overhead, the camera looks down at the belt of ropes around his waist, with a few lengths pinched between his butt cheeks. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: The vibrations felt best on the bit of rope taut in between the bum!<br />
                                    <br /> Back to their chibi forms, the tiny Masturbateer rolls in an enormous anthropomorphic transparent surprised-looking masturbation sleeve with a teal coil around it. Hien exuberantly hauls in an enormous, anthropomorphic Magic Wand like a battering ram, while it looks surprised and blushes. <br />
                                    <br /> "What about using the Wand on a masturbation sleeve?" Chibi Hien asks confidently. <br />
                                    <br /> Realistically drawn and full size again, the camera looks down over head on the Wand head vibrating against the penis which is covered by the masturbation sleeve. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: The combination encased my entire penis in vibrations, which numbed it a fair amount. It felt strange!<br />
                                    <br /> Pulling the wand away temporarily, the reastically-drawn Masturbateer uses his free hand to slide the masturbation sleeve back and forth on his dick with a "sploosh sploosh" sound effect. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: But when I took the wand off, my sensitivity returned twice as much! I can see this working well in a fun edging or sensory play sesh!<br />
                                    <br /> Chibi-fied again, the tiny companion falls backwards in the arms of tiny Hien, the little guy is absolutely K.O.'d, as is the enormous anthro Magic Wand which lays on its side, blushing and catching its breath in bliss. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yet, my most favorite thing to do with the Magic Wand is actually much more mundane." Explains Chibi Hien as he supports his orgasm-unconscious companion. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> The entire page is washed over in a purple and yellow palette, reminiscent of candle light cast in a dark room. The full page is drawn realistically, it is planted firmly in the real world. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I've taken to offering Wand massages to friends, be it for intimate after-care, or simply because they'd had a long day. <br />
                                    <br /> A small overhead panel shows Hien's hand pushing the 'off' switch on a bedside lamp. In the next panel, his nude friend lays on his tummy on a bed, coyly looking over his shoulder at Hien, who sits on the edge of the bed. Hien rests one hand on his friend's hairy back while he holds the still Magic Wand in his other. The friends look at each other affectionately, with trust and contentment. <br />
                                    <br /> Overhead, the camera looks down on the back of the friend who is stretched out across the bed. His arms cradle the pillow that he rests his chin against. Slowly and deliberately Hien moves the vibration wand's head over his friend's back. The camera shows the wand pressing into his back from several floating angles. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Nothing but the Wand purring tenderly on labored skin. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Caption: Don't get me wrong, I love getting to touch and perve out while massaging, but...<br />
                                    <br /> "Hehe!" Hien laughs to himself as he gives his friend a squeeze on one bum cheek while he massages the other with his Wand. <br />
                                    <br /> "Mmm!" The friend coos. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: ...the act of care is what fills the heart. <br />
                                    <br /> With a "klik" Hien turns off the wand, looking satisfied. <br />
                                    <br /> "Whew!" He exhales, flopping back onto the bed next to his friend. <br />
                                    <br /> The yellow light bounces off Hien and his friend, who lay on their sides, facing each other. They both look calm and relaxed. The still wand lays between them. It almost resembles a holy scene.<br />
                                    <br /> "To be honest," He tells his companion. "it's fun conducting sexy science and all, but even if the Magic Wand didn't make me cum, I'd still love it. Its massaging capacity alone gives me a new way to show an intimate affection and personal appreciation for the people I care about. That is what I've come to treasure the most. That is the magic I've found."<br />

                                    <br /> Eli (they/them) draws with a vibrant, bouncy, cartoony style using a wide palette of colors. Everything about their art is energetic. The backgrounds reverberate with bold colors, sometimes using half-toned dots and other times as abstract shapes. <br />
                                    <br /> "nnNNN!" Sounds off a gagged Eli while bound with crisscrossing ropes to a wooden chair. Big, cartoony sweat drops fly off them from their effort to fight against their restrictions. They have multiple facial piercings, tattoos, and a dirty blonde mullet down to their shoulders with a big poof of bangs. A thick black collar with an O-ring fills up most of their neck and they wear a dark T-shirt with a giant gray star in the center, knee-length shorts, and thick cherry red work boots. A hint of short, soft hairs grows on their exposed legs and a smattering on their tummy. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: All About Gags a comic by Eli2B.<br />
                                    <br /> "MmPFNGH!" They struggle against their bounds. "nnNNNN"<br />
                                    <br /> Finally, they spit out their gag with a "PHWAH!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Gags!" They announce, with their demeanor completely transformed to that of a cool, calm, proud lecturer. "Of all BDSM things, they're definitely my favorite. And they've always been!" Stars of pride sparkle around their head. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> An assortment of different gags is displayed across the top of the page while Eli's chibi-fied face explains, "I've never had a moment when I saw someone and that was my sexual awakening. But something did awaken me, and that was GAGS! As soon as I saw one I couldn't stop thinking about it."<br />
                                    <br /> Most of the gags on display feature a buckled strap that goes around the sides and back of a person's head, while the front center section attaches to an object that fits into the mouth. <br />
                                    <br /> The gags displayed are: <br />
                                    <br /> - Bite gag: The gag is simply a cylindrical length of solid silicone with a bulb at either end.<br />
                                    <br /> - Bone gag: Same, but the bulbs on either end of the silicone length are doubled, to resemble a cartoony bone. <br />
                                    <br /> - Ball gag: The straps attach to a big round silicone ball. <br />
                                    <br /> -  Spider gag: A metal O-ring with prongs is attached to the straps. <br />
                                    <br /> - Dick gag: A short, fat phallus is the gag, designed to point inwards of the recipient's mouth. <br />
                                    <br /> - Muzzle gag: The design of this one is different from the previous ones, with a top and bottom set of straps that support a flat square-ish piece of material that would cover the recipient's nose and mouth like a mask. <br />
                                    <br /> - Inflatable gag: Using no straps at all, this gag resembles a pacifier that the user would hold in their mouth. A squeezey-ball and tube attach to the front of the pacifier. As the ball is squeezed, it pushes air through the tube into the flexible shape on the inside of the pacifier, inflating it to become the gag. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> The little chibi face of Eli narrates as it floats around an enormous, more-realistic illustration of themself with duct tape wrapped over their mouth. The big Eli looks calm and peaceful. <br />
                                    <br /> "And of course, by the time that I got into them the first time I already knew what I wanted to do! In every porn I ever watched I loved to see how cozy the actors looked when duct tape would wrap their head, jamming their jaw shut. I wanted to feel that."<br />
                                    <br /> The duct tape extends up over the top of their head, creating a tight cap over the dome of their head. The ends of the tape are sliced to resemble friendly fingers, reaching up and over to engulf their head.<br />
                                    <br /> "I wanted my face hugged by hands of tape too."<br />
                                    <br /> An off-screen voice says, "Stomp your feet if something is wrong, babe!"<br />
                                    <br /> "mh-hm!" Eli nods serenely. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Taking a more serious expression, the chibi Eli face tells us, "And I know that's not how it looks to some people. There can be this 'hardcore' vibe surrounding the practice of gagging someone."<br />
                                    <br /> A naked person is on all fours with a cartoonishly oversize tear drop by their eye. The rest of their face and posture are calm, so we know they are not actually in real distress. Their teeth bite down on a bone gag, their hands are in rounded gloves without fingers, a proud pony tail protrudes from their butt, they wear pointed animal ears on top of their head, and their neck is completely enclosed in a thick collar that is attached to a leash being held tightly by their companion. <br />
                                    <br /> "Suffer, you helpless fucker." Declares their companion, holding the leash taut in one hand while gripping the top of the submissive partner's head in the other. The dominant companion balances on one foot as they plant the other one firmly on the submissive's butt like a step stool. The dominant's eyes light up with stars and they smile devilishly as they laugh, "hehe"<br />
                                    <br /> "And don't get me wrong, I love hardcore BDSM..." Elisa2B's chibi head continues. "...but that's not what I like about gags!"<br />
                                    <br /> The chibi head now floats through a more realistic scene in a bedroom. Miscellanea litters a blue bedspread with a star pattern.  A handheld gaming console's screen shows a cartoony BDSM scene of a cat-hooded person licking a kind of zippered device. A stuffed toy cat rests by the pillow, along with a phone, cords, pencil, hair tie, and assorted little objects. Front and center of the scene is a person bound and gagged on the bed, with another person's hand gently resting on the side of their head. The bound person wears a muzzle gag that completely obscures their mouth. Two thick straps bind them around their shoulders and just below their breasts to restrict their forearms, which are tied behind their back. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's the feeling of shutting down the only way out for your thoughts. That's what does it for me." Explains the mini Eli head, looking fondly at the bound person. "The tenderness at play. Both in receiving and giving."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Floating into a new scene, mini Eli explains, "Every step of it feels sacred." <br />
                                    <br /> A different, more realistically-drawn person now fills up the top of the page. This person's arms are also bound behind them, but this time by shibari ropes. The person sits upright, looking up reverentially, reminiscent of a saintly portrait, as another set of hands gently pushes a rounded wad of material into the recipient's mouth. <br />
                                    <br /> "It can be intensely sexual," Eli's chibi head says, looking on as the model's head is now duct taped. We are standing over the bound person from behind, looking down on them as the offscreen partner's one hand pulls the roll of duct tape tightly around the kneeling person's head and the other hand firmly holds their shoulder in a move that is both bracing and supportive. "But it feels kinda spiritual too."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Time falls still and there's nothing but bliss.<br />
                                    <br /> In a very closely-cropped in panel, then hands  tighten the knot of a pink and blue-patterned kerchief under the gagged person's chin. A blue fabric has also been tied over the duct tape on their mouth. <br />
                                    <br /> "There we go." The voice belonging to the hands says. <br />
                                    <br /> "MmPH!" The gagged person replies. <br />
                                    <br /> "Perfect." Says the voice. <br />
                                    <br /> The camera pulls back to reveal from an overhead shot that Eli (in their realistic form) is the one tying up the gagged partner. They hold their partner's head gently in their hands as they say, "No way you will even remotely open your mouth now. Such a good boy."<br />
                                    <br /> "nMnh..." The bound person murmurs, closing their eyes contentedly and leaning their cheek into Eli's hands. <br />
                                    <br /> The mini Eli chibi head continues, "The only tension left is purely, unambiguously erotic. For me, it's more than just comforting. It's cathartic. It's the place where all worries cease to exist." <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Returning to the opening scene of the comic, we rejoin Eli with their white gag pulled just below their chin.<br />
                                    <br /> "SO!" They announce, unaware of the shadowing figure looming behind them with menacing stars for eyes. "This is why, on a desert island, gags are the one thing I'd bring with mMMH!" They are cut short as a red ball gag suddenly flies into their mouth. <br />
                                    <br /> "Didn't expect you to get out of that one so easily!" Coos Zoe, Eli's bespeckled partner. While their one hand adjusts Eli's shibari ropes, the other hand removes the white gag from around their chin. Zoe has shoulder length wavy brown-red hair, long eyelashes, tattoos, and sports a white tank top. <br />
                                    <br /> "mh-HM! nNN" Eli replies dreamily, their eyes closing in peace as little bubbles of zen-like happiness float near their face. <br />
                                    <br /> Lovingly,Zoe says, "Don't worry, I got you. Be nice and wait for me while I cook you dinner, ok?"<br />
                                    <br /> "m!" Chrips Eli.<br />
                                    <br /> "Such a good boy! ♥" Zoe commends them. <br />
                                    <br /> The slobbery white gag is left on the floor next to the words, "Thanks 4 reading!"<br /> Transcribed January 27, 2025 by Erika Moen<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Ripley LaCross draws in a simplified-realistic cartoon-ish style, using a color palette of white, gray, black, and blue. The present-day scenes look digitally drawn, with crisp, smooth lines. The philosophical scenes have a much more watercolored look to them with softer, pencil-y lines. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> From an overhead point of view, we see an office party taking place in a warehouse-turned-office building. Rain pelts down against the enormous windows that stretch up to the ceiling. Guests mill around tables of potluck food. It's an all-ages gathering, so parents try to talk with the other adults while simultaneously keeping track of their small children who are making friends with the office dogs. In the center of the hubbub stands Ripley who is talking with another person. Ripley's hair is bushy with the sides shaved down to stubble, making a relaxed mohawk or dapper mullet. They wear a black blazer over their collared blue shirt, with black pants and boots, with skinny glasses topping them off. They sport various facial and ear piercings along with a hint of mustache and beard against their white skin tone. Their conversation partner is shorter and plumper in a cute black mini cardigan over their blue patterned boxy dress that comes down to their knees. Underneath they sport black tights with their two-toned retro shoes. They wear slim glasses and theirs ears are full of many piercings that pop against their gray skin tone. They short black hair shares a cluster of big curls in front and then quickly fades into a buzz. <br />
                                    <br /> "Some shingdig, eh?" Ripley asks their friend. "I'm loving your outfit, by the way."<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh, I'm glad you like it!" The friend enthuses. The camera now drops down to an eye-level view of our speakers. "It was a last-minute thing, really." They manage to strike a little pose to show it off without spilling their drink. "This dress has a great pattern, but... it's actually on backwards! I figure this higher neckline and flatter cut gives me the shape and vibe I'm looking for. Though the tag's a bit itchy around my throat. Oh, the choices we *gender revels* make for fashion, haha!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Well, you still look great!" Replies Ripley. "Kinda makes me wish I could wear skirts again!"<br />
                                    <br /> With a look of realization, the friend asks, "Oh yeah! You used to wear them all the time, didn't you? Was it the dysphoria? Or...?"<br />
                                    <br /> The narrator's caption reads, "Ah... not entirely" over a smudging streak of blue that could either be the water running down a window pane or the view going into a softer, pulled-back focus to transition to another time. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> The entire white page is cut with a grey-blue watercolor pathway that snakes across and down it. The art style is the same as the previous page, but instead of crisp, clear digitally-drawn linework, it looks like everything is drawn with a softer pencil and painted with blue-gray watercolor paint on textured paper. Far in the distance at the start of the path is a hunched over, indistinct figure walking in baggy, ratty jeans and a hoody pulled up over their bushy, scraggly hair. Infinitesimally closer is the same figure, but now standing more upright, their bushy, short hair uncovered. They fidget with their fingers while continuing to walk forward, but now they are in a boxy knee-length skirt, fishnets, and big chunky boots. Music plays faintly in the background. The next figure continuing the walk wears a beret underneath big headphones that connect to a music player inside their purse. They wear a tanktop with a long skirt and flipflops. The next figure is close enough to show their face a little clearer now. Their shin-length hair flairs in almost-curls at the ends and they lift their multi-playered skirts to avoid tripping while they walk. They are clearly at a special event because they wear a pearl necklace with long opera gloves and fancy little high heels. This leads to the person with bangs and long hair that goes down past their shoulders. They wear a choker and multiple strands of necklaces. Their hands hold the straps of their backpack that they wear over their open, fluttering collared button-up shirt that flutters around their tight tanktop that tops their calf-length ruffled skirt and thick sandals. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: After the mess that was my teens, I wore skirts just as often as I did pants well into my thirties. <br />
                                    <br /> Decked out in Scene/Raver gear, Ripley takes a photo (with a slim camera) of the their next incarnation ahead of them. The picture-taking Ripley has big springy tubes added in their hair, wears round tinted classes, knee-high striped socks, canvas sneakers, a knee-length skirt with tanktop, a short scarf wrapped around their neck and lots of little bracelets. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: They kissed the earth, tickled my knees, and hugged my thighs. <br />
                                    <br /> The figure, who is now recognizably Ripley, poses for the camera with a joyful twirl in a fluffy knee-length wedding dress with a bouquet of flowers in their hand. Their long wavy hair bounces with the movement while their flowered fascinator holds the top in place. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I celebrated their simplicity, their comfort, and my right to choose them. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley hikes confidently along the trail, their hair in that bushy/shaved main from the first page but wearing an enormous camping backpack over their t-shirt. Their handkerchief is tied around their neck and they use two walking poles as they march in their hiking boots. Their knee-length cargo skirt reveals the scuffs on their lower legs. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Even after coming out as agender, skirts still felt like freedom. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley is much closer to the camera now, looking up in the air in surprise as rain starts to fall. Their hair is beginning to grow out from a buzzcut and they wear an N95 mask over their face and a pendant necklack rests against their chest. An unopened umbrella is tucked under their arm, resting against the knee-length, armless, pocketed dress they're wearing. Puddles from the rain are forming by their practical but stylish sandals. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I don't have a gender and neither does clothing. <br />
                                    <br /> Looking up at the rain with worry, Ripley begins opening their umbrella. They have disheveled short hair, the same necklace, thick black boots, and wear a calf-length dress with short sleeves and a v-neck. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Against the white background, Ripley huddles under their umbrella that is labelled "THEY/THEM/THEY/THEM/THEY/THEM" in blocky text while softly-written "She" and "He" words rain down against it in blue.<br /> "It's tricky being under the nonbinary gender umbrella when your culture is still very binary." Explains Ripley to us, looking vulnerable as the hem of their dress begins to soak up some of the raining "She" and "Her" words that were not blocked by the umbrella. The rest of the water and pronouns build up into a puddle by their feet. "And despite my beliefs, skirts and dresses are still very much skewed to one side of that binary."<br />
                                    <br /> Framed within a comic panel border, Ripley tries to hold their dress up higher out of the collecting water, but it's already up to their thighs. "She" and "Her" leach up through the bottom of the dress, out of the pool of water that continues to fill from the relentless rain.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: They were weighing me down. Anchoring me in the wrong gender through the eyes of strangers.<br />
                                    <br /> Back onto the open, blank page, Ripley falls to their knees in the puddle, their crumbpled umbrella tossed to the side and filling with rain itself. The gray blue watercolor rains down on everything as the bottom of Ripley's dress continues to absorb a dark inky blue from the puddle. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Ripley's damaged but repaired THEY/THEM umbrella overlaps the comic panel's edge, shielding them as they sit on a tree stump. The dress is gone, replaced with a t-shirt, jeans, boots, and a large-beaded necklace. The rain continues to pour down but the damaged umbrella keeps them covered and the tree stump keeps them elevated out of the water. They look over their shoulder with an expression of displeasure. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It felt like betrayal- rejecting what I love simply because of what other people may think of me. What happened to my rebellious spirit? My stubborn nature?<br />
                                    <br /> From overhead, we look down over Ripley as they look up at us defiantly, saying, "Regardless, I still get misgendered on the regular. But how much more often would it happen if I dressed the way I used to? The way I want to?" A giant "S H E" rain drop splashes against their hand that shields their eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> Back on level ground, we see Ripley from behind, still sitting on their tree stump with the umbrella handle balanced against their shoulder and neck so both their hands are free to clean their glasses. The rain pelts down, but they're still just high enough to be out of the puddle. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Some folks tolerate it better than others. Others embrace it. Every day we each make choices for our own comfort, and this is mine.<br />
                                    <br /> In the distance, a flurry of people dance and frolic in the rain with their own umbrellas. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The top quarter of the page is broken up into three distinct panels horizontally to each other. <br />
                                    <br /> The first panel contains the caption "Nevertheless..." with a view of a hand reaching down to Ripley under their umbrella, who in turn looks up at the hand in confusion. <br />
                                    <br /> The second panel is borderless against the white of the full page. From a distance, we see a new character, Eivor, standing confidently in the rain with their own THEY/THEM/SHE/HER/HE/HIM umbrella held aloft while the other hand reaches towards the seated Ripley who still huddles under their own repaired umbrella while sitting on the tree stump. <br />
                                    <br /> The borders return for the third panel, which shows their two hands reach for each other, their fingertips barely meeting over the caption, "...It maybe not be today, tomorrow, or even the day after that."<br />
                                    <br /> One single rectangular panel stretches across the width of the page, showing a close-up of Ripley's booted shoes firmly jumping into the puddle with a SPLASH that escapes the panel boundaries. <br />
                                    <br /> A medium-sized rectangular panel intersects with the previous splash, showing Ripley outside of a building, looking at it through one of the giant paned windows. The art is back to being crisp and digitally drawn. Inside the building, everyone is dancing in the rain with their pronoun umbrellas. Ripley's umbrella is nowhere to be seen, so the rain pelts down on their black blazer jacket.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But someday I'll feel free to weather the storm however I choose.<br /> Once again, all panel borders disappear, revealing a blank white page as a small Ripley briskly struts through the shallow puddles to the far right side of the page. The rain continues, but Ripley looks confident under their umbrella. "Who knows!" They say to us with a smile. "I may grow to like the rain and my umbrella. Gender can be fluid, afterall."<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Roxy Hana illustrates this fictional comic with a pallet of pinks and a bouncy, rounded, anime-inspired art style. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> "It's here!" Exclaims a curvy, 'thicc" young woman with curly pink hair cascading down her back. She is sitting on her comforter in her underwear, opening a box with her back to the reader. "Oh dear..." She says, looking in shock at the opened box. "What on earth did I buy this time..." <br />
                                    <br /> "OMG" Her word balloon reads over an enormous, thick, veiny realistic penis dildo with a wide base at the bottom. Magical stars shine around it.<br />
                                    <br /> Holding it in her hands, she muses, "You ambitious fool you... It's so big!" Holding it up to her eye line in wonder she continues while the little stars twinkle around it, "It'll never fit. No way."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Now sitting on her butt with the enormous donger braced upright between her thighs, she looks at it with awe and apprehension. She doesn't notice that the straps of her thin tank top are  falling off her shoulders and barely containing her large bosom. <br />
                                    <br /> Now looking cheekily to a point further away on the bedspread, she muses, "But it would be a shame not to try... I'll need..." The dildo now lays horizontally on the bed, joined by a bottle of lube and an open book with images of people's silhouette in various sexual positions together. <br />
                                    <br /> Pouring lube onto her fingers, she continues her previous sentence, "...to prepare..." Still seated, her underwear now dangles around on leg's calf as she slides her fingers over her exposed, smooth vulva. "...for this." Hearts erupt as she gasps, "AH!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> "I think I'm ready..." She says as a gloopy strand of fluids stays connected to her fingertips as she pulls her hand away from her cootch. <br />
                                    <br /> Now angling the head of the dildo between her labia lips, she steadies herself with a, "Here goes." and then a "It's so much..." as the head pushes further inside her. "Gotta keep... going..."<br />
                                    <br /> Still sitting on her butt, she looks tired as she leans back against one arm that she has braced against the bedspread while the other strokes the cock rhythmically inside her body. Though her tank top is still on, her underwear is long gone. A light sweat rolls over her chest. "OMG!" She pants. "I'm so tired, my wrist is killing me!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> In playful defeat, she pulls that glorious thick dick back up to her eye level, announcing, "You win, Mega-Dong." Her free hand massages her aching wrist. <br />
                                    <br /> Dildo in hand, she ambles pants-less to her bathroom, saying, "Maybe not the toy for me..."<br />
                                    <br /> In the sink, she runs her hands over her toy under a stream of water as she talks to it. "Let's get you washed up and-"<br />
                                    <br /> SLIP!<br />
                                    <br /> The slippery boner shoots out of her hands as she exclaims, "Whoa!" and then lands upright on the tile floor, squarely on its base with a THONK. The shaft swings back and forth but it is planted solidly to the ground and refuses to budge as she pulls at it, only eventually releasing its hold on the ground with a loud PLOP. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!" She realizes as she inspects the cupped base from the bottom. "You're a suction cup toy..." And then it dawns on her, OH!" <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> "Maybe if I..." She wonders as she presses the cock's base against the tiles of her shower's wall. Fully nude in the running shower, she bends over in front of the proudly mounted penis. "...give it one more chance..." Reaching behind to guide the waiting cock towards her presenting pussy. "UuH!" She exclaims, throwing her head back as she presses her butt to the wall, driving the dick into her deeply. "Ooh! Mmmh!" She moans while rocking back and forth on it. <br />
                                    <br /> "Wow-!" She gasps, now standing upright and lifting on leg with her free hand, while the other braces against the facing shower wall. "OOH! YES!!" The showers runs over her head as she fucks herself on the mounted cock. <br />

                                <br /> Shout-out to the team at <a href="https://uberrime.com/?rfsn=8389441.21ec44">Uberrime</a> and my friend Chris for making this comic possible! I know I can go pretty easy on my toy reviews, but these fantasy ding-dongs were really something special. I went out and got glass display cases for each of them! They’re too pretty to be stashed away in my nightstand.</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">In this lushly illustrated comic, artist Hien Pham switches between highly detailed, realistic drawings and simplified cartoons or chibis that emote exaggeratedly. The full spectrum of colors is used vividly throughout. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Four small rectangle panels are lined up horizontally next to each other and float above the page.<br />
                                    <br /> Panel 1 has a blue background and shows rendered globules of water floating through the air with the caption "Water"<br />
                                    <br /> Panel 2 has a green background, is filled with various leafy and grassy green plants, and is labeled "Earth"<br />
                                    <br /> Panel 3 is blue with white fluffy clouds, streams of lighter blues whooshing by in the background, a smattering of pink flower petals floating by, and is labeled "Air"<br />
                                    <br /> Panel 4 is a rich, bright red with a plume of yellow and orange fire erupting up in it, and labeled "Fire"<br />
                                    <br /> Chibi Hien explodes into the center of the page. He is a bald, bearded asian man wearing an open white lab coat, shirtless underneath, with hot-pink shorts and barefoot. "Only a master of all four elements can bring you this review of the three Uberrime fantasy dildos!" He exclaims as he soars through the air with pink action lines filling up the entire page behind him. In the foreground three fantastical dildos tower around him. The background behind them is filled with artistic renderings of the four elements, each color scheme echoing the color of a dildo. <br />
                                    <br /> The Teuthida Tentacle is a subtly curved, thick green and blue marbled tentacle, complete with two rows of suckers running along one side. The base of this dildo is simple and smooth. The basic model is $65 USD and extra colors can be added for $24.<br />
                                    <br /> Smaller but far more complex, the Ardor Dragon is an ornately molded phallus with a pinky-purple glans on top that is followed by a cascade of purple and blue dragon-y scales that tile down the shaft. The dildo transitions into a rounded bulge in the middle then immediately retracts onto a kind of textured thick stem that then again expands into a purely blue hued base that is covered by several rows of textured material. The base model costs $59 USD and extra colors are $24.<br />
                                    <br /> Thickest and largest, the Damn Jav dildo looks like a cock molded from lava. The classic penis features melt like wax into artistically sculpted curls around the mid section of the shaft. The orange, red, and gray marbled cock itself is mounted onto a grooved and scaley-textured base. This bad boy starts at $79 and costs an additional $24 for more colors. <br />
                                    <br /> Extra chibi-fied, Hien enthuses to the reader, "Many, many thanks fo the lovely team at Uberrime for making this comic possible! And many thanks to my good friend who helped me with my research!"<br />
                                    <br /> "We'll be your Masturbateers for this review!" Chime two nude chibi dudes behind him. <br /> Masturbateer 1 is a brown-skinned man with a full black beard and fluffy mohawk, while Masturbateer 2 is a fair-skinned man with short, brown wavy hair and a goatee.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Clinging to a larger-than-life sized tentacle toy, Hien enthuses with hearts filling his eyes, "I'm not gonna beat around the bush: the Teuthida is my personal favourite!"<br />
                                    <br /> A super chibi Hien chucks the enormous tentacle through the air at an anthropomorphised butt, which slurps it up through its mouth/anus. The Butt Face has big cartoon eyes on either side of its nose, which is made of a penis and balls. <br />
                                    <br /> "The tentacle shape was so easy for my tight bum to work with!" Hien says as he winds up his throw, and then as he pitches it he continues, "Its squishy Soft Shore density didn't give me that "full" feeling a solid plug would, which was a huge plus for me personally!"<br />
                                    <br /> Over a diagram illustrating the tentacle dildo going deep inside of an anus, Hien narrates, "The star of the experience was its texture! The suckers rubbed pleasantly on the anal wall and prostrate, like it was scratching an itch I didn't know I had. I couldn't take the entire toy, but I didn't have to in order to enjoy the sensory experience.<br /> The two Masturbateers return, each demonstrating a different position for receiving the toy, just as Hien describes it. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Positioning is key with this one, though. I found the tentacle to be most pleasurable laying on my back with the suckers facing up. I tested it with my friend on his kees, and he felt the tip poked him too prominently, which he didn't enjoy...<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> From an overhead POV, the reader sees Hien looking upwards with his fists joyously pumped in the air while he is overshadowed by giant copies of the other two sculptural dildos from the first page, one marbled in firey colors and the other in blues and pins. <br />
                                    <br /> "What he did enjoy, however, were the Ardor and the Damn Jav! Their bumps and knots really hit the spot!" He cheers. <br />
                                    <br /> Along with a series of illustrations showing a very chibi Hien inhaling and exhaling, the narration reads, "Imagine yourself stretching to breathe deeply, then feeling relief as you breathe out..." <br />
                                    <br /> Now the chibified Buff Face demonstrates inhaling and exhaling through its anus/mouth, with its cock and balls nose swaying with the motion, as the narration continues, "Now, imagine your butt getting that stretch-relief-stretch-relief over and over again!"<br />
                                    <br /> The tiny Hien hops up and down on the bottom-side fiery-colored base of the Damn Jav as it pumps away into the Butt Face's hole. The Butt Face's eyes fill with hearts and its penis-nose swings back and forth with each pump as it gasps, 'Ah! ah!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Each deep-plunging thrust with these dildos made my friend moan without fail! Their shaft-to-knot girth difference felt pretty forgiving compared to other monster cocks I've seen, which allowed me to pound him at a faster pace!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> with a more realistic style, Masturbateer 2 is shown reclining against hot pink pillows with his arms over his head under the narration, "Honestly, we just had a blast playing around with these toys! Each one explores a different dimension of anal play in varied depths, textures, and girths. <br />
                                    <br /> Cheekily, Masturbateer 2 asks with a little tongue sticking out, "Can I get you to try something?" <br />
                                    <br /> With the tentacle and the blue-purple toys side by side, he asks, "See if you can fit both of those in me!" <br />
                                    <br /> "You sure?" Masturbateer 1 asks eagerly, the toys in hand. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah!" He reassures him. <br />
                                    <br /> Overlaid over the previous and next panels, the narrator explains, "These toys decenter anal as a means to an end, rather, they place an emphasis on sensory experiences for sensory experiences' sake!"<br />
                                    <br /> With his butt presented and the two dildos ready to enter, Masturbateer 2 says, "Don't be afraid." Masturbateer 1's hands quiver a little in anticipation.<br />
                                    <br /> "Woah!!!" Explodes Masturbateer 1 in joy. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Everything from the colours to the sounds and shapes infuse an element of curiosity and fun to sex!<br />
                                    <br /> Masturateer 1 uses his hand to pulse the blue Ardor Dragon into his companion, just enough to get the head inside. Simultaneously, a Magic Wand vibrator buzzes away at the bottom-side base of the Teuthida Tentacle which has the top half of itself inserted inside Mastrubateer 2's eager butt. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Still in the more realistic art style, Hien observes while watching the Masturbateers continue, "There's not a lot I dislike about these toys, to be honest... The price points are on the higher side with the extra colours, but, I think the base costs are fair for solid hand-poured toys using premium materials." <br />
                                    <br /> Chibified again, Hien exclaims, "The important thing is picking a size that works for you! My Teuthida and Ardor are both small, while the Damn Jav's only available large!"<br />
                                    <br /> Chibi Hien floats through space along with the three different dildos that are easily four to six times as large as him and intricately rendered. Corresponding elemental illustrations and colors back each cock's different style- Earthy, geological art behind the magma-y Damn Jav, seaweed-y greens behind the tentacle, and a cloudy blue sky behind the Ardor Dragon. Chibi Butt Faces of the two Masturbateers joyously bounce around the scene as well.<br />
                                    <br /> "The Teuthida's grounded, passionate prostate probings won't disappoint folks looking for slower sensory play!" Cheers Chibi Hien. "Those wanting a more enthusiastic pounding should give the Ardor Dragon and the Damn Jav a look-see! If you're unsure about sizes and density, I'd recommend checking out Uberrime's Q&amp;A and their Instagram! I found their dildo production videos to be very helpful in that respect! Regardless of your chosen pleasure element, always remember to reach for water-based lube, and I'm sure you'll become a master ass-bender in no time!"<br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> DarkChibiShadow draws in a bouncy cartoony style with a color palette of soft teals, blues, and pinks. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> A generic person with no distinguishable features, hair, or clothing taps DarkChibiShadow on the shoulder while they are bent over their dinner tray-sized tablet drawing. "Hey!" The Generic Person (TGP) says aimiably. "Are you working on that comic again?" <br />
                                    <br /> DarkChibiShadow looks up from their hunched drawing position with a surprised smile. They have a bushel of spikey hair, thick eyebrows, rectangular glasses, and wear a dark t-shirt. "Yeah, just finishing up actually..." <br />
                                    <br /> The tablet's screen is filled with an illustration of a naked person sitting with their legs spread, cropped to their belly, thighs, and pubic area, which features a protruding fold of puffy flesh that would fit in a cupped hand. The figure has a smattering of hair over their thighs, pubic mound, and swoop of it running up the underside of their tummy. <br />
                                    <br /> "Y'know, I was wondering:" TGP asks, pointing at the illustration. "why is his clit so big?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh," DarkChibiShadow replies, now turning full toward their companion. "that's cuz he's taking testosterone."<br />
                                    <br /> Another illustration now shows two fingers of the same hand pressed on either side of a fleshy, puffy, testosterone-supplemented vulva that is accentuated with sparkling stars. The genitalia puffs out away from the body, about the size and shape of a cupped hand. Between the labia majora (the outer lips) rises up the clitoral hood, clitoris, and labia minora (inner, smaller lips). The clitoris and clitoral hood protrude far above the rest of the vulva, resembling the shape of a skinny, conical tent, with the clitoris at the very top and the labia minora running down one side.  <br />
                                    <br /> DarkChibiShadow narrates alongside the illustration, "Testosterone can grow the external and internal structure of the clitoris, resulting in what we often call a t-dick! People also call it a cock, dick, or clit, like you said."<br />
                                    <br /> In aw, TGP exclaims, "Whoa! It really does look like a 1-inch cock, doesn't it?"<br />
                                    <br /> DarkChibiShadowhastens to add, "Everyone is different, so be sure to double check in the future before referring to their bits!"<br />
                                    <br /> A little flustered, TGP blushes and quickly covers their mouth in self-consciousness, replying, "Oh, okay! Will do!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> With their chin in their hands and still looking flustered, TGP continues, "I guess I knew less about this than I thought..."<br />
                                    <br /> "Everyone starts somewhere." DarkChibiShadow says with a scholarly air as they grasp the pull-string on a rolled-up projector screen over their head. "Since you're here, let's keep learning!"<br />
                                    <br /> The projector screen unfurls to reveal diagrams of different vulvas with accompanying little hearts floating around them. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: Effects of testosterone on the genitals include...<br />
                                    <br /> DarkChibiShadow Narration: Clitoris (T-dick*) grows larger! The internal structure enlarges too! T-dick can now become a lot harder than before. A literal erection! <br /> *The "T" in "T-Dick" can stand for either "testosterone" or "trans" depending on who you ask. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: Before Testosterone<br /> Diagram: A generic vulva nestled between spread legs. The labia majora puffs a little bit away from the body to create a small mound with two gummy-worm-sized labia minora lips running down the center. The lips are merged at the top for the clitoral hood (which hides the clitoris beneath it) and the lips part towards the bottom, revealing a peek of the vaginal entrance hole beneath. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: On Testosterone<br /> Diagram: The same vulva as the previous diagram, but everything about it has been puffed up about two to three times bigger. The clitoral hood has grown from the width of a gummy worm to the width of  a finger, with a marble-sized clitoris siting high above the rest of the vulva. The labia minora and majora have increased in size and meatiness as well, all extending plumply away from the body.<br />
                                    <br /> DarkChibiShadow's Narration continues: Vaginal opening may become dryer or tighter. More pubic hair or thicker hair growth. Sensitivity may decrease or change in some way!<br />
                                    <br /> TGP stands at the bottom of the page, looking up at the giant screen projector diagrams, and asks, "So, how much growth should someone expect?"<br />
                                    <br /> "It depends!" Answers DarkChibiShadow, their hand still holding the pull-string of the screen. "The amount of testosterone may sometimes affect growth, but usually this is all genetic lottery."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Gesturing at a series of six different testosterone-supplemented genitals, DarkChibiShadow declares, "The average amount of growth is somewhere between 1/4th of an inch to 1 inch (1cm - 4cm) and sometimes more! <br />
                                    <br /> Different parts are accentuated or shrunk on each set of genitals. Some more closely resemble  standard penis and scrotum-shapes in a small size, while others resemble puffed-up standard vulva shapes, with some other examples of genital shapes and sizes falling in between the two extremes.<br />
                                    <br /> A hand gentle squeezes a large clitoris with thick hood-shaft between the forefingers while DarkChibiShadow narrates, "This growth can allow for a stroking motion and for folks to better receive oral that resembles what we typically think of as a blowjob."<br />
                                    <br /> An over-head shot shows a person sitting on the edge of their seat with their legs spread, t-dick puffed out proudly on display. The model's hand rests on the top of the head of a pink haired person who is at eye-level with the t-dick, looking at it dreamily before they put it in their mouth. <br />
                                    <br /> "Some people may even be able to achieve penetration, depending on their size and what they're trying to penetrate. Some surgeries can help with this too." DarkChibiShadow's narration continues over more examples of a t-dick in action. One shows someone pressing their t-dick against their partner's vulva. Somebody else uses a sheath to stroke along their t-dick. Another person person presses their fingers on either side of the base of their t-dick, while stroking it against their partner's vulva. <br />
                                    <br /> Still looking scholarly, DarkChibiShadow adds, "Still, lots of transmasc people choose to use a strap-on or prosthetic dick during sex." Behind them is an illustration of the lower region of a person wearing a strap-on harness with a bigger dick secured to it. "It all depends on the person's comfort."<br />
                                    <br /> "Sure, I get that!" TGP enthuses. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> DarkChibiShadow stands before us, flexing triumphantly and stating, "Personally, I didn't start T until I was 30 because of my own baggage, gender dysphoria and frankly, my own biases that made starting difficult. But, I owed it to myself to at least try, and wow, I'm happy I did! The changes testosterone has brought to my body have been amazing."<br />
                                    <br /> Now looking defeated, they sigh, "There are still things I wish were different about my body..." In the background we can see into their thoughts as they imagine the lower half of a naked person presenting a large t-dick that hangs past their pubic area. "But that's a feeling many people share, I'm sure."<br />
                                    <br /> Now crossing their arms into an X, they assert, "And remember, having gender dysphoria about your genitals like I do is not a universal experience for all trans people!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Over a montage of many different kinds of people and their t-dicks, DarkChibiShadow narrates, "Lots of transmascs love what they've already got and don't even take testosterone in the first place! Everyone has a different approach to how they do or don't want to transition, different words they prefer for themselves, and a unique relationship with their body. Every trans person is their own individual and you can't assume what's going on in their head."<br />
                                    <br /> Some of the people shown have had top surgery, some look typically masculine, some have breasts, some look feminine, some look androgynous, one wears cat ears with their pink wavy hair and collar, another wears a a leather pup play mask, balled gloves without fingers and a chest harness, one sports a butt plug along with their pierced labia minora, and another has both nipples pierced along with a small gauge in their ear lobe.  Giant t-dicks of all shapes and sizes fill in the empty spaces between the models. <br />
                                    <br /> "Of course!" Declares TGP, thumping their chest with their fist. "And thanks, I've learned a lot!"<br />
                                    <br /> "You're welcome!" replies DarkChibiShadow, now sitting back at their tablet display. <br />
                                    <br /> "Now, about that comic..." TGP begins to say. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh, right!" Chirps DarkChibiShadow, spinning their monitor around to show the comic they had been working on at the start of this story.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Todays comic was transcribed as a group effort around 12/29/24<br />
                                    <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Ripley LaCross draws in a simplified-realistic cartoon-ish style, using a color palette of white, gray, black, and red. <br />
                                    <br /> A small red cabin sits in a small clearing in the woods. A thin foot trail cuts through the deep snow, leading to the door while snow gently falls from the sky. <br />
                                    <br /> "See?" Says a voice from inside the cabin. "Told ya' I knew where we were going!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Never doubted you for a second, darling!" Another voice replies from within. <br />
                                    <br /> Inside the cozy one-room cabin we see a pair of travelers pulling off their snow gear by the open door. It is cramped in a welcoming way, with a big bed covered in heavy plaid blankets, a free-standing wood stove with a kettle on top, a basic kitchenette, a simple dining table with chairs, and rustic artwork and tchotchkes for decoration, including a set of mounted antlers. The red curtains on the four sets of windows and one camping lamp on the table are the only pop of color in this otherwise grayscale scene. <br />
                                    <br /> "Brr!" Dahlia shivers, opening her puffy winter jacket to reveal her own snow overalls underneath. Taller than Ezra, she is a black trans woman in her early-30s with an orchiectomy and her shoulder-length hair of braided rows pulled back into a loose half-bun. "All of this is ours?" She asks.<br />
                                    <br /> "Sure is!" Ezra replies as he pulls off his stalking cap and unclips his snow overalls. A white trans man in his mid-30s, he has short cropped hair, the outline of a beard, modestly-sized black plugs in his earlobes, glasses, and big cushy knitted winter sweater. The snow on his discarded boots have left some white crumbles on the cabin floor. "The perfect holiday getaway, complete with unlimited solitude and firewood."<br />
                                    <br /> Striking a match which explodes into a red flame, Ezra kneels at the stove saying, "Well, the sooner we get a fire going the better. I'm freezing!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Alternatively..." Dahlia coos as she unclips one of the straps on her snow overalls, revealing the decorative straps of a bright red lingerie brasier underneath. <br />
                                    <br /> Ezra looks over his shoulder from the stove as she continues, "You could have your present... early." At this, the wood inside the stove ignites with a FWOOSH. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Seductively, Dahlia strips off the rest of her protective snow overalls to reveal more of the lacy, strappy two-piece she's sporting. It's quite a contrast to see the elegant, decorative lingerie accentuating her curves combined with the thick, utilitarian snow pants and white and red winter socks that she still has on. The fire roars in the background. <br />
                                    <br /> "I thought we weren't doing gifts this year." Ezra smirks at her as he strokes her chin with his thumb. <br />
                                    <br /> "I changed my mind?" She blushes. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ah!" Gasps Dahlia when Ezra's hands make contact with her skin. "Your hands are FRIGID!"<br />
                                    <br /> "What other way is there to unwrap you?" He asks, playfully but confidently pushing her back onto the bedspread as she "Eeep!"s, she stockinged feet swept up off the floor. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> From Ezra's standing view, we look down to see Dahlia half laying on the bed with her arms propping up her top half. Her legs are spread and for the first time we see the entire lingerie set on display. <br />
                                    <br /> "Your mouth is warmer." She says while biting her lip and looking up at him coyly. <br />
                                    <br /> Taking off  his glasses, he replies "Patience..." with a hungry smile. "...I want to take my time."<br />
                                    <br /> Over a trio of panels that cascade one into the other, Ezra reaches one hand up under her bra as he kisses above her breast. "A-ah..." She moans, and then gasps "Nh- Ah!" when he expertly pinches both of her nipples underneath their lacy cover. He gives her a moment of respite with a gentle kiss just above the top straps of her underwear.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Tenderly he pinches the fabric between his fingers, pulling it up and off her pubic mound. "Is this also part of my present?" Ezra asks. <br />
                                    <br /> "It is." She replies earnestly with a look of eager anticipation and vulnerability. Little hearts surround her words. <br />
                                    <br /> "You know me so well." Replies Ezra with little hearts flurrying around his words as well as he takes the metal O-ring at the center of her panties in his teeth. The decorative straps strain as he pulls the ring away with his teeth. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ah!" Dahlia gasps. "OoOoohhhhh hhaa... Ahh!!" She moans as Ezra confidently laps away at her sex. She instinctively grabs the back of his head for support as she writhes. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> "Ooh oh! OoOOOooh!" The cries continue amid a flurry of hearts before both words and hearts are consumed in the roaring fire. <br />
                                    <br /> Next to the camping lamp on the table, we look across the room at our two lovers on the bed who are now recovering from their tryst. Dahlia reclines in just her bra and socks, the panties gone. Ezra, still fully clothed, leans near her with a hand on her leg. A festive holiday wreath with bobbles rings another set of decorative antlers high up on the wall. <br />
                                    <br /> "I can't believe you hiked the whole way here in lace." He laughs. <br />
                                    <br /> Resting her arms behind her head, Dahlia laughs, "What can I say? I'm a sucker for the dramatic."<br />
                                    <br /> The snow is picking up outside, the little red house stands as a tiny red point against the mounting white. <br />
                                    <br /> From inside, a voice says, "Well, I have a confession... I actually did get you something..."<br />
                                    <br /> Through the chimney comes a "BZZZZZZZZZ" sound. <br />
                                    <br /> "Aww, you shouldn't have!" The other voice declares from inside the cabin before it's lost to view from the snow-covered trees. <br />

                                    <br /> The Cast: <br /> Captain Higsby (He/Him) : A tall, chubby man with tan skin. His hair is a purple and curly, and his black mustache is done in two large points. <br /> Page 1<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Somewhere in the vast emptiness of space. <br />
                                    <br /> A red and blue chunky, angular spacecraft zips through the purple hue of space with two earth-like planets and another pink one in the distance.<br />
                                    <br /> "You just had to push this ol girl too hard, didn't ya?" A voice asks from inside the ship. <br />
                                    <br /> Inside the ship, we see Lt. Zex (They/Them) from their chin to their thighs. They are a pale, nonbinary person with bright, blue hair done in spikes. They are wearing a small pink halter top that only covers their breasts and a thong to match.<br />
                                    <br /> " 'We don't need the whole crew. We can pilot this rust bucket ourselves.' " Zex wails, mockingly. "Remember saying that, Captain?"<br />
                                    <br /> Only visible from his sweaty chest with pierced nipples down to the bulge in his gray boxer briefs, Captain Higsby answers, "You can't blame me for a faulty FTL drive! I can't believe you got me to agree to stealing this ship." <br />
                                    <br /> For the first time, we are given a full view of Zex and Higsby inside their ship. Their jumpsuits are strewn over the many consoles and operational controls while the two crew members sit on the floor sweating and in distress. Zex sits on their butt wears thick, purple tinted glasses and a single vertical stripe of blue lipstick that matches their eye shadow. In addition to their pink undergarments, they also wear knee-high striped socks to match. Higsby squats beside them, his hair is a purple and curly, and his black mustache is done in two large points. In addition to his boxers, he wears orange ankle-high socks.<br />
                                    <br /> "Apologies." Zex replies curtly. "With all the debt the crew is in, I didn't know we could be picky with jobs."<br />
                                    <br /> "We're in so much debt because you don't know how to pick jobs." He retorts. <br />
                                    <br /> "You wouldn't even have a crew if it wasn't for my charm and wit." They say, looking miserably hot and sweaty.<br />
                                    <br /> "How about we just drop this until the rest of the crew grabs us?" Higsby responds, looking the same. "Try and enjoy the little bit of cool air in here."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Now looking mischievous, Zex strokes their chin thoughtfully and muses, "Higsby, if I didn't know better... I'd think you did this on purpose."<br />
                                    <br /> "Wait, what?" Higsby asks, genuinely surprised. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's been forever since we could be alone." Zex continues teasingly. "You must have been missing me!"<br />
                                    <br /> "I wouldn't risk our lives just so we could fuck!" Higsby responds brusquely as he makes his way over to a console. "Kiss me ass, Zex!"<br />
                                    <br /> Standing up too, Zex follows him, playfully telling him, "I could have sworn you liked it more when I ate your ass."<br />
                                    <br /> Higsby's eyes widen as Zex's words catch him off guard. Recovering, he turns away from them, saying, "It's only because you're so good at it." <br />
                                    <br /> Zex drops down to be at eye-level with his full booty. Hearts emanate around them as they reply, "Only cause you've got such a great ass. Goddamn."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> His back still turned to Zex with his hands resting on a console counter, he turns his head to answer them in a softer tone. "Hey, I'm sorry for snapping." <br />
                                    <br /> "It's ok, Luv." Zex responds from her kneeling crouch on the floor, face still level with his butt though they are looking upwards to meet his gaze. "Heat got to you. I know you didn't mean it." Deftly, they slide his boxers down, revealing a soft, thick tan circumcized cock with slightly browner balls, and lots of body hair across his belly and legs- though not much on his actual pubic region. "Now, how about we release some of that stress?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah. Great idea, Zex..." Higsby agrees tentatively and then his eyes suddenly cross and squinch as he gasps, "O.. oh!"<br />
                                    <br /> His giant beefy dong now rock hard, Hibsby braces himself against the counter while Zex keeps their face planted squarely between his cheeks. From their spread-legged crouch on the floor, Zex plays with their own pink penis, jerking it with one hand while playing with their breast with the other. <br />
                                    <br /> "Get up..." He commands with a smile. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Their cock in hand, Zex turns their back and straddles the now-seated captain as they ask, "Mind if I take a sweat, Big Boy?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Hell yeah." Higsby responds with a huge smile and his cock gripped in his hand. He guides them to sit just behind his dick, so that Zex's legs straddle it on either side. "Bet you wanna take all of this, don't you?" He asks playfully. <br />
                                    <br /> "Y... yes Sir!" Zex says with a lusty look and biting their finger, letting their weight be supported by the captain's hands. <br />
                                    <br /> "Then let's see just how much you can take." He says as he guides Zex's hips downwards until the head of his cock meets their ass. <br />
                                    <br /> "F...fuck Higsby!" They gasp. A word balloon containing a heart and an exclamation point emanate from the meeting point of the cock and ass. Zex's own dick stands at upright attention, revealing the vertical row of rounded silver piercings running up the shaft.<br />
                                    <br /> "Right down to the hilt!" The captain declares as Zex's hungry ass swallows up his mega donger. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ahhh!" They exclaim. <br />
                                    <br /> From overhead, we get a top-down view of Zex riding Higsby. They lean forward and press their arms and hands back to push back against his barrel chest. Higsby braces his own back against the console and leans his head back with closed eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> "N... ow how about you just lie back and let me take over, hmm?" Zex asks without breaking their rhythme bouncing on that cock. "Gotta make sure these nuts are drained before the crew gets here..." <br />
                                    <br /> "Y... yeah!" The captain concurs over the sound of butt hole slamming down against balls with a juicy PLAP! PLAP! PLAP! <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> "Captain? Zex?" A worried-looking gray bug person with antennas comes into our view. Behind them are two more crew mates, one a kind of orange crab-thing with a single eye on a stalk and the other a pointy-earned fluffy brownish entity. All of them wear the same green utilitarian and zippered jacket tops and blue pants. <br />
                                    <br /> We now see that they are standing on the other side of a Star Trek-esque sliding door, from which muffled sounds are inscrutably emanating. <br />
                                    <br /> "They should be in here." The original crew mate states to their companions. "But what's all that noise?" <br />
                                    <br /> Meanwhile, on the other side of the door, Zex's purple glasses fly off their head as they exclaim, "Oh shit!" amid a sea of PLAP! PLAP! PLAP!s<br />
                                    <br /> "Are they in trouble?" The crew mate asks through the door. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yes! Yes! Fill me up, Captain!" Zex cries out, now riding the reclining Higsby in cowgirl style. "Don't you dare fucking pull out!" All the monitors in the room are now full of giant red exclamation points as the couple's PLAP! PLAP! PLAP! sounds fill the air until finally the two erupt in a fountain-like climax. <br />
                                    <br /> "It just got even louder!" The crew mate calls from the other side of the door. "We need to unlock this door, now! Don't worry, guys! We're coming in!"<br />
                                    <br /> Spent and lying flat on the floor, Higsby's eyes both swirl in spirals. His senses are returning enough to him that he can say "Oh no!" but he is still so fuck drunk that his mouth is frozen in an enormous just-got-fucked toothy smile. <br />

                                <br /> Thank you to Eric and <a href="https://www.nakedyogaaustralia.com.au/" target="_blank">Naked Yoga Australia</a> for my first experience with naked yoga! Thank you to the OJST team who worked with me on this comic, and thank you to everyone who’s read my stuff this past year! I am extraordinarily grateful that you’re sticking with us through these chaotic times. Here’s to 2025 and another year of amazing OJST comics! P.S: naked yoga is very respectful toward everyone’s privacy, so all folks except myself in this comic are comic characters, and any similarity to real-life appearances is purely coincidental.</p>

                        <strong>Matt’s Notes</strong>
                        <br /> I aught to make a real blog post about it – but this weekend I finally updated the website! With more and more higher DPI devices out there, we wanted to strip away a bunch of our sidebars and let the comic reign loud and proud. I hope you all like it? It’s been… a lot of work (the bones of this site are over 11 years old!) If you see errors or issues; feel <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/ojst-business/">free to ping me!</a> I figure I’ll be ironing things out for a month or two.<p />
                        <p>In the mean time, can I tell you about our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy" target="_blank">Patreon</a>? ;D<br /> It’s back UP, it’s <strong>WORKING!</strong> They couldn’t keep us down for long (if you were out of the loop, we’ve been on the receiving end of some banning/censorship on most of our platforms this past month!). Want to see me continue to hire artist to tell their intimate and amazing yoga stories? Consider committing to a coffee a month – and I promise to put it to good work!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">As described by the artist; Hien Pham is a bearded, bald, fat Asian man wearing glasses and who has spots and scars on his butt.<br /> He draws in a cartoon-y but realistically rendered style with the full spectrum of colors.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> A little nervously, Hien undoes the buttons of his red shirt and takes a glance over his shoulder. As he pulls down his white boxers we see that he is undressing in the back of a yoga studio, by the shelves for patrons belongings. In the foreground, he is framed by the arms and upper legs of two seated, hairy figures. One last time for luck, Hien quickly ruffles his fingers through his short beard hairs, gives them a gentle tug and then exhales calmly. <br />
                                    <br /> "Welcome, everyone, to naked yoga." Greets a voice off panel to the assembled variety of men sitting on their yoga mats on the floor. They have a diverse range of skin tones, builds, and body hair. Hien sits in the center of the group with his legs crossed and his hands resting over his ankles. He looks excited and nervous at the same time. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> "This is a non-sexual experience." The speaker continues. He has light brown skin, short curly/wavy brown hair, and a modest beard with mustache. We are given an overhead view of the yoga studio, which shows the men sitting on their yoga mats and their reflection in the wall-length mirror to the side. The studio is lined with leafy green plants that frame one side of the panel. "We are just a regular yoga class with the distinction that we're naked. I assure you that within five minutes of practicing, you'll almost forget that you're naked! This class is very much about dismantling body shame, and we are inclusive of all different body types. Things pop up from time to time, and if that happens, it's honestly fine to keep practicing. Or, you can lay on your belly, or return to Child's Pose, and things will usually resolves on their own. <br />
                                    <br /> "Doing this takes courage, and I admire everyone in the room for being here today." The instructor says as Hien leans back a little to take a peek at his reflection in the mirror. <br />
                                    <br /> Again, Hien nervously ruffles his fingers through his beard. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: For someone who's written so many stories on body positivity and self-acceptance, I feel like I'm still fighting shame on a daily basis.<br />
                                    <br /> "We'll start on our knees, with our hands pushing parallel down from our shoulders..." The teacher instructs the class, who move onto all fours calmly and confidently, eyes closed- aside from Hien, who looks up anxiously at the instructor. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I feel so many things, so much, all of the time. <br />
                                    <br /> On all fours, Hien seems to be the only one swaying and wobbling amongst his still classmates. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Every little comment still gets to me. Everything still hurts so deeply.<br />
                                    <br /> Wobbling, Hien extends his left arm straight in front of him and his right leg behind, like the rest of the men around him. He closes his eyes in concentration. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The world at large continues to have a fascination with appointing a lack of morality to the width of my hip and the size of my penis. <br />
                                    <br /> In a close-up, we see Hien's elbow and thigh pull towards his center, while still balancing on his opposite hand and knee. Delicate traces of sweat roll along his body. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It's an argument that feels impossible to win.<br />
                                    <br /> From overhead, we focus on his hand that is planted firmly on the ground, pressing into his yoga mat, as he lightly quivers and sweats. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Hien's narration floats across a montage of panels of him going through his yoga motions, all from different points of view. Some images we are above him, looking down, while others are close-ups at off-center angles. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I've never been to a yoga class before much less a naked one. I didn't realize how much of a respite it was. <br />
                                    <br /> On both knees, he keeps his hands planted in front of him and pulls his torso backwards, creating a prostrated bow. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: In this space, I feel like a pressure is lifted. Like the necessity for my body to be a point of external interest, sexual or otherwise, is removed.<br />
                                    <br /> The tops of his feet press into the mat, supporting the weight of his butt with just a peek of balls hanging between them.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: All that matters is how I can wield my body, what I can feel with, and within, it. <br />
                                    <br /> We join Hien close-up as he lets his head bow between his outstretched arms and the rest of his torso's weight pulled back over his bended knees. For the first time on this page, our view is parallel to him, not soaring overhead at odd angles. It's the first moment of balance we share with him. <br />
                                    <br /> The camera returns to an overhead, off-center, close-up view of him planting his feet on the mat and starting to straighten his legs while leaving his fingertips still resting on the floor. He still wobbles a little to keep his balance, but it's much more controlled than before. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I don't feel like I need to win any argument today.<br />
                                    <br /> Eyes closed and cheeks flushed, Hien exhales calmly as traces of sweat roll down him. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Narration: During the Warrior's Pose, we all turn to face the mirror-lined wall. <br />
                                    <br /> The panel is divided vertically down the center, with the left showing the reflection of the rows of men in the mirror, and on the right are the real rows of men. We are behind them, so we see their full backs and butts. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I see the burn in my calves, the ache in my knees, the sweat beading down my face. <br />
                                    <br /> From just over Hien's ear, we follow his gaze over a classmate to find his own reflection in the mirror in the distance. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But most of all, I see a glimpse of a space that was carved out especially for me... A crowd of people who are already on my side...<br />
                                    <br /> Close in on Hien's reflection, he makes a silly face at himself- sticking out the tip of his tongue and giving himself a wink. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And I see a self that is mine, feeling perfectly fine naked.<br />
                                    <br /> Hien's back torso towers over us, filling up the entire bottom of the page. Our view is from the ground, looking up at his butt, back, spread arms, and the underside-back of his head with his hair pulled into a bun. Sweat delicately runs down his body but his body is no longer wobbling, he holds perfectly still and glows as if illuminated by the sunlight. He looks strong and solid and beautiful. <br />

If you’ve been a little looped out; this month we’ve been trying to weather some sort of attack on our socials. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and even Patreon have been coming at us hard with some sort of censorship addenda. We’re still around, and with our Patreon back up; still alive and kicking! But it serves as a remidner; come and follow us on our other socials!<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> Eve Breng's draws her characters with a simple, thin, clean line and then adorned with detailed decorations, like hair, flower crowns, and fabric. The environment is colored with soft teals and blues, while the characters each have a skin tone that pops against the backgrounds. There is one human woman (she/her) with light brown skin and wavy/curly shoulder-length purple hair, a water nymph (she/her) with light pink scaled skin and long straight blond hair that goes past her long pointed ears and down to her bottom, a rose-pink mermaid with thick wavy dark pink hair that tucks behind her fin-like feathered ears and past her shoulders, and a purple mer (they/them) with scaled skin, fringed ear-fins, plant-like scars over their pectorals, and long straight blue hair that reaches down to their bottom. Both mer people have beautiful fish tails with flowing scalloped fins.<br />
                                    <br /> In secluded woods kneels our human protagonist, fully nude and peering into a lily-pad covered pond. The air is alight with glowing specs of magic and the branches of the trees in the background grow in almost lace-like patterns. It is beautiful and serene. <br />
                                    <br /> "SIGH." Sighs the woman. <br />
                                    <br /> Breaking through the pond's surface, a nymph in a flower crown and white draping toga appears just under our human's face, asking, "Darling, you look upset! What is it?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Aah!" The human moans, dramatically throwing her arm over her eyes to express peak emotional torment. "I am horny and have no one to fulfill my needs! And I'm so broke I cannot afford any of those fancy toys other people have..." Gesturing to the sky with begging hands, she cries, "I'm desperate!"<br />
                                    <br /> Taking the human's tanned brown hand in her own light pink one, the nymph reassures her, "Oh! Fear not, for you probably have everything you need! Come!" She says, guiding her lady friend into the pond as the magic specs and dragonflies glow around them. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Two mer people join the nymph and the human, all standing about waist-deep in the pond. The purple mer person has their hand on the handle of an ornate faucet that is surrounded by lavishly sculpted, curling fish and undersea plumage. The pink mermaid guides the hose that is attached to the faucet over to the nymph, which is topped off a the end with a shower head that sprouts an aesthetic display of water drops. <br />
                                    <br /> "Let me introduce you to the joy of..." The nymph tells the stunned human, who looks on at the object in wonder. <br />
                                    <br /> In elaborate text and surrounded with floral and oceanic accents, the title reads: The ShowerHead!<br />
                                    <br /> "Eep! It tickles!" The human shrieks playfully when the nymph turns the gentle water shower at her while the pink mermaid peaks mischievously behind her back. <br />
                                    <br /> "Now let's get to business! Let's change the setting to « massage » and..." Announces the nymph, deftly twisting a part of the shower head to turn the gentle shower in a concentrated stream.<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!" The human reacts as the water jet blasts into her cupped hands. "That's more than tickling! I get why it's called massage!" She says as her eyes turn into swirls of surprised delight. <br />
                                    <br /> "Heehee! Now take it!" Laughs the nymph as she hands the shower head to the human's hands. "But be warned!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> As she hands the shower head over in one hand, the nymph forlornly brings a nearby pink waterlily to her face as she warns, "Do not EVER put the stream in your vagina or any other hole! Water pressure like that can cause all kinds of damage, so play safe!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yes, of course!" The human replies sincerely, her fingertips barely brushing against the hand of the nymph that is holding the shower head, which continues to pump out its solid stream of water. <br />
                                    <br /> The nymph leans in close to whisper into the human's ear, her lips almost brushing against her cheek, "You know what to do..."<br />
                                    <br /> At last the shower head is in the human's hands and she plunges it below the water's surface with a medium-sized SPLASH. While the human blushes with wide eyes, the mer people flank her on either side looking expectant and excited. Under water, she positions the shower head a few inches above her vulva so the water jet blasts straight onto her bean-sized clitoris. Her purple pubic hair curls elegantly on either side of her labia. The mer people support her underwater, holding her aloft so she can continue to breathe above the pond's surface. She drapes on leg over the purple mer person's curled tail, with her free hand pressed against the creature's shimmery-scaled back as they, in turn, use their own purple hand to gently tease the human's breast. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ooh! It's really nice!" She exclaims to the pink mermaid who supports her on her other side. "The feeling of hot water, the pressure...! Aah! It's as if I'm being caressed, but the sensations are truly unique! What if I move at the same time? ...aaaAAAHHHH!!!" She cries out and then immediately pulls the shower head back above water while its jet continues to flow. "But wait!! I don't have a showerhead with this kind of setting at home! Mine is just a plain old one!" <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> "Well, if you've got at least a hose you can always take the standard showerhead..." The nymph narrates over a diagram of the shower head being unscrewed from its hose. "And then..." Holding the hose so the water stream blasts straight up like a little fountain, the nymph says confidently, "There you go! Easy!" While the human claps her hands in delight. <br />
                                    <br /> Bringing the hose down between her legs, the human leans back into the support of the purple mer and moans, "Ooh!! Wow!! This is even better!! Like a super powerful laser beam, with so much more pressure! I LOVE IIIT!!!" Little hearts emanate around her head as her cheeks flush. <br />
                                    <br /> Plucking a pink water lily, the nymph explains, "Yup! We've found that it's different for everybody... Some like it gentle and caressing, others like to pull away the stream a little to have a slower build-up, and other even add a dildo!"<br />
                                    <br /> From off screen, we hear our human erupt in pleasure and primal release. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> "How as that?" Asks the nymph, leaning in close to the recovering human's flushed face. <br />
                                    <br /> "Aah... Perfect!" She gasps, little hearts still emanating around her head. <br />
                                    <br /> "Good! Now you can go back to your home..." The nymph declares with a kiss on her lips. "And you'll know what to do whenever you need!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh yes!" Agrees the human as she climbs back onto land, looking over her shoulder at her watery friends. "Thank you!"<br />
                                    <br /> The nymph takes a minute to bask in the glow of success, resting her head in her hands while little hearts sparkle around her head. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh woe is me!" A voice pierces through the moment, catching the attention of the three water people. A person in a long flowing sea foam green toga stands dramatically at the edge of the opposite side of the pond. Their arm is flung over their eyes in despair, just as our protagonist had done at the beginning of the story. "I'm so horny and haven't had sex in so long!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Another soul to save!" Exclaims the nymph as she and her shimmery, magical crew swim to the new human. The hose elegantly trails behind the group, entwining with her flowing toga and their mer tails. Above the water she holds the attachment aloft towards the human's reaching hand. "Madam, let me introduce you to... The Showerhead!"<br />
                                    <br /> The sky is filled with the glow of dragonflies and magic. <br />

                        <br /> No joke, but this comic was a couple of years in the making; it takes so much sweat to make something like this, and Erika and I aren’t spring chickens any more! It means so much to us that you found your way here and hopefully used the list to find a toy. We took the chance at the end of todays comic to plug our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy" target="_blank">Patreon</a>! It’s the heart that keeps this site going, so if you want to see us keep making comics, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy" target="_blank">please pop on by and support us!</a>

                        <strong>Matt’s added note!</strong>
                        <br /> This week I want to call out and thank our amazing long-term supporter <a href="https://daviddlevine.com/" target="_blank">David D Levine</a>! He writes sci-fi steampunk fair that’s pretty gosh darned fun, while also supporting independent creative organizations such as ours. As we move into 2025 during a turbulent time (this week our new Reddit was suspended, Tumblr let us know they’d not restore our page, our Facebook remains under censorship attack, and just yesterday our Patreon has been temporarily suspended (hopefully only for a day or two), <strong>David is helping us keep the lights on.</strong> If you’re feeling generous, go take a <a href="https://daviddlevine.com/" target="_blank">peek at some of his work</a> this week!<p />
                        <p>David isn’t the only one! I owe Violet Olson and Ryan Hill both huge thanks yous too for the continued support. They’re the other two faces, along with David’s, on the left side of the site and are both amazing, kind and generous. Truly this month has been a doozy, but having such supportive company on our side of the fence has kept us sane and alive. </p>
                        <p>FINALLY a lil reminder of all the places you can still find and follow us at!<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Ripley LaCross draws in a realistic-ish cartoony style, using a color palette of orange, orange-red, black, white, and gray. The author is a nonbinary person who uses they/them pronouns and sports glasses, shaggy orange hair, and a smattering of facial hairs. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> An assortment of panels show well-organized spots around a house. A drawer is pulled open to reveal neatly folded and horizontally stacked clothing. Containers on a desk hold sorted pens and mechanical pencils. Petite plastic drawers are labeled with their contents. In a closet hangs black t-shirts on one side and black hoodies on the other. Jars a labeled with their different rices. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Ever hear that joke, "Their idea of an exciting Saturday night is organizing their sock drawer?" That person is *me*. It brings me peace to bring order to disorder. (And these days I'll take it where I can get it.) So if this is how I  live my life...<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley kneels at an open box on the floor, gesturing in disgust at the sexual paraphernalia erupting from it and spilling over the sides as they shout at us, "...Why the hell is my sex toy boy such a FUCKING MESS!?"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Narration: It's not for lack of desire, it's just, y'know, out of sight, out of mind! Heck, even during playtime I hardly see it.<br />
                                    <br /> In the dark, Ripley dangles over the edge of their bed, squinting as they try to discern one dildo from the other as they pull them from their sex toy boy. <br />
                                    <br /> "...You need a hand down there?" Asks a voice from the other side of the bed. <br />
                                    <br /> "No! I mean, maybe." Replies Ripley in frustrated concentration. "I can't find Little Blue... THEY'RE ALL BLACK IN THIS LIGHT."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I think it's time to treat myself to a makeover. <br />
                                    <br /> Now well-illuminated in the light of day, Ripley sits in bed thumbing through their phone. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: For inspiration I of course took to the Internet, and there's some real above and beyond stuff out there.  But let's be real, most of the stuff that makes it online is flashy, expensive, or just plain silly. <br />
                                    <br /> Cocking their head, Ripley asks their phone, "Are those dildos hanging from a wine glass rack...?"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Striking a jaunty pose as they gesture with their hand, Ripley informs us, "I'm a simple, cheap dude. I don't need a velvet-lined, leather-bound, standing trunk with bells, whistles, and a lube warmer. I only want something that meets my needs." <br />
                                    <br /> As an aside, a chibi version of Ripley ponders a bottle labeled LUBE next to a steaming mug labeled NOT LUBE which sits upon a corded heating coaster. "(Though a lube warmer would be cool, could use it for coffee...)" They observe. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: SOME IDEAS: A Tool Box<br /> Next to an illustration of a classic toolbox with fold-out compartments is a list of details, reading:<br /> +Easy to clean<br /> +Inconspicuous<br /> +Can cover in stickers!<br /> +Travel-ready<br /> -Not very big<br />
                                    <br /> A mini-Ripley leans against the toolbox, holding a hammer by its head so the handle points proudly into the air like a phallus. They say, "Incredibly on-brand for me."<br />
                                    <br /> Title: That Vintage Trunk I saw at the Antique Store Last Week<br />
                                    <br /> An old-fashioned steamer trunk with a removable compartment is accompanied with the list:<br /> +Super cool<br /> +Removable tray<br /> +Large capacity<br /> -Smells funny<br /> -Has it ever been cleaned?<br />
                                    <br /> Now in pirate-garb with a hook for a hand, Mini Ripley adds "Yarr, like a treasure chest!"<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Well-Known Swedish Store Under-Bed Drawers<br />
                                    <br /> Two rectangular drawers with little rollers under their corners sit side-by-side, accompanied by the list:<br /> +Blends in<br /> +XL Capacity<br /> -Expensive<br /> -Blocks power outlets<br />
                                    <br /> An extremely simplified, stylistic humanoid illustration appears, the only way we can tell it's Ripley is because it has several orange hairs on its head and wears glasses. "Most of my room is IKEA anyway, may as well!" They chirp. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Lil' Ripley stands with a very fancy large container, holding part of its top open with one hand. It is large, flat-ish, rectangle with wheels at each corner and many, many removable, modular mini-containers within it.<br />
                                    <br /> "Ultimately, I chose a system that's a little basic, but perfect for me!" Says Ripley with a thumbs-up. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: Generic Under-Bed Storage Bin<br />
                                    <br /> List accompanying storage bin:<br /> +XL Capacity <br /> +Lid stays attached<br /> +Removable, dishwasher-safe trays<br /> +Easy to clean<br /> +Color-coordinated satin bags<br /> +Landing tray for dirty toys<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: HOT TIP: Shoe bags, tarot bags, and wig bags are the same as bags sold for sex toys, but without the upcharge!<br />
                                    <br /> Stretching out next to the open container which now holds sexual accoutrements in a nice, orderly fashion, Ripley explains as they point out various compartments, "It's so beautiful, I may just have a brain-gasm. Look, all the random charging cables go here... Lube n' stuff lives right here... Booty business goes over here... Each toy gets a new bag and a dedicated home. Struggling to find something in the dark will be a thing of the past!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Fully in the buff, Ripley sits  on their bed with several sex-toy-filled containers around them, plus the container with two bottles of lube that they hold in their hands as they tell us confidently, "Since I'll know where everything is, playtime will be easy-breezy. Just grab my trays of choice and go to town!" The "landing tray" sits empty next to them. <br />
                                    <br /> Now in the bathroom, Ripley is in the process of sliding used toys off of the tray and into the sink with running water as they continue, "Dirty toys get quarnatined on their own tray and it all gets washed at the same time. I'm all about efficiency."<br />
                                    <br /> "And then!" Ripley announces, standing over the completely closed-up storage box which looks incredibly discreet. "The best part! When evertying's clean and ry... it all goes back where it belongs! Inner peace frickin' ACQUIRED!" Stars and accentuations marks shine around this marvelous box. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley's phone fills up with the selfie they've just taken of them and the organized contents of their storage box while they wink and give the peace sign. Emoji stickers of stars and a tongue-sticky-outty-face adorn the image, along with the caption, "Just another WILD Saturday night!!"<br /> Transcribed by Erika Moen on November 18, 2024<br />

                        <p>Today’s script was a collaborative one between our regular artist Hien and our behind-the-scenes editor Ziggy! I think I think it really turned out lovely. Seeing real human (sorry; <em>furry</em>) conversations like this is maybe one of my most favorite kind of comics. It’s a level of shared personhood that feels like the pinnacle of what comics can do. A huge word of thanks to both Artist Extraordinaire Hien Pham and our editor powerhouse Ziggy!</p>

                                <br /> Thank you to my editor Ziggy for sharing his stories and working on this comic with me! Thank you to Matthew as well for your editorial feedback as always! This is my <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/hienpham/">40th comic with OJST</a> and I haven’t stopped feeling so honoured working with every single person on the team. Oh, and another special shout-out to Woody for giving me the special moment that blossomed into this comic &lt;3. Last but not least, thank you to <a href="https://uberrime.com/?rfsn=8389441.21ec44" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Uberrime</a> for the fantastic fantasy dildos that I can’t wait to review!</p>

                        <strong>Some NEWS about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OhJoySexToyComics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook</a>!</strong>
                        <br /> I usually harp on at the end here and promote the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>, but this week I wanted to address the not-so-quiet elephant in the room that is Facebook. A great deal of you have been reaching out to let us know that in the past week, OJST posts (even a decade old) are being removed from Facebook pages. We’re not sure why, other than it seems wide reaching and timed alongside a great swath of other anti-right, pro-left advocacy groups getting the same treatment. This isn’t our first rodeo being blackmarked or attacked for our values- heck a month ago Tumblr deleted our account without warning or reply. <p />
                        <p>While we’re not quite sure what to do currently (other than keep posting our comics/censored feature images), here is a reminder that<strong> we can be found elsewhere online,</strong> especially if we suddenly disappear from your feeds!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Hien Pham draws in a cartoon-y realistic style with the full spectrum of colors. Today's comic, and specifically the script was a collaborative effort between Hien and Ziggy.<br />
                                    <br /> Character Descriptions:<br /> Hien: Brown bear with a beard and a hair bun.<br /> Ziggy: Spotted hyena with round glasses, nose ring, and ear gauges.<br /> Hien's friend: Ginger bear with a full fluffy beard.<br /> Ex 1: Sleek doberman in a bathrobe. cis guy, he/him. <br /> Ex 2: Leather-clad lion with his mane tied back. cis guy, he/him.<br /> Ex 3: Kinky cat,  trans woman, she/her <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Through a pinky-purple-y tinted video chat window, Hien proudly holds up a bouquet of fantastical creature dildos that look more like art pieces than sex toys. "Ziggy!" He exclaims. "Check these out! I just got these in for a review!"<br />
                                    <br /> In a green tinted video chat window, Ziggy replies, "Whoah, those are gorgeous! Are they all for the site?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah!" Hien replies, twirling his treasures around like glow sticks at a rave. "I've got a couple of bottom bears excited to help me test 'em out, hehe!" He sticks his tongue out in silly anticipation of the upcoming good times.<br />
                                    <br /> "Lucy you!" Says Ziggy. "Got a queue of willing test subjects outside the door, huh?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Naw! Just a couple of close friends!" Hien responds. "Surely you have an entourage of your own toy enthusiasts over there?" <br />
                                    <br /> Demurely, Ziggy answers, "You'd be surprised! I haven't always had the easiest time bringing toys into the bedroom." <br />
                                    <br /> Hien is boggled. "Really?!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah, a couple of my exes were kinda OFFENDED by them." Ziggy says with a shrug. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> In a sepia-toned flashback we see Ziggy and his doberman in a bedroom. <br />
                                    <br /> Lounging on the bed, the doberman seductively asks, "Wanna try something new tonight?"<br />
                                    <br /> "I thought you'd never ask!" Exclaims Ziggy, already diving to pull open the sex toy drawer in his nightstand. A giant vibrator, butt plug, and a wearable small vibrator come flying out. <br />
                                    <br /> Bursting into tears, the doberman sobs, "W-whyyy do you hate my penis?!? I just wanted to top for once!!!"<br />
                                    <br /> Horrified in the background, Ziggy stammers, "That's not what I meant..." <br />
                                    <br /> In a different flashback, Ziggy is out window shopping at the sex store with his lion companion. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ooh!" Ziggy gasps in delight, pressing his snoot and hands up against the window where a glorious, giant butt plug with a luxurious flowing ponytail is upright on display. <br />
                                    <br /> "Absolutely not." The lion says cooly. "That's way too gay."<br />
                                    <br /> "TOO GAY?!" Ziggy responds in complete surprise. "But you love it when I-"<br />
                                    <br /> "HAHAHA I don't know what you're talking about!!!" The lion cuts him off with great nervous anxiety, looking over his shoulder and clamping his hand over Ziggy's mouth before he can finish. <br />
                                    <br /> Back in the present day with full color, Hien responds, "That's a big YIKES from me!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah, those relationships did NOT last!" Ziggy responds with a shrug. "Sounds like your dildos came about from a happy story though, eh?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Welll..." Begins Hien. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> The scene turns sepia once again as we dive into Hien's flashback with his bear friend. The two of them are chatting excitedly as Hien shares what's on his phone. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I wanted to top an intimate friend of mine, but not with my penis. So we went online to pick out a dildo to play with..." <br />
                                    <br /> "I really like the more fantastical ones!" Hien tells the bearded ginger bear with a coy, eager look. <br />
                                    <br /> "Me too!" His friend agrees. "We're not looking for your replacement, but something entirely new to experience together." <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: That moment really stuck with me. I was so moved.<br />
                                    <br /> The full color of the present day returns to the scene with Hien reminiscing dreamily, "It felt so affirming, like he understood me in a deeply personal way." <br />
                                    <br /> "Awww!" Coos Ziggy. "You wouldn't expect it, but toys def have the power to enable connections between people!" <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> In Ziggy's sepia-colored flashback, his narration reads, "Like, I remember I had a partner who was really into sensory play. She loved soft, smooth sensations, but I'm super ticklish, so they didn't work for me..." Feathers, a flogger, a paddle, a pokey tool, and a multi-wheeled rolling tool are laid out on a surface, all tinted brownish. A single pinwheel tool stands out against the rest in shining white. "...until we tried a pinwheel! Game changer!" <br />
                                    <br /> Ziggy squeezes his eyes shut in pleasure and light pain as a hand drives the pinwheel up his back, leaving behind a trail of little pokes. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Even though we each liked a different type of sensation, being able to share that sensory experience really brought us together. <br />
                                    <br /> Ziggy's hand runs a feather boa across his kitty-friend's back, who is lost in happiness. <br />
                                    <br /> The flashback ends, bringing us back to present day Hien and Ziggy in full color. <br />
                                    <br /> "The toys brought you an understanding of your then-partner in a way you wouldn't have had access to otherwise!" Observes Hien. <br />
                                    <br /> "When you keep an open mind, toys can do so much beyond just sexual pleasure." Closing his eyes in thought, Ziggy concludes, "I wish my exes could have seen the potential that I saw in sex toys." <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> From out of nowhere, Hien hauls out a bundle of rope which he spins in a lasso over his head like a cowboy. <br />
                                    <br /> "The best toys I have complement the skills I already possess, and give me brand-new techniques I'm excited to practice and master!" Explains Hien with pride, twirling his lasso expertly. <br />
                                    <br /> "They bridge the space between us and open up new sensory experiences for me and the people I am intimate with." Agree Ziggy as the vibrator his is holding is lassoed by Hien's rope. <br />
                                    <br /> Across a montage of sex toys, both Hien and Ziggy's intermingling texts read, "When I look at my arsenal, I don't feel shame. I feel warmth. I feel excitement. I feel pride."<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh joy!" Exclaims Hien, yoinking Ziggy and his lassoed vibrator across the divide of their chat windows and into a shared reality where they lean against each other. <br />
                                    <br /> "Indeed!" Ziggy concludes with a wink. <br /> Transcribed by Erika Moen, November 11, 2024<br />

Today he reviews the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2089999&amp;u=772499&amp;m=128101&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tenga </a>Geo, 3D, and <strong>Spinner</strong>. </p>
                        <p>The process to find the right sex toy for you and your body can be can be so gosh darned disheartening, but ever so worth it when you eventually find the one that just <em>clicks</em>. Watching Hien go through the process and journal his findings in such delightful ways is truly a delight! I love that he’s also fallen for some of Tenga’s toys in the same way <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/spinner/">as I did</a> ;D Thank you so much, Hien, for your continued excitement, honesty, and talent!<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Hien Pham draws in a cartoon-y realistic style with the full spectrum of colors. He switches to a purely simplified cartoon chibi style to emphasize certain moments. <br /> Hien is a balding bearded Asian man wearing glasses, a white lab coat (with no shirt), and maroon shorts. <br /> A white middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair, Goldicock has neat facial hair, his penis is smaller than average with tight foreskin (phimosis) and wears no clothing at all. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 1<br /> "Oh!!! Woe is me!!!" Swoons Goldicock before a backdrop of magenta roses. "Burning is my desire to explore sleeves for masturbation! Yet, I fear I have too many requirements!" Now transforming into an anthropomorphic penis with its foreskin pulled nearly all the way up to the tip, leaving only the hint of the glans poking through, he continues, "My foreskin doth hurt when pulled back too far... which only exposes an even more delicate head that shan't be touched... Phimosis, this condition be called!" Behind him thorny roots criss-cross over a purple backdrop. Fully human once again, he cries into his hands, "How I evy others' perfect fittings! Will this Goldicock ever find something feels just right?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Don't fret, my worried friend." Hien says with compassion as he enters the scene. "We're not so different, you and I!" Now chibi-fied, Hien and Goldicock are joined by two more naked heavyset, hairy guys and an array of larger-than-life geometric, futuristic, artistic-looking masturbation toys. "Thanks to our gracious friends at Tenga, I have an entire arsenal of sleeves we can play with! Goldicock, let us bears help you find your perfect fit!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> The Model G is the first of the newcomers to speak up. He is a fat bearded ginger man without a moustache but a mop of softly wavy hair on top. His warm skin tone cannot hide the rosy blush on his cheeks he gets from talking passionately about his favorite topic. He is fully chibi-ed as he announces, "Let's try my favourite supple strokers!"<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Tenga GEO (Zen)<br /> Caption: $35 USD from Tenga. Retail prices may vary. <br />
                                    <br /> The GEO is the size and shape of a tennis ball, with a spiraling frill unwinding over the surface. It is flipped inside out through the entrance hole, so that the frill fills in the interior, leaving the exterior a smooth globe. <br />
                                    <br /> Transforming into a bearded, anthropomorphic cock, we see Model G through an x-ray view inside the GEO, which is pulling downwards over him. His foreskin is full retracted, revealing his flushed glans. He looks thoroughly overwhelmed, somewhere between pleasure and OVERSTIMULATION as he informs us, "The GEOs' direct head pressure and stimulation glide so tantalizingly across my glans for a sensation most akin to in-and-out penetration!" <br />
                                    <br /> As the GEO pulls upwards, we find Penis Goldicock inside the GEO with his foreskin tugged back up and over most of his glans and it is quite clear that he is in distress as he calls out, "Yowch! I fear this does not work for me! My sensitive head is painful to the touch, alas!"<br />
                                    <br /> Ready for his turn, the chibi-fied Model D steps up confidently to suggest, "Why don't you give my pick a shot!" He is a blond brown-skinned man with a dark goatee. <br />
                                    <br /> Title: Tenga 3D (Module)<br /> Caption: $35 USD from Tenga. Retail prices may vary. <br />
                                    <br /> The 3D is a tube shape covered in soft square tiles that jut out at varying depths, kind of resembling a cubic corn on the cob. When turned inside out the tiles squish together on the interior, while the exterior resembles a length of plumbing pipe, complete with thick silicone washers at either end. <br />
                                    <br /> Now in penis form, the Model D plunges headfirst inside the tube, where the silicone squares squish against his full exposed head and shaft. "These babies hug my shaft so nice and tight! I can feel the textures tug with each up-and-down!" <br />
                                    <br /> Penis Goldicock takes his turn inside the 3D, his foreskin tight up over his glans as he wails in pain, "I'm afraid this won't do either! The walls close too far in! My skin is slowly torn asunder!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Human once again, Goldicock curls on the ground in pain, holding his poor, abused bits as he laments, "Oh dear, I am battered and bruised... I don't know if I can go on..." <br />
                                    <br /> "Hang in there, Goldie!" Hien pats him reassuringly. "Take a breather! I do have one more sleeve I think you'll take a liking to!"<br />
                                    <br /> From Goldie's POV, we watch as he slides a transparent tube lined with teal twisting stripes mid-way down his shaft. "Oh... not too tight... good headroom for my size..." Hi anthropomorphized cock head looks surprised and delighted as it approaches the end of the semi-transparent masturbation sleeve, which is lined with geometric patterns and the teal coil wrapping around it. "Woah! how gentle it pulls! Gosh! Could this be?" The translucent material presses snugly against his head and shaft, with criss-crossing rings encircling it. <br />
                                    <br /> "IT'S THE PERFECT FIT!" Exclaims Goldie, leaping into the air (still sporting the sleeve on his dick) with Hien in celebration. Behind them we see the larger-than-life Tenga SPINNER (Pixel) masturbation sleeve. It is a rounded cylinder with a transparent exterior layer with a zig-zagging teal coil wrapping around it. There is an inner transparent layer with rows of Lego brick-shaped silicone spiraling opposite of the teal ones. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: $23 USD from Tenga. Retail prices may vary. <br />
                                    <br /> As Goldicock swirls the sleeve up and down his dick, he explains, "The built-in coil makes for a comfortable grip that squeezes and twists my member with every stroke! Combined with a suitably slippery lube, the brustles tug at the skin just right for a light yet tingly sensation!" <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Returned to their normal sizes and illustration style, Goldiclock clasps Hien's hands as he exclaims, "Thank you, Hien! For your research!"<br />
                                    <br /> "You bet!" Hien responds, hopping up and down with Goldie. Now turning to us, he continues, "It wasn't easy, and at times I felt so disheartened that everyone seems to have so many options, yet so few actually worked for me at all. Were there any made with me in mind? Was there any point in looking?" <br />
                                    <br /> We see Hien's foot, toes clenched in effort and his shorts dropped by his ankles. The narration tells us, "Thing is, I was used to jerking off all the time. So used to it that it became a chore I did on complete autopilot. Often, I would just rush myself toward the finish line just to get rid of the urges so I could continue with my day." <br /> "Come on! Hurry up!" Hien admonishes himself. <br />
                                    <br /> Now Hien is shown holding various masturbation sleeves in his hands, looking at them in shock and delight. He is in some kind of cave composed of thousands of cock sleeves. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: When I landed on a couple sleeves that worked for me, it was like I found joy in masturbation again! The act felt celebratory. It felt intentional again. I even found myself deliberately slowing down to take in the new sensations with each and every single stroke!"<br />
                                    <br /> Against the swirling cosmos, Hien floats with his body's outline filled with pulsating pink and yellow light, culminating in a glowing yellow heart over his groin area. A teal ribbon coils around him in space. He looks at peace. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The sleeves reinvigorated a masturbatory enthusiasm in me! <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Narration: Plus, the sleeves that didn't work for me worked wonders on many of my intimate friends!<br />
                                    <br /> Model G reappears in the more realistically drawn style. He reclines as he is jerked off with the GEO, clearly to the point of an inevitable orgasm. <br />
                                    <br /> The narration reads, "There's a visceral eroticism in watching a sexual partner's boner harden inside a semi-translucent Spinner." next to an illustration of exactly that. <br />
                                    <br /> Model D returns, also in the realistic style, playfully shaking out a cramp in his right hand while he holds the Tenga 3D in his left. <br /> Narration: And boy, are my injured artist arms happy to have the GEO's and 3D's help in a long edging session! <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I especially love the added warm domesticity when we shower and clean the toys together. Each time we talk about our preferred pleasure, we grow just a little closer.<br />
                                    <br /> Goldicock and the two models playfully, lovingly dry off their toys, everyone squeeky clean from a nice hot shower. <br />
                                    <br /> The chibi-fied versions of Hien and all the boys clamber over enormous models of the GEO, 3D, and SPINNER as Hien tells us, "All of this is to say: I just really enjoy strokers! My thanks to the folks at Tenga for championing this particular branch of self-love! And hey! Shout out to my fellow Goldicocks! The journey to define and reignite our own pleasure is not easy, but it is definitely one worth taking!"<br /> Transcribed November 4, 2024 by Erika Moen<br />

                                    <br /> Xb'rax is a humanoid creature with a white exoskeleton and an alien/insectoid kind of head. They have formations on their faceplate that rise up in a kind of fan/crown formation over their forehead, and two enormous pupil-less purple eyes on either side of their face. They have the basis of skeletal wing supports jutting out on either side, but there is no actual wing membrane attached. They are nightmarishly handsome. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hello, humans!" Xb'rax greets us cheerfully against a background of writhing eyes, tentacles, and fang-y mouths. "Do you like sex? I'm Xb/rax with the Abyssal Plane Tourism Board, and I'm here to ask why not try..."<br />
                                    <br /> Tile written in oozing pink cursive letters: Sex With Monsters? <br />
                                    <br /> "Ah," They continue. "so I've piqued your interest. Let's get into it! You can find creatures all around you!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: 1. Finding Monsters<br />
                                    <br /> Xb'rax's disembodied voice floats over a dark forest with black trees that look at us with their discreet eyeballs and coiling lime green fox in the background, announcing, "Spooky woods!" <br />
                                    <br /> A lime green coiling mass of energy snakes explode through a brick alleyway as Xb'rax narrates, "Extraplanar rifts!"<br />
                                    <br /> A purple hand with a silver thumb ring holds up their iPhone, which displays a program named "monstr" and shows a grid of creature-y profile pictures. "Dating apps!" Explains Xb'rax's voice. <br />
                                    <br /> Our narrator joins a line-up of wildly different monsters and creatures that stretches the width of the page as they continue, "Just remember... not all monsters like huymans or want to be an 'experiment.' Get comfy hearing the word 'no'!" Some creatures are humanoid, others are beastial, and some defy description. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Xb'rax's voice narrates, "You may not be able to tell a monster's age. Don't be afraid to ask for ID! 18+ only!" <br />
                                    <br /> A human stands with her hand out expectantly, asking a floating flaming skull, "ID?" Looking at the card, she reads "DOB: 14 billion years ago" and gives the skull a thumbs up. The skull's eye sockets squinch up, implying that they are smiling even though they have no lower jaw. <br />
                                    <br /> "Summoning a possible date?" Asks Xb'rax as they lean over a human-looking person who diligently writing away on the many scattered papers surrounding them, illuminated by a single candle. "Think about consent while writing spells. You can always cast another after you negotiate!" <br />
                                    <br /> A close-up reveals one line on a parchment that reads, "I'll be ur human fucktoy forever~ uwu"<br />
                                    <br /> "When in doubt, consult a pro summoner!" Xb'rax suggests, while gesturing to a hooded figure who waves at us. A hint of magic sparkles by their obscured face and their ceremonial glowing necklace is quite eye-catching. The summoner is labeled "4.8 on Yelp!"<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: 2. Communication and Negotiation<br />
                                    <br /> We are taken to a scene of stalagmite undersea coral-like formations that are topped with long swaying fronds and covered in spying eyes. In the foreground is a human looking bewitched and delighted, drooling just a little as they grin from ear to ear and their cheeks flush. A giant brain-like creature rests atop their head with their tentacles holding on to the sides of the human's head.<br />
                                    <br /> "Not all beings can speak or sign a human language." The voice of Xb'rax tells us. "Consent requires some form of communication..." <br />
                                    <br /> "I really like spanking." A voice says, which is emanating from both the brain-creature and human. <br />
                                    <br /> Xb'rax continues, "...so you may need to get creative!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> "Talk about the things you like!" Encourages the narrator. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'd like to be totally restrained and unable to move." Shares a human who looks us squarely in the eyes and holds a bundle of Shibari rope in her left <br /> hand. They wear a sports bra, have an assortment of tattoos, one of which covers the stump at the end of her right arm, and a small cloud of tightly curly black hair.<br />
                                    <br /> "I'd like to be totally restrained and unable to move." She announces.<br />
                                    <br /> "I've always wanted to roleplay as a human housewife." a moss-cocovered kind of dragon-worm with a ring of eyes running along the width of its head tells us. <br />
                                    <br /> "Go over all the boundaries and nos!" Xb'rax's voice urges next to the head of a kind of crustacean-alien-bug person that has many craggy segmented plates lining its face and an assortment of claw/horns. <br />
                                    <br /> "If sunlight touches this mortal form, I'll demanifest," Explains the creature to us. "so let's keep the shades drawn."<br />
                                    <br /> A topless human smiles at us as they hold a vibrating double-pronged sex toy and tells us, "Vaginal penetration is ok, but no anal." This person has shoulder-length choppy dark hair, a tattoo of a snake coiling around their right arm, and surgical scars under their flat pectoral muscles on their chest. Their vibrator goes, "bzzzz".<br />
                                    <br /> "Whew!" The narrator's voice exclaims. "You're ready to go! Let's get to the juicy stuff."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: 3. Safety During Play<br />
                                    <br /> A human clad only in boxers sits on a bed with their knees drawn up to their chest, smiling at the winged devil-humanoid who sits facing them. <br />
                                    <br /> "When I moult into my full form, stroke my wings to calm me down." The batwing-ed creature tells the human amiably. <br />
                                    <br /> "Use your words or other means of communication!" Urges the narrators voice as the human is now shown laying beneath the transformed incarnation of the previous creature, who is now a larger-than-life scaled dragon beast with a bat-like monster face, complete with multiple eyes and a gaping maw of fangs. <br />
                                    <br /> "A little too rough!" Pants the human as they massage the creature's wing membrane between thumb and forefinger. The expression of the person is scrunched up in both pleasure and pain, it is the face of endurance and someone recognizing their limits. <br />
                                    <br /> "No worries, bro." Responds the fearsome hell monster, droplets of their green sweat contrasting against the purple of the person's skin tone. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Rejoining us, Xb'rax announces, "Don't be afraid to change your mind even if you said 'yes' before!" while gesturing to the tentacle-y scene behind them. A human is suspended in the air by a mass of writing root-like appendages that presumably belong to the enormous multi-eyed creature face that learns at them from the foreground. <br />
                                    <br /> "I thought I'd like having all my holes stuffed..." The human informs the great beast. "...but please leave my ears alone." <br />
                                    <br /> In another scene, a different human asks, "Your roared when I rubbed your horns. Did you like that?" of the horny (literally, they have many horns) fork-tongued anthropomorphic creature gleefully lapping away at the person's cock. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ask questions, and be enthusiastic!" The narrator's voice encourages over the preceding scene and the next one. <br />
                                    <br /> A tubular, seaweed-y creature uses one of its various tube-y appendages to plumb the depths of a delighted and sweaty human's butt hole with a sound of "SHLUK SHLUK". "I love the way your ichor feels tingly on my balls." Shares the human between pants. "More of that, please!" The person's long curly hair mostly falls behind their shoulders, with two curling tendrils resting just above their full breasts while their hard cock flops against their belly, covered in fluids. <br />
                                    <br /> "Be creative and have fun!" Shares the narrator's voice over two more scenes of human/non-human sexual interaction. <br />
                                    <br /> In the first scene, a monstrously mutated wasp-like creature positions their ovipositor between the spread legs of a human who is bound up Shibari-style in a kind of web. The insects abdomen glows with hundreds of round green eggs that pulse against their casing, like a lumpy sac of potatoes. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'm gravid," Explains the creature to the delighted human. "but the eggs are infertile. If I lay them in you, your body will just absorb them."<br />
                                    <br /> "Do it!!" Gleefully urges the human, barely giving the hellish monstrosity time to finish their question. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'm so close..." Another human pants as they furiously fuck away at the surfboard-sized glowing crystal formation beneath them. "Can you loop time again when I come?"<br /> "You got it." Responds the beautiful rock, though they have no mouth from which to speak.<br />
                                    <br /> "That was fun. Now it's time to clean up." Concludes Xb'rax's narration. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Caption: Aftercare<br /> "Discuss aftercare needs before play, and leave time for them afterwards." The narration reads over two different scenes. <br />
                                    <br /> "I like to cuddle and be called 'good boy' after a rough topping." A topless human in a chest harness tells us. <br />
                                    <br /> A cone of lightning bolt surges informs us, "I will dematerialize after I come, so please use this amulet to resurrect me, and then I'd like some juice."<br />
                                    <br /> "Sometimes play can bring up big feelings! Leave room for them, too." Recounts Xb'rax's voice over the scene of an enormous bed, post-fucking. The blankets are rumbled, pillows are strewn about, and there's a variety of sexual aids sprinkled among the folds of fabric, in addition to one book with a pentagram and titled, "Sex Spells". A human lays on their side, entangled with the enormous demon that lays facing them, making the person appear to be quite small simply by comparison. The monster has enormous curling rams horns on their head, long features sprouting across their body and even more enormous, nightmarish feathered demon wings that rest against the terrain of their rumpled bed. <br />
                                    <br /> "Everyone always thinks of me as an EVIL demon king." The Demon King confesses to the human cuddled up in their burly, feathered arm. "It's nice to just pretend for once."<br />
                                    <br /> "There, there..." The human reassures their vulnerable partner with a look of peaceful contentment.<br />
                                    <br /> The narration concludes with, "Make sure everyone is good to go home." over the scene of a row of humans and creatures tucked in under the blankets next to each other as a wall of enormous eyeballs watches over them. <br />
                                    <br /> "I can still hear everyone's thoughts a little bit after that mind-meld." Announces one person sleepily with a tentacle coiling around a lock of their hair. "I need some more time before I'm good to drive."<br />
                                    <br /> Xb'rax rejoins us to finish with, "So that's that! You've got all the info you need to start exploring. Now, I gotta run! I've got a hot date at the spawning pool, but maybe I'll catch you there next time!"<br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> Ripley (who uses he/him pronouns), the author is a nonbinary person with glasses, shaggy black hair with a smattering of facial hairs. <br />
                                    <br /> Eivor (who uses any/they pronouns) is a short and chubby white person with buzzed hair and a tattoo on their right forearm. They're wearing a cropped t-shirt and shorts, and are Ripley's boyfriend. <br />
                                    <br /> The comic is drawn in a cartoon-y style with a palette of white, black, grays, and lime green.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 1<br /> Ripley and Eivor stand on a covered porch with plants growing from hanging baskets and a big bush growing at eye-level from the backyard. Ripley holds a condiment squeezey bottle in their hands. <br />
                                    <br /> "All done for the day?" Eivor asks. <br />
                                    <br /> "I think so." Replies Ripley, surveying the yard from their vantage point on the deck. "There's no saving the pumpkin patch, but the beans are going absolutely wild. I guess we could freeze a bunch for winter, and-" <br />
                                    <br /> Eivor leans in to give Ripley's shoulder-area a big ol' happy SNIIIIIIFF.<br />
                                    <br /> "..." Ripley looks at Eivor in stunned surprise. <br />
                                    <br /> "...Sorry!" Eivor blurts out, head still close to Ripley's shoulder. "Does that... bother you?" <br />
                                    <br /> "No, it's just..." Ripley looks away in embarrassment as they tug at their shirt collar. "I'm still getting used to it."<br />
                                    <br /> "That I like how you smell?" Asks Eivor, looking worried. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah. Especially that you seek me out when I'm grimy." He replies. <br />
                                    <br /> "I can't help it," Eivor says, throwing their arms around Ripley for a squeeze. "You just smell so good!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> "That's just it!" Reflects Ripley with anxiety at their memories. We see a much younger Ripley hunched over in their student chair, scribbling away at the notebook resting on the built-in desk-top. A faceless mob of students surrounds them, mocking them, and someone even chucks a bar of soap at their head. "I got bullied relentlessly as a kid for being 'stinky.' It can be hard to accept someone might enjoy how I smell."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The anxiety followed me for years, even after I cleaned up.<br />
                                    <br /> Still flashing back in their memories, a slightly older Ripley is canoodling with a shaggy-haired suitor who flirtatiously shares something with Ripley that we cannot hear. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: If anyone even suggested I had a smell...<br />
                                    <br /> Flashback Ripley is lost in a fog, looking blank and emotionally closed off as hand (presumably the companion from the last image) rests on their shoulder, trying to gently deter Ripley from leaving. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: ...I'd just shut down entirely. It made relationships difficult. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'm so sorry." Eivor's words cut through Ripley's memory. "I'd have never known. What changed?"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Back on the porch, Ripley and Eivor sit in the hodgepodge lounge on the deck that consists of a wonky wooden table and mismatched easy chairs. <br />
                                    <br /> "turning thirty helped, I think." Explains Ripley. "Something about the big three-oh made me care less about what other people thought about me. Everybody has a smell, it's normal. But what's interesting is my smell changed on HRT. I smelled different."<br />
                                    <br /> In a new flashback, an early-in-transition Ripley walks down a street with a scrolling scent fog accompanying them.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It was new and exciting.<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley takes a subtle sniff of their collar while walking. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And I dunno... <br />
                                    <br /> With little hearts emanating from them, Ripley stands up straighter with pride and a goofy smile as they continue their walk. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: ...Kind of sexy. <br />
                                    <br /> "So you agree." Eivor's comment cuts in once again to Ripley's memory. <br />
                                    <br /> "What?" Asks Ripley, now back in the present with Eivor on the deck.<br />
                                    <br /> "You think you smell good." Eivor says with a teasing grin, pointing a faux-accusatory finger at Ripley. <br />
                                    <br /> "...Yeah." Ripley concedes with a little surprise. "I guess I do."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Narration: Before the testosterone, however, there was long-distance backpacking.<br />
                                    <br /> We now join Ripley alone in the mountainous wilderness, just him, his backpack, his walking sticks, and elegant, rolling plumes of his scent wafting off of him.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: My body is the only thing that carries me across rivers and over mountains... how could I hate the byproduct of such badassery? My smell infuses everything I carry. Permeating not just my clothes, but everything that keeps me happy, healthy and safe. My odor became something to earn by surviving another adventure. Something to celebrate."<br />
                                    <br /> Back on the porch, Eivor chimes in affectionately, "Something for me to celebrate when you get home, too."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> "And it means so much that something inherent about me- something I used to hate- makes you so happy." Replies Ripley, looking touched. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's like the purest form of 'just be yourself!'" Laughs Eivor, who then falls into their own kind of fantasy as they visualize beautifully curling scent wafts, soap bubbles floating and bursting, and lots of little stars and hearts. "Like little bubbles of happiness popping into warm embers from my nose to my brain. It makes my gay little heart swell up with love and puppies."<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley looks a little insecure as they ask, "Even if I miss a T-dose and my 'old' smell fades in?"<br />
                                    <br /> "It's still you, isn't it?" Asks Eivor. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's the most me I can be." Ripley says, standing and leaning in to kiss Eivor's forehead. "...But I still need a shower."<br />
                                    <br /> "Leave me your shirt? Pleeeeease?" Playfully begs Eivor. <br />
                                    <br /> "Haha!" Ripley laugh, halfway through pulling off their shirt right there on the porch for a gleeful Eivor who reaches out to retrieve his shirt. "Sure, perv."<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> Senna Church is a white cis woman of average height, medium build and a round face. She has long wavy blonde hair tied back in a loose ponytail and a pair of large square glasses frames. She has a small beard on her chin with a light mustache to match.<br />
                                    <br /> The comic is drawn with a bright, clean, open, cartoony style. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hey there!" Senna greets us as she leans into the frame while wearing a medical mask over the bottom half of her face. "Nice to meetcha!"<br />
                                    <br /> "I think the first thing people notice about me is my beard." reads the narration as she pulls away the mask to show off her petite red curly fluff on her chin. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'm a cis woman, my facial hair is due to a condition called HIRSUTISM." She continues in a friendly manner. "Hirsutism is a response to an increase of androgens (male hormones) in the system that results in excessive hair growth." <br />
                                    <br /> Various little anthropomorphic hormones march in a row, following a sign reading "Bloodstream" as the narration explains, "Though its most often identified as a side effect of Ploycystic Ovary Syndrome and its abnormal hormonal production, Hirsutism may very well exist without it!" <br />
                                    <br /> A diagram displays a person with breasts a hairy chest, beard, sideburns, mustache, hairy arms, significant tummy/public hair, and leg hair, with the caption, "Notable hair growth can effect:"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Narration: When you look into hirsutism, you'll notice that most sources focus on "treatment" which is simply different forms of hair removal. <br />
                                    <br /> Senna is seen at her laptop, getting excited to find a "Hirsutism forum" in one panel and then looking away in frustrated resignation in the next as the forum goes on discuss "Best razors???"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It's no secret that people, especially feminine-presenting folks, are incentivized to be as hairless as possible.<br />
                                    <br /> Surrounded by posters advertising various hair-removal products and voluptuous, smooth women, Senna looks at them in confusion and overwhelm. <br />
                                    <br /> "A razor will take care of that." Says a chorus of voices from off screen to an annoyed-looking Senna. "Hair removal cream might work. Waxing is the only way to get it all off! You could bleach it!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: My problems started around middle school.<br />
                                    <br /> A younger Senna sits with a book. She sports only a handful of scraggly hairs on her face and wears a bulky gray hoody. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Narration: Some girl in my class said my moustache made me look like a boy. It was not a compliment. <br />
                                    <br /> In the foreground a girl snickers as she gestures at Senna, while Senna shrinks in embarrassment behind her book in the background. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Through middle and high school, I fumbled with cheap razors and scissors.<br />
                                    <br /> Through the reflection in her bathroom mirror, we see a wincing Senna wrangling an electric razor. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: My endocrinologist couldn't seem to come up with any tangible solutions at the time. <br />
                                    <br /> "Well, it's not an immediate health hazard, so if you want it gone, try laser hair removal?" The doctor suggests to teenage Senna. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The price was not the only painful part of the treatment." <br />
                                    <br /> Laying on her back on a medical bed, Senna has intense wraparound sunglasses on over her eyes while a technician uses a device to painfully zap away at her chin.<br />
                                    <br /> Senna lets out a whimper as a tear rolls out from under her sunglasses and slides down her cheek. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ok, let's stop for now." Declares the tech. <br />
                                    <br /> Senna slouches, looking dejected in her graduation cap and gown. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: By the time I graduated, I was too burnt out with my self image to keep shaving. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> In a mostly gray-blue panel, Senna meets somebody as she carries a box of her belongings into her college dorm. Her facial hair is scraggly and sparse.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: In college I met other people with unique ways they present themselves. I finally started to feel comfortable about my own body because I was no longer an anomaly.<br /> Now the color palette has shifted to welcoming purples and pinks as Senna stands in a sea of people with very diverse hair styles, facial hair, and piercings. Her own facial hair has grown to a cute chin tuft with hints of a moustache coming in.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: My confidence started to come back to me. My facial hair wasn't a burden, but a part of my identity. <br />
                                    <br /> With the same warm purple background, Senna now smiles admiringly at her little mustache and chin beard tied with a decorative band. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I stopped trying to regularly shave my hair, I even started to style it. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> A bathroom wastebasket holds a discarded razor and electric buzzer, with the cord trailing onto the ground. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It took so much effort to finally learn to love myself. It's really not easy, I still struggle with it. <br />
                                    <br /> A small cluster of hair care products and tools accompanies the narration, "But I know I' on a good path because I'm learning to take care of myself."<br />
                                    <br /> Fully nude but positioned so we can't see any of the private parts, Senna shows off her hairy legs, full armpits, hairy arms, chin beard and moustache as she concludes with a wink, "Hair isn't for everyone, but I'm learning to embrace the fuzz!"<br />
                                    <br />

I always get so nervous that we’ll look like a sold out shill, but truly, these wands show up in our comic’s (and artists bedrooms) again and again for a reason, and it’s nothing to do with Magic Wand supporting the site! </p>

                                    <br /> Image: A sleek, curved lightly-phallic vibrator in white and teal. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It does the job well enough. <br />
                                    <br /> In bed, Stefanie's face is illuminated by her phone while her other hand is buried deep under the blankets. She impishly smiles with excitement.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Never had any issues with it, and it was a good investment. <br />
                                    <br /> A flutter of pink hearts erupts from under the covers as Stefanie squeezes her eyes shut in contained pleasure and their cheeks flush. Contentedly, they snuggle down under the covers, ready for sleep. But then her eyes snap open with inspiration. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But I could do better. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Narration: I've had a few other toys before and they were fine, but none of them were quite "The One."<br />
                                    <br /> A trio of labeled teal toys is lined up.<br />
                                    <br /> Title: ???<br /> Description: A kind of pickle-shaped phallus with warty buttons along one end. <br /> Commentary: Ehhh...<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Rabbit Vibe<br /> Description: A penis-shaped dildo that has a bulb at its base filled with small balls that rotate around. A bunny-like shape arches over the bulb, pointing towards the dildo head. Beneath this is a shaft to hold.<br /> Commentary: Fun, but too loud (and broken).<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Lelo Gigi<br /> Description: The vibrator from the previous page, a sleekly curved phallus with a subtle head at the top.<br /> Commentary: Current fave.<br />
                                    <br /> Stefanie studies her monitor, deep in thought. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: After a bit of research, it was down to two. They were both a bit pricey, and I could afford one or the other. <br />
                                    <br /> With a decisive CLIK-A-CLIK on her hot pink computer mouse, the narration declares, "But I kind of knew what I wanted before I bought it." <br />
                                    <br /> Stefanie opens their front door to reveal a rectangular box, and she holds her hands up in surprise delighted.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And a few days later..."<br />
                                    <br /> They gaze in wonder at the opened box in her hands. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It came. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Title: Hitachi Magic Wand ($139.95)<br />
                                    <br /> Stefanie marvels with stars in their eyes at the giant, sleek vibrator floating before her. It has a a semi-circle head that rest on top of a nub of a neck which connects to the long, elegant body that is about the length of a forearm. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: An oldie but a goodie, with most reviews being overwhelmingly positive. And it's rechargeable!<br />
                                    <br /> She bolts down the hall with the Wand in hand. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I had to try it immediately. <br />
                                    <br /> Stefanie leaps onto their bed, landing on her butt and still wearing a tank top with briefs. With a giant goofy smile of anticipation, they turn on the wand and watch as that big round head rumbles with vibrations. Now laying on her back, they position the wand between their legs...<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Little pink hearts begin flutter up from where the wand head is pressed between Stefanie's legs, over the fabric of her briefs. Their expression transforms from seductive to flushed to finally joyfully shocked as a giant orgasm rolls through her body, causing her to buck on her back and hold on for dear life to the comforter on their bed. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> "H-holy shit..." Stefanie eventually manages to say as they lay on their back, utterly stunned. She loosely holds the inactive Wand over their stomach as they wait for their flush to settle down. <br />
                                    <br /> After a moment, they hold the wand up to take a good look at it. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: "Magic Wand..." Pretty dang accurate. Ten out of ten. Will orgasm again.<br />
                                    <br /> With a fresh flock of hearts erupting from their lower region off camera, Stefanie flushes again in pleasure with their arm clearly holding the wand in action again, though we cannot see it ourselves. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And again... And again... And again...<br />

Asymmetry is a natural and common part of most bodies, yet it’s rarely talked about.

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> A big, beautiful page of soft purples and blues with illustrations and comic panels cascading downwards in a really organic way. Robogart is a fat (size 18-20), femme-leaning person (she/they), with long dark hair and round glasses. They begin with bangs and straight hair just barely past her shoulders.<br />
                                    <br /> The top half of the page is toned in all purple hues. Robogart stands before us nude, with her hands clasped over their heart. A large phantom circle floats over where her right breast would be, labeled D. Over the left breast is a smaller phantom circle labeled C. Behind her are two giant figures with uneven breasts and stretch marks leading to them. "I've always had asymmetrical breasts." Robogart shares demurely, eyes closed and standing between the giant background figures. "But as I've gained more weight over time, they became more noticeable. Almost a whole cup size of difference at this point. I've already felt so strange in my body. Too fat to be queer." <br />
                                    <br /> The page transitions into blue tones, with a cascade of askew, tall vertical panels of idealized bodies. A purple Robogart sits on the ground with her back to us, and facing the idealized blue bodies. They continue, "Not the right hourglass fat to be feminine. Too rounded and soft to be masculine. Not thin enough to be inbetween. I thought, 'If only I was thinner, maybe my body would look more even, more desirable. More beautiful. More handsome.' "<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Now wearing a long, simple dress and shoes, a purple Robogart evaluates her reflection in an askew, vertical mirror that is reminiscent of the panels on the previous page. Her hair has shortened to just below their chin. They look contentedly amused at what they see in the mirror, resting her hand on their stomach. The background is shades of blue, contrasting against her purple tones.<br />
                                    <br /> By her standing figure, the narration reads, "I tried binders, for a time. Wishing my breasts were gone." In the mirror, the narration continues "a little flatter" over her chest, and then a close up rounded panel shows us their chest pushed down by a binder as the narration concludes, "That I could be more androgynous without them."<br />
                                    <br /> As we look down the page, we see that the foot of the standing Robogert from the previous illustration is actually standing over her face in a new askew square-ish panel. While everything else in the panel is purple, there is a pale blue splatch shape over the bottom half of their (distressed-looking) face and over their neck and upper chest, leading onto their cleavage that is exposed in their t-shirt. The text "SUPERCLEAVAGE" in bubble letters floats over their breast area. <br />
                                    <br /> In the next askew, square-ish blue panel, Robogert adjusts one breast under her shirt, looking upset and sad. There is a pinkish-purple splatchy shape over their shoulder-chest area, hands, and on their glasses. <br />
                                    <br /> "But because my breasts are two different sizes, I could never get a comfortable fit, and they would shift really quickly." Reads the narration under the previous panel. <br />
                                    <br /> The SUPERCLEAVAGE text and panel obscures the her face in a third askew, square-ish purple panel. Their hair is a dark green-purple and she has purple stretch marks on her chest, leading to their breasts. Outside the panel, a deep blue (almost black) binder (like a sports bra) floats against the page. The narration cuts across these two images, reading "Honestly it make me feel worse. More wrong."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> "I felt alone." Against a dark purple, blobby background, a bluey-purple Robogert says while looking at their laptop sadly. "I felt like anyone I talked to didn't experience this at all. So I took to the internet to search for what's wrong with my body."<br />
                                    <br /> "WOW!" They exclaim as they find purple forums and photos of uneven breasts. Their hair is long enough to brush her shoulders.<br />
                                    <br /> "And lo and behold, it turns out that so many people experience breast asymmetry!" The narration declares over these images. <br />
                                    <br /> "TOTALLY NORMAL!!" Announces a peach and purple chat window, while another purple one adds, "Just not talked about enough."<br />
                                    <br /> The background shifts to purple abstract shapes and Robogert, too, takes on a purple-blue-peachy hue. In relief and gratitude, they close their eyes with a tear and hold their hands together, close to her face, reminiscent of a prayer. <br />
                                    <br /> "Forums of people sharing their experiences and offering affirmations and reassurances abound!" Exalts the narration. "Everyone looked so beautiful! God, I felt so much less alone."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> The page background behinds with pink and peachy abstract shapes, transitioning downwards to yellows, violet, and finally lands on green. <br />
                                    <br /> "I draw fat characters look like me, fat and hairy, who present as men, women both or neither." Robogert tells us while drawing away at their laptop. They are hued in pinky-purples and their hair falls just past her shoulders. "And it's empowering!"<br />
                                    <br /> A rainbow of Robogerts fans across the width of the page, each one in a different color and fashion. Different pieces of colored clothing float in the background. <br />
                                    <br /> "I feel beautiful and seen, and to share this expression and feeling through my art means even more." The green Robogert tells us confidently with a wink, positing to show off their crop top, shorts, hairy legs, and sneakers. "I wear looser bras and tight shirts and I don't care so much these days."<br />
                                    <br /> A pinky-purple Robogert exclaims in joy, "I feel both feminine and masculine, neither and both, and it's been wonderful!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Back to a dark blue-teal background, a small blue Robogert with shoulder-length hair says in shame, "There are some days where loving my body is still a little hard."<br />
                                    <br /> The foreground fills up with a very content and naturally-colored Robogert sharing, "But those days are fewer with each passing year. And seeing just how common and normal asymmetrical breasts are has really played a huge role in accepting and loving my body." She has long brown hair past their shoulders now, peachy skin, and a light purple shirt. <br />
                                    <br /> Now in a yellow crop-top and with their hairy legs on display, she continues joyfully, "Bodies are varied, remarkable and beautiful! And having a body that is asymmetrical is normal! Being fat and asymmetrical does not detract from you gender and expression." Behind them floats an assortment of color-toned photos of different people showing off their varied body types and outfits. "Your fatness and asymmetry are a part of your beauty! Know that you are not alone and that your body has been and always will be beautiful in all of its shapes!"<br />

Smaller, sleeker, and still packed with all the power that has earned it&amp;#8217;s reputation.And heck, don&amp;#8217;t forget to let Ripley [&amp;#8230;]</summary>

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> The color palette of this comic is dusty, with dark maroons, pinks, pale yellows, white and black. It's got a noisy gritty layer treatment, lending itself to a vintage feeling. <br />
                                    <br /> The characters in todays comic are the following: <br />
                                    <br /> - Ripley, the author is a nonbinary person with glasses, shaggy black hair, a a chain around their neck, a white lab coat with yellow latex gloves, and yellow goggles on their forehead. <br /> - Franci, a cis black woman (she/her), who is reappearing from Ripley's previous comic about periods in the wilderness. She also wears a white lab coat and yellow goggles, but her gloves are dark purple and go all the way up to her elbows. Her curly hair is pulled back in a braid, with a poof of bangs over her forehead. <br />
                                    <br /> "At last!" Franci exclaims, gesturing to an enormous scientific machine that towers over her. "The day has come to test my latest invention! This shrink ray will revolutionize the world in making all thins FUN-SIZED!" <br />
                                    <br /> Now pointing dramatically to Ripley, she orders "Active the Shrinkinator!"<br />
                                    <br /> "You got it!" Says Ripley, yanking down a giant switch with both their hands, creating a loud CLUNK! sound. The sign over it warns "DANGER!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yes! Yes! BWAHAHHA-HA-HA!" Crows Franci as a bolt of electrified light zaps out of a staff with multiple disks and a bulb at its tip. Clipboard in hand, Ripley adjusts their goggles, smiling in approval at the scene unfolding before them. <br />
                                    <br /> "Success!" Franci exclaims, holding a pocket-sized vibrator aloft. It has a short handle and a tiny little neck that connects to a rounded ball-shape at the top. "A Magic Wand vibrator at 1/4th size!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Ooh..." Ripley coos in wonder. <br />
                                    <br /> Franci rips open her lab coat, exposing her dark purple bra underneath. "Testing time!!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yes! My favorite part!" Concurs Ripley as they click their pen in one hand and ready their clipboard in the other. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> "Greetings, perverts!" A tiny Ripley welcomes us while standing next to a giant Micro Magic Wand, which a helpful note clarifies is "Not to scale". They are taking notes on their clipboard as they continue to talk to us. "Today we're reviewing the Magic Wand Micro." <br />
                                    <br /> Around the vibrator, its stats are posted: 4.5" x 1.3", $64.99, soft silicone head, 3 speeds: 4,5000 RPM, 5,500 RPM, 6,500 RPM, USB-C Rechargeable (one fewer cable to lose!), 4 patterns: Beats, slow pulse, Fast pulse, wave. <br />
                                    <br /> "I like this 'Wave' pattern the most. It feels longer than similar patterns on other ibes and goes lower than the lowest steady setting." Ripley says, showing us a big heart they drew on their clipboard. <br />
                                    <br /> Now checking back further in their notes, Ripley continues, "After hours of dedicated research, we discovered that the Mico packs BIG power in a tiny package! The petite head is just the right size to nestle between your labia but large enough to disperse sensation over the entire clitoris!" In the background, Franci kicks up her legs as she puts the Micro to use. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Ripley gestures with discontent at a digram using a pointing wand. The diagram shows a vibrator pushing a clitoris to the side, leaving it exposed to the plain air. A helpful icon of a thumbs down illustrates that this is not ideal. "A big problem I have with most vibrators is that they tend to push my clitoris to one side or the other. While I can incorporate that into play, most of the time it's just... frustrating." <br />
                                    <br /> Now tapping their wand enthusiastically against a different diagram which shows the Micro's head fully shmooshing dead center between the model's labia, Ripley continues, "But the Micro's flat head is just squishy enough to prevent that kind of unwanted movement! I cannot overstate how awesome that is for me."<br />
                                    <br /> The page fills up with latex-gloved hands holding the Micros in a variety of different configurations while the narration reads, "Additionally, nothing kills the mood for me more than hand pain. Ergo, a toy's ergonomics are a high priority. I found the Micro comfortable almost any way I held it! Especially since it doesn't have a long, heavy handle to pull at my wrist. (Or to get caught in my sheets!)"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Narration: Something that stuck out to me, considering the price point, was the lack of waterproofing. <br />
                                    <br /> Now shrugging next to an enormous version of the Micro, Ripley adds "This might be a deal breaker for some, but not so much for me!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I actually find the Micro's split, open body design (which is what makes it susceptible to water) way better for my chronic hand pain. The vibes mostly stay up at the business end, away from my hands and that's pretty neat. So if waterproofing is important to you, you're gonna want to look elsewhere.<br />
                                    <br /> Still miniaturized, Ripley gestures to an oversize Micro, saying, "But, as much as I like this guy, there are a few things they could work on."<br />
                                    <br /> The narration points to the two round buttons on the body of the Micro, explaining, "These buttons could be WAY more tactile. They are TINY and impossible to find by touch along when it's vibrating."<br />
                                    <br /> To the side, Franci sits up in frustration, fumbling with her Micro. "Come on..." She grumbles at it. <br />
                                    <br /> The scene suddenly pitch black, Ripley and Franci are illuminated by a beam of light emanating from the Micro. <br />
                                    <br /> "And I don't know about ya'll, but most of my playtime takes place in dark or dim light. So having a lighthouse on my crotch isn't my idea of a good time!"<br />
                                    <br /> The narration explains, "A power indicator never needs to be this bright!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Whoa" marvels Franci. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Two bell jars are on display next to each other. Under the first one, labeled "fig.69b Bullet" we see the classic "egg" vibrator with a cord trailing off one end. The narration above it reads, "At this size I consider the Micro more a fancy bullet than a 'downsized wand.' But what it lacks in punch it makes up for in the classic Magic Wand RUMBLE." <br />
                                    <br /> The next bell jar is labeled "fig.69w WAND" and contains the classic 1970s style uber-sized Magic Wand with its mega-long handle, cord, and a rounded-but-indented head. The narration continues, "Like the difference between a cello and a violin, the Micro hits those deep notes without the sharpness I've come to expect from bullets." <br />
                                    <br /> Between the two bell jars, a Micro Magic Wand is proudly presented on its own pedestal, glowing and sparkling. <br />
                                    <br /> "But, uh, $65 is huge for a bullet." Ripley says skeptically, gesturing at their clipboard notes. "While this fun little guy meets a lot of my very specific needs there are probably cheaper options out there." <br />
                                    <br /> The notes on the clipboard read, "Comfortable to hold. Convenient to charge. Flat, squishy head. Deep vibrations that don't transfer." along with a checked box by each one. <br />
                                    <br /> Back the enormous Shrinkinator machine from the beginning of the comic, a fully nude Franci (except for gloves, goggles, and boots) stands expectantly before the device's business end, asking, "So was the experiment a succcess? Have we achieved fun-size?" <br />
                                    <br /> "I think we have!" Concurs Ripley, who holds their clipboard in one hand but now has a nice average-sized dark purple dildo in the other. "But what if next time we try... King size? I've got the perfect test subject..."<br />

                        </code>We’re comign up fast to some big changes for our Patreon! I went ahead and wrote about what to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/important-update-111027003" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expect over here</a>. BUT the TLDR: is that in the next few weeks OJST will officially be switched to a <strong>Per-Month Patreon Subscription</strong> =D No more fluctuating charges depending on how many Tuesdays there are in a specific month! Now, you’ll be able to commit a set amount of support and just sit back and relax. Granted we’re a bit rattled by the forced change, but we’re equally excited to make supporting us, our artists, and this site easier =D<p />
                        <p>Don’t let me talk you out of backing us now though: sign up for a buck or two <strong>right now</strong> to see the BTS and bonuses, while they are at their cheapest!</p>

                                    <br /> The art style is rendered in a rich, painterly, textured manner with a mostly brown, orange, yellow, tan, white, and black color palette over fairly realistic depictions of the people and objects.<br />
                                    <br /> A crumpled, black and red shirt is laid out and a black leather chest harness with silver metal bits resting on top of it. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh boy..." The narration begins over Hien Pham sitting shirtless and looking at his reflection in a vanity mirror with large white light bulbs lining its edge. "Here we go again..."<br />
                                    <br /> Hien rests his elbows on the edge of the dressing room table, on the plaid shirt and chest harness, as he continues to look pensively at his reflection. He is framed between a gap in the thick, purple privacy curtains as the narration continues, "Many things surprised me when I first came out onto the queer scene, but few were as boisterous and beautiful as *titleholder competitions.*"<br />
                                    <br /> Along the entire vertical length of the righthand side of the page, we see stripes of black, gray, white, tan, yellow, orange, and brown leather sewn together at a slight diagonal. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Set against a flat color background of those same diagonal colored stripes, we see Stewart Wheeler - Mr. Bear Perth 2023, a hunky, hairy white man flexing and smiling coyly at us. He wears a crown sewn out of the same diagonal colored leather strips, as well as a pageant sash with the same. He also sports a black leather brimmed cap underneath his crown, a leather cuff on his wrist, a black leather open vest, and a heavy-duty chain necklace. His thick reddish-brown beard and hairy chest and shoulders are proudly on display. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Mr. Bear, Ms. Leather, Mx. Rubber, National and International Pups and Handlers... These mini Prides are held annually, with handfuls of events leading up to big pageants where communities look for their next representative. The newly-sashed titleholder goes on to raise funds and awareness for their club and chosen charity, as well as to enrich the local queer culture for the rest of their title year. <br />
                                    <br /> Now outside a pub in the evening, with string lights illuminating the bustling terrace, Hien stands to the side nervously. He wears his black and red plaid flannel shirt. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I first put my hand up for Perth's Mr. Bear in 2021 as an incredibly earnest attempt at making friends and introducing myself to the community. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien sits quietly in a chair among several men jovially talking and drinking. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Despite not winning the sash, I've become a regular face, volunteer, and even a committee member over the last three years. <br />
                                    <br /> In the same outfit and now sporting a kind of cartoonish koala onesie that he wears as a hood on his head and the body flows down his back like a cape, Hien skittishly navigates a crowd of men, serving up a tray of snacks for the attendees. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The Bears have since become a place I don't hesitate to call home, but it hasn't always been a smooth ride. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Hien stands outside a well-lit building, leaning against a porch handrail. He is back to just his black and red flannel shirt, dark khaki shorts, and no koala hood this time. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Alongside the feel-giood, there were times I felt so acutely alone. I am a brown kid who's not as hairy, not as sexual, not as conventionally Bear-y as I and many would like... Am I even fit to represent this community?<br />
                                    <br /> Inside an empty pub on a later date, Hien now sits at a tall, round bar table with Mitchell Bertolini - Mr. Bear Perth 2020 and Mr. Australiasia Bear 2021. Mitch is a non-binary (he/they) Italian person with the sides of his head buzzed short and a mane of thick hair swept back from the center of his head, running down to their neck. They have a sparse, short beard with a thicker (but still short) mustache, a pierced ear, and he wears a soft hoody and jeans. Hien wears a short-sleeved button down shirt and shorts. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's a double-edged sword." Mitch tells Hien. "I won, and I'm making connections and engaging with a community that I could feel I was a part of... But it was also the start of a lot of bullying and ridicule. A lot of people didn't agree with my physical appearance and the way I presented my gender. 'He's not a Bear.' 'What a disgrace to Bears.' 'Twink with a moustache.' Nevermind that I was volunteering and donating not just my time, but also money from my small business."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> "What kept you coming back?" Hien asks. <br />
                                    <br /> "I genuinely, whole-heartedly, just want a space to be queer." Replies Mitch. "I met some of my closest friends through community events. I didn't have any queer friends up until then." Smiling fondly and resting his head against his hand, he continues, "The first time I came to Bears, Sam, who was the present and titleholder at the time, walked up to me and asked for my name. He got me to pull the raffle ticket that night. It was wild! I kept coming back because of it."<br />
                                    <br /> Hien's face lights up as Mitch tells him, "You've always been good at that, Hien, welcoming new people. Someone's initial interaction when they first walk through the doors can make or break their relationship with the scene. Girl, you were even introducing *my* friends that *I* brought to Bears to me!"<br />
                                    <br /> "I didn't know!!" Wails Hien in exaggerated embarrassment as he covers his head in mock-shame. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's funny! Keep doing your Hien thing!" Encourages Mitch with a laugh. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Back in the dressing room from the beginning of the story, Hien buttons up his black and plaid flannel shirt, rolls up his sleeves, and attaches his "Bears Perth: Hien" tag on his chest, next to one of his leather harness's straps. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Like Mitch, I found a home of Bears because someone saw me when I felt so invisible. I wouldn't have met so many irreplaceable friends in my life if I wasn't afforded that chance to be seen, and to belong. I'm competing against for a lot of reasons: to show that someone like me can be Bear Excellence, to challenge myself, to show my growth..." <br />
                                    <br /> Taking a calming breath, Hien stands behind a thick theater curtain which is cracked just enough to let a thin vertical beam of light shine onto his face and chest. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But, I think, at the core, it's to extend a welcoming hand to someone who needs that chance like I once did. It's achievable without a title, but this celebration is the perfect opportunity for one invisible kid to inspire many others." <br />
                                    <br /> From behind, we see Hien part the curtains and the warm stage lights illuminate his front, giving us just a rimming glow around his edges. The O-ring and straps of his harness are just barely visible to us. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I truly believe, the single greatest thing any of us can ever do, is to make an effort to show someone that they matter.<br />

                        </div>We’re a few weeks away from a big Patreon switcheroo update! I went ahead and wrote about what to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/important-update-111027003" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expect over here</a>. BUT the general jist is that next month OJST will officially be a <strong>Per-Month Patreon Subscription</strong> =D No more fluctuating charges depending on how many Tuesdays there are in a specific month- now, you’ll be able to commit a coffee or two and just sit back and relax. Granted we’re a bit rattled by the forced change, but we’re equally excited to make supporting us, our artists, and this site easier =D<p />
                        <p>Don’t let me talk you out of backing us now though: signing up for a buck or two <strong>right now</strong> to peek at our BTS and bonuses, it’s probably the cheapest it’ll ever be! Sign up cheap, take a peek, and stick around for the switcehroo if you fancy the idea. </p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Mads G draws with a very bouncy, cartoony style using primarily a color palette of pinks, purples, and dusty yellows. The sex toys themselves use an array of colors including orange, turquoise, purple, green, and lavender. <br />
                                    <br /> Our protagonist is dressed like a 1970s game show presenter with round glasses, a big handlebar mustache, a haircut resemble the glans of a penis (complete with a cowlick in place of an ejecting drop), a suit with oversize shoulder pads, a striped turtleneck, and a microphone in hand. <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE ONE<br /> They eagerly greet us by announcing, "Welcome back to the first annual Fun Factory Pulsator Pageant. I'm your host, Gustav Abspritzen and I'm BUSTING A NUT to be here! We have some amazing queens here tonight and our esteemed panel of judges have had ample time to compare..." <br />
                                    <br /> Abspritzen gestures to the panel of judges, which are anthropomorphic cartoons of a content vulva in a onesie with a giant bow under its chin ("Clit"), a worried-looking circle with a mouth puckered into an X and wearing a top hat ("Hole"), and a laidback wallet with some cards and cash sticking out of its folds ("Wallet"). All of the objects in this comic have expressive little faces. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Let's have a quick recap of our lovely contestants: <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The classic, the elegant, STRONIC REAL - A true original!<br /> Illustration: an orange phallus looking content with eyes closed. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Along with the queen of glitz and glamor, STRONIC G!<br /> Image: A pink phallus with a much more pronounced head. It smiles wide-mouthed. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The striking and sensual SURF - Just look at those curves! <br /> Image: A teal phallus with groovy ridges along its sides smiles with eyes closed, looking demure. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: MAKE WAY! MAKE WAY! Here comes the big, beautiful, bodacious BI FUSION!<br /> Image: A large purple phallus with a subtle bend to its shaft also has an extra appendage protruding from closer to its bottom end. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And finally, the tiny twins SUNDAZE and PETITE - Don't let their small size fool you!<br /> Image: Two much smaller phalluses bob happily. The blue one is also rippled like Surf while the green one has a large oval-like shape extending out of its head. <br />
                                    <br /> All of the toys have identical bottoms, a purple cap with two buttons. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE TWO<br /> Abspritzen continues as the phalluses dance and perform, some with props like a wand and cane. <br /> "We had a spectacular talent competition tonight, full of surprises! Real started us off with some classic moves without vibration! Kickin' it oldschool - too traditional for this crowd perhaps? G brought a little extra razzamatazz with their jaunty curve, giving Real a run for their money! Could they be outshined? Surf's interpretive dance really shook things up a bit! Building on the moves of Real and G, they added their own wiggly flair! Petite followed up with... uh... the exact same act but like... small? <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE THREE<br /> The toys continue to dance around as Abspritzen goes on, "Sundaze, with their postmodern look, kind of did their own thing. Some vibrations here, some thrusting there. Will the judges by impressed? Finishing us off, Bi Fusion floated like a butterfly but stung like a bee with their unique animal companion. Wide coverage with girth to match. Buzzy and rumbly, sure to please, I expect! Now let's hear from our well-traveled panel of discerning judges: What do you have to say about our competitors, Clit?"<br />
                                    <br /> Contemplatively, Clit answers while stroking their chin, "Well, I know I can come off a little intense and hard to please but I promise it's not personal! BI FUSION definitely has my vote here, you can't argue with those vibrations. Surf comes close behind, even if they might need some maneuvering. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE FOUR<br /> "Hole?" Abspritzen asks. "What's your take?"<br /> Sitting next to Clit, Hole thoughtfully strokes their chin as they reply, "I'm no spring chicken so I've seen many-a-toy in my time. Real and G of course are classics, old standbys - Sure, Petite and Sundaze come in handy, but they need a little more oomph. Sundaze was also a bit complicated to use in comparison..." Now definitively but sweating, they conclude, "Bi Fusion can be a tight squeeze and Surf's shape was intimidating but both really surprised me! I'm not usually one for novelty, but SURF has my vote in the end." <br />
                                    <br /> Bringing the microphone over to Wallet, Abspritzen asks, "And finally, Wallet, our most controversial judge. What do you have to say?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Let's be real," Wallet begins. "you're a quality bunch who cost a pretty penny. I gotta ask how you stack up to each other. Petites is definitely the cheapest date of the bunch, typical for a small size. Real, G, and Surf are all the same size and the same price but somehow Sundaze is up there with them. Yeah, they're a little funky with the extra vibrations and shape but they're a bit... confusing."<br /> "HEY!" Sundaze interjects from off screen. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE FIVE<br /> Taking this seriously, Wallet continues, "Bi Fusion, big gal, is the most lux of the bunch, which also makes total sense. You get what you pay for. All that being said, Surf is really the best bang for the buck so to speak - although Petite's copycat nature pays off here. <br />
                                    <br /> Abspritzen address the reader, with a silhouette line-up of the toys behind him. <br /> "We've given the judges some time to deliberate and the votes have now been tallied! A final thank you to all our fabulous Fun Factory contestants! Time to reveal our lucky winner..." In delight, Abspritzen announces, "SURF! You're officially the best banf for the buck and have won the grand prize of... BEING A CARTOONIST'S FAVORITE!"<br />
                                    <br /> with tears of joy, Surf accepts a bouquet of flowers and addresses the audience with, "I wanna thank my mom and my dad." while in the background flowers fall from the sky and the song "Here she isssss, Miss Pulsator Univerrrrse...." plays. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE SIX<br /> In a completely different setting, the cartoonist Mads G jolts upright in bed. "I just had a crazy dream..." He says to his sleeping companion, rubbing his eyes. "It was like some weird Miss America pageant thing but everybody was a dildo and the host's name was 'cum' in German and - " <br />
                                    <br /> "Huh?" His companion blearily sits up, revealing that they are, in fact, human-size Stronic Real toy. "What's Miss America?"<br />
                                    <br /> The page concludes with the sound effect of Mads screaming, "AAAAAAAAAH!" and a little note left in the bottom corner reading, "Thank you OJST and Fun Factory!"<br />

                            </code>Matt and I had a real moment when we realized that it had been 8 years since <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/vestibulodynia/">Alex first showed up on OJST.</a> That sort of decade long feeling, the ability to keep adding to these stories and touch base with artists even after so long… Well, it’s powerful and something we don’t take for granted. For the price of a coffee; you can help keep the space going, help us keep making these comics: and get bonus exclusive comic’s and BTS stuffs as a way of thanks!</p>

                                    <br /> The color palette of this comic is dusty, with dark maroons, pinks, pale yellows, white and black. It's got a noisy gritty layer treatment, lending itself to a vintage feeling. The characters in todays comic are the following: <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley, the author is a nonbinary person with glasses, shaggy black hair, a pink kerchief around their neck, black knee-length shorts, and a yellow long-sleeve shirt. They also have a smattering of facial hairs. Their friend is a pale-skinned cis woman with short curly pink hair and wears a purple tank top. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 1<br /> A car speeds along a winding road in a woodland wilderness, along a canyon with a river running in it and mountains in the background.<br />
                                    <br /> "So how many miles did you hike?" A voice asks from inside the car, to which another voice responds, "One-hundred and sixty-five! That brings my total to 1,725!"<br />
                                    <br /> Inside the car we now see that it is Ripley talking, as they continue, "Only 925 to go until I've hiked the entire Pacific Crest Trail!" Simultaneously proud and resting, Ripley cups the back of their head, which raises their elbows into the air. Notable fumes waft from their armpits. "how'd your week go?"<br />
                                    <br /> From the driver's seat, their friend replies, "Oh, y'know, kept your garden nice and watered... The cats were SO needy while you were gone. And-" As the scent fumes reach the friend's nose, they freeze in horror as they inhale with a mighty SNIFF. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley then starts as their window rolls down on its own accord and their voluminous stink plumes are sucked out the window.<br />
                                    <br /> "...Sorry." They offer sheepishly to their friend, who still has her hand on the window controls from the driver's side. <br />
                                    <br /> "No, it's okay! It just blows my mind that you can tolerate being so *filthy* on these backpacking trips." She replies, a little embarrassed herself. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Outside the car, we watch it bounce along down the road with nature on either side. <br />
                                    <br /> "Well, it's not like I'm a wild animal." Ripley explains.<br />
                                    <br /> "hey!" grunts an offended opossum from the brush. <br />
                                    <br /> "I used to think backpacking meant being nasty all the time too..." Ripley continues, now flashing back to them out in the wild hiking, complete with oversize backpack. "But I learned real quick how disastrous that actually is. I could fill a book with the kinds of things I've seen or experienced!" <br />
                                    <br /> Surrounding Ripley are a collection of maladies they've encountered on the trail.<br /> Narration: Yeast can accumulate in grubby hair and cause scalp irritation. Grimy genitals entice chafe and harbor bacteria. Dirty, dusty feet are an invitation for blisters sensitive to infection. Oral care doesn't take vacations! Soiled hands solicit nasty hand-to-mouth infections (or parasites!). Unwashed skin is ripe for irritation and rashes. <br />
                                    <br /> "What about a book on how to prevent that stuff?" Asks the friend, back in their car. "But a *Cliffs* notes version."<br />
                                    <br /> "Hah! Good one." laughs Ripley. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> "Because, honestly, how does anyone keep clean in that kind of environment?" The friend continues. "All the slimy sweat! Dirty fingernails! Dust and oils and saps and... STINK!"<br />
                                    <br /> "My friend, have you ever heard of... *water?*" Ripley asks overly-earnestly. <br />
                                    <br /> "How'd you like to *hike* home?" The friend teases back. <br />
                                    <br /> "Point taken." Ripley continues. "But seriously!"<br />
                                    <br /> Next to an illustration of Ripley washing their dirty feet next to a river, the narration reads: Dirty, sweat, and grime? A bandana and fresh water work wonders. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: You could use biodegradable soap; a little goes a long way! (though it tends to dry out my skin.) <br />
                                    <br /> One display we see "Wilderness Wash" in a bottle, a bar of "Kirk's Original Castile", and a cylindrical bottle of "Dr. Bronner's". The narration clarifies: (All soaps MUST be used and disposed of far from water sources.)<br />
                                    <br /> Above a ziplock bag containing folded-up wipes and a package of baby wipes, the narration reads: And of course if water is scarce, unscented baby/body wipes* are my go-to. *Pro tip! Soak your wipes with a heavy splash of witch hazel before your trip to extra antibacterial and inflammation-fighting power. <br />
                                    <br /> Again in the car, the friend observes, "Well, you won't catch me five steps from a trailhead without at least deodorants."<br />
                                    <br /> "Actually," Ripley interjects. "fragranced toiletries can attract bugs and bears..."<br />
                                    <br /> "Dang it!" Exclaims the friend. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Discreetly scratching her butt, the friend asks, "All right, land sharks and flying vampires aside, what about... *Swamp ass?*<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh, do you mean Monkey Butt? Crotch rot?" Jokingly asks Ripley. "Bayou Bunghole? Don't forget Pew Dew."<br />
                                    <br /> "Ah yes, a man of culture!" She teases. <br />
                                    <br /> Flashing back to the wilderness, we see a generic person standing knee-deep in a river, scrubbing between their butt cheeks with a cloth. On land in the distance, two observes react in shock and horror to this display, one person barfing by a tree. The narration explains, "Well, you can't just hose down in any ol' stream, other hikers drink that. So, this is where baby wipes are a *must*. They're sanitary and single use, reducing cross contamination. (Remember to follow Leave No Trace principles and pack out all non-biodegradable, man-made materials.)<br />
                                    <br /> Transitioning to a public restroom/shower area, we see Ripley's backpack leaning against the outside of the shower stall with their clothes strewn across a chair and on the floor. Inside the shower we can just see the backside of Ripley as they are bending over to inspect something on their front and exclaiming, "...what the??". A caption explains this is Seiad Valley, CA July 2022. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Don't forget your front bits! Smegma builds up *real fast* under your foreskin, hood, or labia folds. On my first big trip after starting HRT I didn't know smegma could harden. It took forever to carefully wash it out of my fresh, tender bottom growth..." <br />
                                    <br /> "YE-OUCH!" Yelps the friend, back in the car. "That hurts just thinking about it!"<br />
                                    <br /> "You're tellin' me!" Ripley concurs. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Little chibi-Ripley's illustrate the following narration, "All that in mind, I do my grooming right before bed to keep my sleeping back clean. Clean your face first to avoid stuff like Pink Eye. Clean from head to toe, leaving armpits and groin for last. Granola and cavities don't mix! Brush those teeth. Give your hardworking feet extra love, they deserve it! Frequently missed areas: Backs of knees. In.out of ears. Belly button. Lower back. (My calves are often so dusty it looks like a suntan!"<br />
                                    <br /> Inside the car, a tiny chibi-Ripley announces to their friend, "Lotion is my secret weapon against blisters."<br />
                                    <br /> "See? I knew you weren't completely feral." She replies like a proud mom. <br />
                                    <br /> Returning to the wild, we see a cross-section inside of a generic person's tent. The person is in a position where they were laying on their back with their feet planted on the ground. They have now raised their butt off the ground, so their only point of contact with the tent floor is their shoulders/arms and their feet. Their hands are scrubbing away at their elevated butt. <br />
                                    <br /> The narration explains, "When you get to your crotch, do your best to remove as much salt, debris, and dead skin as possible. I do this in the privacy of my tent, the poses can get pretty silly!"<br />
                                    <br /> Back in the car, the friend asks, "So, if this is your routine, why do you still... *stink?*"<br />
                                    <br /> Leaning against the half-way open window, Ripley sighs, "Oh, body odor is inevitable. You get used to it."<br />
                                    <br /> With the wilderness left behind, their little car is now swallowed up in traffic as it approaches the city. <br />
                                    <br /> "Well, for my sake let's get you to a shower as soon as possible! ...once we get through this traffic anyway..." The friend concludes. <br />

                            <strong>Friends who flog together, stay together.</strong> Genuinely so grateful for today’s <strong>whip-smart</strong> comic on this kind of impact play – something traditionally we’ve not had much coverage on, as it’s something that needs to be very carefully practiced! If this one’s inspired you, make sure to do tonnnnns of research and take it super slow and easy! Our bodies are soft and delicate and easily hurt – go slow, go easy and seek experienced guidance (I’d bet that if you live near a <a href="https://www.sheboptheshop.com/?aff=OJST" rel="noopener" target="_blank">friendly queer sex store</a>, they’ll have a class or two about this sort of thing that you can sign up for).</p>
                        <p>Support OJST in making these sorts of comics and get fun little extra strips and BTS stuffs! Truly we can’t do this without regular support, and for the price of a coffee each month, we promise to keep hiring artists to tell their stories and keep this space running and available to those who need it. Help us <strong>keep cracking the whip on creativity and fun</strong>!</p>

                                    <br /> Bowser is also a heavyset person with a build and body hair similar to Hien's, but with a pale complexion and a full head up hair that is swept up in a pointy coif. They have one big tattoo piece on their left upper arm. They wear only black gloves that come up to their forearm and we catch a glimpse of some kind of underwear.<br />
                                    <br /> The coloring of the comic is deep, warm purples and reds, with a textured pencil-y line illustrating the people and settings. For emphasis and motion lines, Hien uses a white line. Hien's style ranges from simplified chibi to a more realistic but still simplified cartoon style, with loving attention paid to body hair textures. <br />
                                    <br /> A chibi-fied Hien toddles into a dungeon room, wearing only his towel. "Good ole kinky corner at my local sauna~" He says, with flowers of excitement floating around him. "What fun new experience shall we have today?" In the background we see a large bondage cross (a life-size, upright X that people have their wrists and ankles tied to, leaving them thoroughly exposed), mirror, various cords hanging from the ceiling, and in the foreground a heavy duty metal chain. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hien!" A chibi Bowser exclaims as they swoop in upside-down from the ceiling behind Hien, like a bat that is just hanging out in an attic. "I've got just the thing!" <br />
                                    <br /> "GASP!!" Hien gasps. <br />
                                    <br /> "Allow me to introduce you to *floggers*!" A normal-size Bowser explains as they gesture at a large, detailed drawing of a flogger that has appeared over their heads. It shows a handle that is covered in patterned straps with a loose wrist strap coming off the very end. At the other end is a cluster of dozens of straps, reminiscent of a mop- but made out of leather and it's for kinky stuff. "Loud, dramatic, and not very painful. A staple in the impact play fantasy!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!" Hien chirps, still in his chibi state with his eyes EXTRA big. <br />
                                    <br /> Now both people returned to their normal sizes and more realistically drawn, Hien ventures as he spreads his arms and legs to attach to the bondage cross, "I've been wanting to give flogging a try, but I do admit to being a bit scared..." <br />
                                    <br /> "that's alright!" Bowser reassures him. "I'll start with one light flog, and you tell me how it feels okay?" The leather strips of the flogger swish casually in front of Hien's nude backside. <br />
                                    <br /> "Okay!" He agrees anxiously. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE TWO<br /> Hien flinches as the first WHAP! lands on his backside. "Waah-" He yelps, and then his expression changes immediately to surprise and revelation as he exhales a soft "-oh..."<br />
                                    <br /> "On a pain scale of one to ten, how was it?" Bowswer asks good naturedly. <br />
                                    <br /> "That was like a light tap... a one!" Hien shares, still deep in his surprise and processing of the new sensation. "Keep going!"<br />
                                    <br /> WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! Criss-crossing white motion lines with pink splotchy explosions fill up the panel. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'm warming you up with a steady tempo, flogging in a figure eight back and forth." Explains Bowser as the motion lines and WHAP! sound effects fall across Hien's lower back and butt. "The longer and thinner an instrument is, the more it stings. Floggers are soft and cover a fair area, so they should feel like nice blunt thuds."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE THREE<br /> Bowser strokes a comforting gloved hand down the back of Hien's neck to the space between his shoulders. <br />
                                    <br /> "It's so windy with how much air the flogger moves around..." Hien observes during the pause. "It's... relaxing, almost..." <br />
                                    <br /> WHAP!!! Bowser unleashes the most forceful flogger hit yet. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ah!" Hien exclaims. "That's a three!"<br />
                                    <br /> Against a black background we see white motion lines over an electric pink explosion, accompanying a WHAP! and an "Ah!", which repeats a second time. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien's face is a mix of emotions, his eyebrows are furrowed and eyes squeezed closed, but at the same time he looks content and kind of relaxed. "Aa-" he exhales. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hehe!" Giggles Bowser impishly behind him. <br />
                                    <br /> "Oh!!! I hate you!" Hien pretends to fume. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Against a black background, a bubble of narration reads, "Playing with expectations is a truly beautiful part of flogging." <br />
                                    <br /> Another word balloon starts to say, "Is it now-" but is interrupted by swift white motion lines and a pink explosion with the sound effect WHAP! "Ah!" someone cries out in the blackness. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE FOUR<br />
                                    <br /> In an intimate shot, we see Bowser's hand tenderly pressing against Hien's butt as he quivers. Bowsers big belly with delicate, beautiful hair is close to Hien's back as well. <br />
                                    <br /> "Feels good?" Asks Bowser. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah. Whoa. I'm really getting into it..." Hien replies as he drifts from spacey-ness back to reality. <br />
                                    <br /> "I don't do well with pain, so I wasn't sure how I was gonna go..." Hien continues as Bowswer strokes his back with his gloved hand. "But, when you grabbed me neck... It felt like you were saying "trust me," and it made me feel safe."Bowswer's hand continues to stroke up Hien's back to his shoulders and neck. "From that point, I was able to let go of my reservations and focus on the new sensations, new sounds, new rhythm of the present. There's a lot of similarities between flogging and my own Shibari practice!"<br />
                                    <br /> In a silly turn, Hien transforms into a big, fuzzy pointy-eared dog smiling with his tongue out but still has his glasses on as Bowser gives his butt a good scratch. <br />
                                    <br /> "Plus, it felt really nice to have someone's entire attention on me! Hehe!" Dog Hien continues, leaning into his butt scratch. <br />
                                    <br /> "Aw, cute pup!" Coos Bowser. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE FIVE<br />
                                    <br /> Bowser's gloved hand now clicks on a Magic Wand vibrator as he says, "And, of course... Aftercare." and begins to stroke it over Hien's butt. <br />
                                    <br /> "Ooooohhhh.... Yeessss...." Moans Hien happily. <br />
                                    <br /> As Hien leans in to the vibrational massage, he reverts to his chibi-self and coos, "I've gotta get me one of these Magic Wands..." <br />
                                    <br /> "Good isn't it?" His friend agrees encouragingly. <br />
                                    <br /> Reverting back to his more realistically-drawn self, Hien agrees, "It is good! And even better is that I feel closer to you, Bowser." <br />
                                    <br /> With an affectionate wink, Bowser replies, "Same here, sweetie."<br />
                                    <br /> With the boys out of view, we overhear them continuing to talk while we're left to look at the discarded black gloves, flogger, and Magic Wand. <br /> "Alright! What other instruments have you got?" A voice asks. <br /> "You might need a whole 'nother comic for these, Hien." Comes the answer. <br /> "Yell yeah! Try me!" He replies. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> Garden Witch by Drew Green is drawn in a cute, bouncy, cartoony art style with vibrant pastel hues. <br />
                                    <br /> Parker is a big hunk of a man with a big soft belly, a close-cropped beard, and soft dark skin. He wears a tight, stylish berry-colored baseball cap, a white tank top, purple jean shorts, yellow sneakers, and a denim jacket decorated with shiny gold pins that complement his one crescent moon earring and thin gold necklace with a pearl-like stone in its center. His golden magic wand sports another crescent moon at its top.<br />
                                    <br /> Gary is a slightly smaller man with a similar build as Parker. He wears a red beanie over his mess of auburn hair that matches his beard and mustache. His shirt sleeves are rolled up and his short green shorts are held up with suspenders. For work safety he sports thick gloves and boots to match. His green magic wand has a small green leaf sprouts at the top, just below the pink flower bud-esque orb that sparks pink sparkles. <br />
                                    <br /> We begin our story outside a strip of small, appealing shops, with our focus going straight to Garden Witch, which sports flourishing plants in window boxes outside and a modern glass greenhouse attached to the side of the brick building. A giant pointy witch's hat sits askance on the corner of the building. <br />
                                    <br /> "Sooo..." A voice emanates from inside the arboretum. "You're NOT gonna eat that lunch I brought ya?" <br />
                                    <br /> "That was so sweet, Parker, but this HUGE order has to go out today and my plants are acting awfully FUSSY!" Now inside the arboretum, we see that Gary is replying while wrangling with a man-sized Venus Flytrap-esque potted plant with multiple biting and shrieking heads of different sizes. A small one chomps down on his beefy forearm as he holds his magic wand aloft in his free hand.<br />
                                    <br /> "I mean, I've still got most of my lunch break left." Parker says while checking his watch on his one wrist, while still holding the takeout bag of lunch in his other hand. "I can help you out until I need to get back."<br />
                                    <br /> "Ohmygosh, I would love that!" Exclaims Gary as he tries to pull his magic wand back from a plant head that's chomped down on the pink orb at its top. <br />
                                    <br /> "Let's take care of this grumpy guy first." Like a pro, Parker uses his crescent moon-topped magic wand to lull the bitey plant into a content slumber. "Also, next lunch is on YOU, Gary."<br />
                                    <br /> "Deal!" Gary happily cries out.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> In a montage, the burly men work together with their magic wands to harvest magical flower buds and incite blue flowers to sprout and bloom. While hoisting a giant bag of seed to pour into another container, Parker's hand unintentionally finds itself gripping onto Gary's soft midsection. With a squeeze, both Gary and Parker suddenly realize where Parker's hand is and they look at each other with a moment of being startled. The surprise is short-lived as the two abandon their task to fall into a passionate embrace, locking lips while hearts and sparkles erupt around them and pink flowers bloom on the plants behind them. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> The two are engulfed in a magical pink aura as they make out. Gary turns his back to Parker as he pulls up his shirt, revealing his patchily hairy chest and big round belly. Parker continues to nuzzle Garry from behind and run his hands over Gary's front. The pink flower buds behind them grow and sparkle. <br />
                                    <br /> "WAIT, on sec!" Gary interrupts in shock. <br />
                                    <br /> From outside the store, we see the "OPEN" sign flip around to "CLOSED".<br />
                                    <br /> Back inside, our boys are now fully nude save for their socks, with Parker wearing only his golden necklace and earring. Gary holds Parker's cock in one hand, his foreskin leaving a small extra adornment on his hardening cock. <br />
                                    <br /> "So, where shall we do this?" Parker asks as he leans against the glass wall that Gary has his back to. He is very slightly taller than Gary, so Gary has to look up to meet his eye contact. <br />
                                    <br /> "The flower?" Asks Gary as he gestures to an enormous, couch-sized pink blossom. <br />
                                    <br /> "The flower!" Concurs Parker.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Flopping backwards onto the giant, cushy flower, Gary's circumcised cock hardens in anticipation of Parker crawling over an enormous petal to reach him. Upon reaching him, Parker goes to town on Gary's junk, sucking on his balls and running his tongue up Gary's fully erect dick in one slow lap, soliciting a bead of pre-cum from the tip. Gary reclines back with his eyes closed, feeling magical sparkles, as Parker continues to keep his mouth on his dick while also reaching upwards to tweak Gary's nipples. The magical background flowers and sparkles grow and grow, filling up the panels until suddenly-<br />
                                    <br /> "Ohp!" Gary gasps, his orgasm exploding from his cock in full force and the flowers sparkling at maximum force. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Now reclining in the after-glow, Gary suggests, "I'd say that's a job well-done!"<br />
                                    <br /> "It was hard work, but somebody had to do it!" Laughs Parker. <br />
                                    <br /> "WORK!! Oh no!" Gary shouts in horror. "You'll get in trouble! I've kept you far too long!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Shh," Parker calmly reassures his flustered boyfriend. "you'll stress out the plants."<br />
                                    <br /> With a wink, Parker continues, "I can just call out for the rest of the day and help you pack these babies up! It's fine!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Th-that's true, heh." Agrees Gary. "You know..."<br />
                                    <br /> Outside the shop we can see that flowers have blossomed all over the storefront, with some gigantic pink blooms erupting out of the roof. Even the witch's hat decoration on the corner of the building now sports a big pink flower in its band. <br />
                                    <br /> "I'm not sure we have enough flowers." Gary's voice continues through a window. "Should we... bloom some more?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh, I'm VERY down." Agrees the voice of Parker from inside the shop.<br />

                                    <br /> Sara self describes as a late 20's/early 30's cis woman, clean cut and a little shy in self-expression/body language. Her color palette is in the cooler range with her brown hair in a chin-length bob with short side bangs, a couple of understated ear piercings, and a propensity for wearing sweaters.<br />
                                    <br /> She describes Nathan as a late 20's/early 30's cis man with golden retriever energy and the colors to match. His face is hairy with a short beard and blond hair pulled back into a tiny ponytail. He often wears sunny yellow fishing shirts and his expressions are bright, tender, and honest.<br />
                                    <br /> "Sara!" Nathan calls in astonishment, looking outside his window. "New bird at the feeder!"<br />
                                    <br /> "That's a Northern Flicker!" Sara exclaims as she joins him with a cup of coffee in hand. The tan bird with black, gray, and orange accents pecks away at the feeder, oblivious to its audience in the window. <br />
                                    <br /> "I must draw it." He states, eyes still round in awe and surprise. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Romantic relationships- trust, intimacy, authenticity- are challenging for me. <br />
                                    <br /> Nathan draws with intensity and deep concentration in his sketchbook as Sara looks over his shoulder with calm and contentedness. The words "CONCENTRATION" with little stars and sparklies surround the couple. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But here, with my partner Nathan, has been a safe place to grow. We've been together two years.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Sara gives Nathan a verbal thumbs-up emoji as Nathan proudly shows her his drawing.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And joy has been our way forward. <br />
                                    <br /> The scene pivots from warm golden colors to a deep gray with ice cold blues. Sara stands in the shadow of giant oppressive stone letters reading "PURITY" that tower over her while she shrinks into herself in shame. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I come from a strict background, where sexuality was seen as so dangerous and taboo that- <br /> X romantic relationships,<br /> X desire,<br /> X having a physical body, <br /> X and even feeling too much of a positive emotion<br /> -became labeled dangerous too. <br />
                                    <br /> Now back to more natural colors, Sara sits inside of a giant soap bubble (which dulls her coloring) reading a cumbersome map that is labeled "HOW TO GET OUT OF THE BUBBLE" while Nathan stands outside in the open air. He is looking at her questioningly with a book in his hand labeled "THE BUBBLE"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I found safety in that old environment by numbing my emotions down, and keeping others at arm's length. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> At a comic convention, Sara sits are her brightly colored table that displays her variety of pretty minicomics. She is looking wistfully at something we can't see. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I know I'm safe with Nathan. <br />
                                    <br /> We see now that it is Nathan she is looking at, who is chatting and buying comics from a fellow exhibitor across the aisle. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: He's kind, gentle, and generous. <br />
                                    <br /> She watches as he returns with an armload of new books and comics, looking absolutely delighted. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: His heart is always on his face. <br />
                                    <br /> "Need a break?" He asks Sara. "I can watch your table!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I feel seen, believed, and loved when he looks at me. <br />
                                    <br /> Outside riding bikes, Sara and Nathan cruise through a green bike trail with bushes of big purple flowers and butterflies. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Naturally, teaching my body it's safe to be playful and honest is taking time and practice after many years of survival mode. Every day is a work in progress, but I'm improving. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br />
                                    <br /> Sara and Nathan are inside again, sharing a big curry bowl and each has a boba drink by them. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Once a dull, controlled glow, now delight comes easily and lights up my whole body.<br />
                                    <br /> "This is amazing!" Nathan exclaims as they chow down on the curry. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Sharing joy with Nathan is building a new framework for my nervous system, where I'm safe to show up as my true self, and trust that he loves me for who I am. <br />
                                    <br /> Snuggling together on the couch with their cat shared across both their laps, Nathan declares to Sara, "You're CUTE and GOOD and I love you.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I haven't been able to be sexual with him yet, and that's okay. Nathan often reassures me he's happy with our pace. There's no pressure. In time, I hope we'll be able to explore sexual intimacy together, as these small, precious moments of connection continue to add up.<br />
                                    <br /> Leaning on a wooden handrail in the woods as the sunsets, Sara says, "I love you too." as Nathan blushes in happiness.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: More and more often, I'm noticing when I'm happy. <br />
                                    <br /> In the full sun, Nathan and Sara lay on their backs on a blanket on the grass, their books close at hand. They hold hands, gazing up at the sky. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Noticing more things I love about him. About us. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Narration: I love being with him. I love this life we're creating together. <br />
                                    <br /> In their backyard, Sara carries a box of young plant starts to Nathan, who is crouched at a grow box with a trowel in hand. "Wanna pickle beets this year?" She asks him. <br />
                                    <br /> "Yeah!" He exclaims. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I want to keep going. I want to keep feeling, exploring caring.<br />
                                    <br /> Now at a dock, Nathan helps Sara get into a row boat. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Because this joy feels real. <br />
                                    <br /> Sitting together again on the couch, Nathan and Sara watch TV as they crochet. <br />
                                    <br /> "OMG!" Sara shouts in delighted disbelief at the TV while Nathan appears stunned at whatever it is they're watching. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It feels like me. <br />
                                    <br /> The two of them crack up together on the couch, falling into each others arms as their crochet is forgotten for the moment. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It feels like home.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE ONE<br /> The rain is pouring down outside a Magic Shop. Tending the counter is a friendly green male goblin shopkeeper with large pointed ears, one of which has a small gold ring piercing. He wears a tan shirt with a brown workman's apron over it, and an orange kerchief over his head, tucked behind his ears so they flare out on either side of his head. <br />
                                    <br /> The shopkeep looks on in horror as a tall, blond haired, tanned male elf enters his shop with a soaking floor-length cloak and proceeds to drip water across the floor as he studiously goes about his shopping. He goes over his list, checking off the items that he's collected in his basket- A glass container with the round bottom full of a blue liquid, a bushel of lavender, and some pink crystals. <br />
                                    <br /> "I think that's all I need..." The elf says to himself, eyes fixed on his shopping list. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hey there, adventurer!" The goblin interrupts with a customer service smile. "Mind if I help you with your cloak?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Oh! Sure." The elf responds distractedly until he is snapped to attention by two blue disembodied translucent hands poof into existence at his shoulders, lifting off his soaking cloak. Immediately smitten, he asks, "Huh. What are those glowing hands?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Those are cast with scrolls of Mage Hand!" Explains the goblin. "They're suuuper helpful if you've ever needed assistance carrying, lifting, opening doors..." <br />
                                    <br /> The elf considers the possibilities, such as a hand opening a door, cleaning a sword, or washing a cucumber.<br />
                                    <br /> "...Anything you can think of where you wish you had an extra pair of hands." Concludes the shopkeeper. <br />
                                    <br /> The elf swipes off an armload of scrolls from a shelf and declares, "I'll take ten!" <br />
                                    <br /> "You got it!" Agrees the goblin. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE TWO<br /> Now alone, the elf summons one of the magical, glowing blue hands and gives the back of it a kiss, like a knight kissing the ring of a monarch. The camera pulls back to reveal our elf is reclining on lavender pillows, clad only in a flimsy purple bedroom robe. Three hands hover around him, pulling away his gown and running their fingers over his thigh, back, and hip. "Mmm" He coos. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE THREE<br /> "Mmmmh~" He groans as he rolls onto his chest with his ass lifted high in the air and just a peek of his cock showing between his legs. One glowing hand continues to stroke down his ribcage towards his lifted rear end while the other two hands busy themselves opening a bottle of lube and pouring it onto the expectant blue fingers. Deftly, the slipper hand drips the liquid between the cheeks of the elf as another hand grips him at his hips. A hand artfully teases two fingers into the elf with a "squelch"<br />
                                    <br /> "Ah~" The elf coos in pleasure as he gripes his pillow. "Oh gods~" He continues as the hands slide up and down his back, his hips, and tease his ass. "This feels SO nice, but I wish I had something a big bigger than just- AH!" He gasps as an idea hits him. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE FOUR<br /> He retrieves another scroll from his sack, which the floating hands hold open as he writes his own notes onto the parchment. Another hand rests on his shoulder encouragingly. A magical POOF fills the air and as the cloud disperses a giant floating, translucent blue dong floats over our extremely pleased elf's head. The edited scroll floats overhead as well, reading "MAGE HAND[Crossed out]" with a handwritten "DONG" in blue ink now added beneath the scratched out word. The hands clap and give him the thumbs up as he laughs in delight at his ingenuity. <br />
                                    <br /> Now back to business, the elf is flipped on his back by a hand raising up his leg, exposing his hole. The magical dildo readies itself just a few inches away. The elf's own boner is at full mast, straining against his stomach. <br />
                                    <br /> "AH!" The elf calls out in pleasure as the big blue phallus pushes into his small opening. "Oh gods." Propping himself up on his elbows, the hands hold his legs in the air as the dildo thrusts away and the elf melts into bliss.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE FIVE<br /> "Ah!" He gasps as a hand pins his own wrists in place over his head. "gods~ oh mmh!" He pants while the dildo thrusts rhythmically and another hand jerks him off, a bead of pre-cum forming at the head of his cock until finally- "OOOHHHHHHHH" -he erupts, lost in his pleasure. <br />
                                    <br /> Unfortunately, with his concentration broken, the Mage Hands and Dong vanish in a puff. "Oops." The left chuckles to himself, still recovering from his climax. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: Later...<br /> "How many scrolls do you need???" Demands the goblin, back in his shop, at the madly grinning elf's full armload of rolled up parchments. <br />

                            <p>Hien’s Blog Note!<br /> Many many MANY thanks to <a href="https://www.twistedmonk.com/?rfsn=328421.56faa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twisted Monk</a> for their generosity in sending me such a lovely care package of these quality ropes! I swear by their hemp ropes and would recommend them to everyone getting into Shibari! Their whipping (how a rope’s strands are bound together at its ends) is absolutely stunning AND they’ll even replace ropes for free if they were cut for safety reasons during play! Thank you as well to <a href="https://www.theduchy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TheDuchy</a> for all the ties I got to learn for this comic! If you’re new to buying ropes, <a href="https://www.theduchy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TheDuchy</a> has their own recommendations that pointed me in the right direction when I first started. Thank you as always to my editors for bearing with me nerding out on Shibari all the time, haha! Appreciate y’all!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> Our narrator, Hien Pham, is a Southeast Asian cisgender heavyset man with a short, bushy, black beard, fuzzy body hair, and glasses. He is mostly bald on top, with the rest of his hair pulled back into a proud bun.<br />
                                    <br /> The Masturbateers are a fictional cast of diverse characters who demonstrates practices, positions, and techniques in Oh Joy Sex Toy comics. Today's Masturbateer is a sturdy person with a plump belly, and a bushy brown mustache with mutton chops. They have a receding hairline with the back portion of their hair pulled into a small ponytail. They have a hairy chest, arms, legs, and a smattering of hair at the bottom of their belly. <br />
                                    <br /> A handful of different types of bound ropes in a variety of colors and textures fill the panel. Chibi versions of Hien and the Masturbateer marvel in wonder at the ropes bundles that tower over them. <br />
                                    <br /> With hearts in his eyes, Hien exclaims, "Smooth nylon, cozy hemp, even sadistic wool! Ah! I’m so excited!! The wonderful folks at Twisted Monk sent me a whole heap of their handmade ropes to test and review!"<br />
                                    <br /> Juggling bundles of brightly colored ropes, the Masturbateer remarks, "I didn’t realize there were so many materials on the market! Is there a big difference between them?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Absolutely!" Hien responds confidently, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "Different fibres affect not only the type of ropework you can do - but also the sensory experience of rope on skin!"<br />
                                    <br /> Hien continues, "Alongside looks and cost, each rope also differs in these categories:"<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Suspension<br /> Image: A foot lifts upwards as a hand pulls the ropes bound around the ankle. The rope runs through a hoop suspended in the air. <br /> Caption: Ties that lift part of or the full body off the ground are suspension - otherwise, it’s floorwork! Not all ropes are strong enough to suspend!<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Comfort<br /> Image: A close-up of three different types of ropes. One is tightly coil bound, one has a brickwork design, and the other is also coil bound but much hairier.<br /> Caption: Rough, grippy ropes have great tooth! They hold knots and vibrate better than slippery ropes, which wear smoother and gentler on the skin.<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Vibrations<br /> Image: Two ropes criss-cross in a soft X, with lots of little vibration-motion lines dancing along them.<br /> Caption: When rope is pulled against rope, the friction produces vibrations! This is a fairly subjective benchmark, but I personally believe it is quite an important pleasure to the rope experience!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Hemp<br /> Image of bundled magenta hemp rope.<br />
                                    <br /> Caption:<br /> Suspension: YES<br /> Comfort: 4/5<br /> Vibrations: 5/5<br /> Cost: $44.99 / 30ft<br />
                                    <br /> Hien gets to working tying the magenta rope in a design over the Masturbateer's chest, while they narrate, "It feels soft but very solid! There’s a heft to it!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Right?" Hien concurs. "That heft makes it easy to work with! It’s got such good tooth and holds strong, tight knots! Hemp is my gold standard for sure! The weave’s grooves make for satisfying vibrations and beautiful marks afterward."<br />
                                    <br /> "Ah-mmm…" Coos the Masturbateer as the ripes tighten and vibrate. "Off to a lovely start…"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Title: Cotton<br /> Image of cotton lavender rope.<br />
                                    <br /> Caption:<br /> Suspension: NO<br /> Comfort: 4.5/5<br /> Vibrations: 3/5<br /> Cost: $26.99 / 30ft<br /> Bottom Section:<br />
                                    <br /> Now working on the Masturbateer's forearm with a wrap of lavender rope, Hien continues, "I’ve seen far too many flat cotton ropes, but I’m impressed with how sturdy Twisted Monk’s cotton is! Cotton stretches and might get loose while tying, which I don’t personally like, but it’s still a good budget option!"<br />
                                    <br /> "Vibrations are duller," The Masturbateer observes, "but it also feels more forgiving to wear than hemp! I can deffo sport these for longer!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Title: Posh<br /> Image of posh rose rope.<br />
                                    <br /> Caption:<br /> Suspension: YES<br /> Comfort: 4/5<br /> Vibrations: 4.5/5<br /> Cost: $29.99 / 30ft<br />
                                    <br /> "This spun polyester stays a tad lighter and smoother than hemp while retaining great tooth!" Hien explains as they bind the Masturbateer's ankles and loop the rope up over their black boxers and around their neck. "It’s a bit stiff to start with, but can be made softer fairly easily."<br />
                                    <br /> The Masturbateer chimes in, "With how affordable it is, I can see POSH making up a whole kit on its own! Though I do have to admit I miss the funky earthy smell of organic fibres."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Right Section: Nylon<br /> Image of magenta nylon rope.<br /> Caption:<br /> Suspension: WITH CAUTION<br /> Comfort: 3.75/5<br /> Vibrations: 2/5<br /> Cost: $26.99 / 30ft<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Now showing off the ropework on the Masturbateer's boxer-clad backside, Hien explains, "Nylon’s radiant colours are simply UNRIVALED! Some even react to UV light and glow in the dark! It feels solid, but wears quite smooth! Doesn’t have much tooth, though, so the vibrations aren’t great. Despite its slipperiness, nylon can be used for suspension with caution!"<br />
                                    <br /> "This might be my fave!" Adds the Masturbateer, showing off their roped butt harness. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br />
                                    <br /> Title: Wool<br /> Image: A bundle of pale, hairy rope.<br /> Caption:<br /> Suspension: NO<br /> Cofort 1/5<br /> Vibrations: 4/5<br /> Cost: $62.99/30ft<br />
                                    <br /> "Wool is one of Twisted Monk's latest offerings, and I just cannot stop talking about it!" Hien exalts, eyes wide. <br />
                                    <br /> "Uh... Hien? There's no one we know who likes wool..." The Masturbateer adds, looking perplexed. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien then proceeds to tie a rope harness around his own chest as he narrates, "Putting on a Sutton wool chest harness felt like a delicious punishment. Wool is sadistically coarse and horrendously scratchy, but that unabated prickliness is the best thing about it! The fibre itches my skin, yet with every subtle movement I make it scratches that itch just enough for some relief without allowing me any lasting satisfaction." <br />
                                    <br /> A chibi version of Hien dressed as a lamb bounds across the page, exclaiming, "I was enthralled by the fine balance between pain and pleasure that wool managed to thread! However, I can only recommend it to those actively looking for a punishing sensory experience!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> "I love the sound of these ropes, Hien!" The Masturbateer says, but looks perplexed. "But... I'm still not sure where to start..."<br />
                                    <br /> Reassuringly, Hien answers, "Wool aside, you can't really go wrong! Figure out your priority, and go from there!"<br />
                                    <br /> An info graphic fills the page, showing a rope sample next to each title and description: <br /> Text:<br /> -Go NYLON if you want the most vibrant and radiant colours for your ties and harnesses!<br /> -Value comfort most of all and not looking for suspension? Consider COTTON!<br /> -HEMP is my number one recommendation for putting together a solid, all-around versatile kit!<br /> -POSH is more durable than natural fibres and considerably cheaper! Perfect for suspension!<br /> -Seasoned folks looking for a new challenging sensory experience? WOOL will definitely provide!<br />
                                    <br /> The rope harness now removed, Hien runs his hands over the marks left behind on his flesh while observing, "At the end of the day, the ropes are simply vessels for intimacy. Skillful hands can deliver beautiful experiences regardless of the tools, after all! As long as you have fun, whatever that means to you, that's all that really matters!"<br />
                                    <br /> Chasing the Masturbateer with a rope), Hien devlishly exclaims, "Now, why don't you come here and try on this wool!!"<br /> "Eek!" The Masturbeet shrieks, with their legs spinning, "You'll have to catch me first!"<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Ripley LaCross draws todays comic in a cartoony style using a color palette of dusty yellow, orange, brown, and purple. It's warm and summery. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 1<br /> In a backyard garden, we see a woman knelt next to one of many grow boxes. Aimee is slim, wearing a kerchief over her short, black hair, leaving her bangs exposed. She wears an orange and brown plaid working shirt tied up into a crop top, leaving her midriff exposed above her purple apron that splits apart in the back to reveal her bare bottom. She wears gardening gloves on her hands and crocks on her feet. A purple hose with a spray nozzle snakes across the garden and rests, inactive, in the grow box next to Aimee's hands as they dig.<br />
                                    <br /> "Phew!" she exclaims, wiping sweat from their brow, completely unsuspecting of Carrie who hides behind a leafy trellis with a tricked-out super soaker water gun. Carrie is slightly curvier than Aimee, though not by much. Her long blonde hair is pulled back in a messy ponytail and she wears a black sports bra with baggy shorts and no shoes. <br />
                                    <br /> Aimee is engrossed in her gardening, tearing her attention away from it only to admire a butterfly that lands on her gloved hand... until Carrie own hand reaches from off camera to take one of Aimee's apron strings delicately between her sneaky fingers, not yet tugging on it- but Aimee's alert system switches on.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> "Not so fast, buster!" Announces Aimee as she fires the hose on a completely unprepared Carrie, who shrieks. <br />
                                    <br /> "HAH!" Aimee taunts at the trellis Carrie dashes behind for cover as she regroups. "You thought you could take me down that easily??" <br />
                                    <br /> "Your RAIN of terror is over!" Carrie crows as she launches her second attack, shooting a stream of water from her super soaker behind the cover of the trellis. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hah!" Aimee chuffs defiantly, not even noticing that her button-up shirt has fallen completely open, exposing her breasts. "We'll see about that." she continues cooly, pointing the hose nozzle menacingly. "...Uh..." Aye is frozen in her power stance as only a single drop of water lazily spits out of her weapon. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> "What a sordid TWIST of fate." Carrie taunts Aimee, nonchalantly revealing that she tied the hose into a big cartoonish bow tie that she holds in her outstretched hand. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hey!" explodes Aimee.<br />
                                    <br /> Aimee's fate seems secure as Carrie asks "...any last words?" with her water gun pointed squarely at her defenseless target. <br />
                                    <br /> Sheepishly, Aimee offers "Perhaps..." as she begins to pull back her apron, revealing her coyly posed legs. Carrie's lust is awakened as the fabric reveals more. <br />
                                    <br /> "HAVE A DRINK!" Aimee announces as she pulls out not one but two water guns from somewhere between the folds of her apron. Her cleanly shaved cootch peeks out as the apron flares around her. <br />
                                    <br /> Carrie is doused with a mighty FWOOSH.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Woozy and dazed, Carry crawls on her belly, reaching out desperately for her own water gun that was knocked free of her grip. Aimee is having none of that, though, and easily kicks the gun even further away. <br />
                                    <br /> "Well, well, well..." Aimee says, flipping Carrie onto her back and straddling her. With her left hand, she pins Carrie's hands over her head, and with her right hand, she forms her fingers into the shape of a gun and sticks it under Carrie's jaw. "Looks like you're in HOT WATER now."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Carrie looks at her captor with shock and frustration until her expression suddenly shifts to one of devilish glee as she explains, "...good thing I've got one last trick up my sleeve..."<br />
                                    <br /> "Huh?" Aimee yelps as Carrie's dextrous foot grabs one of Aimee's apron strings, pulling it sharply. As her apron pulls entirely off of her, she shrieks "Hey!" and then "...Uh oh." as Carrie seizes her distraction to pounce on her like a hungry tiger. Her croc'd feet kick in the air while Carrie dives on her, squirt guns forgotten. Laughter and shrieking fills the air and we end on an image of butterflies landing on the discarded apron and a croc.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Todays comic is drawn by Lumen, who draws us a fantastic medical nsfw bj comic. Lumen is a master at drawing armor, and utilized sheens and shines against subtle 'noise and textures' to really make make these armored characters pop. It's tones in warm and inviting colors, that encourages us as readers to pick up a level of fondness and intimacy's between the characters. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 1<br /> We see a wide shot of two medieval knights gallop at each other in a game of joust, their long lances squared off at each other while the crowd goes wild. Inside a tent ear by, two other knights in full armor wait their turn. <br />
                                    <br /> As described by the author, Arthur wears a full set of armor inspired by Maximilian Armor, made from light, polished metal with gilded details. It is slim cut to accentuate with a sharp waist with fluted details on the chestplate, gorget and pauldrons as well as etched rose leaves on the chestplate. He wears a closed helmet with a visor that has similar rose leave etchings, an angular slit for vision and simple flower indentations in the front. <br />
                                    <br /> His helmet has a bright red plume, the same color as the leather buckles and fastenings on his armor. There is a green, rectangular piece of fabric attached to the right side of his waist, similar to a Waffenrock. It shows a simplified, powder pink rose with dark green leaves, the coat of arms of his house. The visible bits of his trousers are a warm brown and his codpiece is fastened with red strings. He has fair skin and auburn hair.<br />
                                    <br /> Basil wears a similar set of armor, heavily inspired by Arthurs, implying the same armorer made them. His armor is made with fewer intricacies, from darker metal but with the same fluting details on the chestplate and pauldrons. He has the rose from Arthurs Waffenrock etched into his chestplate, implying he is in service of the crown. His helmet sports a simple visor, with a slit for vision, that can be pushed up, revealing a slightly tanned complexion with a dark brown chin strap style beard with a hint of gray. He has a hooked nose and there is a scar on his left cheek, running from the beginning of the beard to his cheekbone. His pants are a dark gray, the fastenings and leather details of his armor are a dark red. <br />
                                    <br /> "Can you stop pacing?" Basil demands at the startled Silver Knight. "You will tire yourself out before you even get on a horse."<br />
                                    <br /> The camera and panels pan back and forth to show us their helmet adorned faces. <br /> "I can't help it!" Wails Arthur. "I'M NERVOUS! How about you give me a kiss for good luck instead of ribbing me?"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> The comic takes a few quiet beats.<br /> "A kiss, huh?" Says Basil, pushing Arthur backwards against the edge of a table, looming over them in the moments before an embrace. "I have a better idea, hon."<br />
                                    <br /> "Ah-" Gasps Arthur in anticipation and delight, light spools in framing the couple as they start to embrace.<br />
                                    <br /> With a CLANK Basil drops to his knees between the other's legs and tugs at the red cord securing Arthur's red fabric codpiece in place. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> "Getting hard for me already." Basil muses as he pulls his helmet back just far enough to reveal his short brown beard, lips, and nose- but not his eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> "Sh-shut up..." Arthur stammers, his red pubic hair exposed along with a beautiful pink-beige cock with foreskin pulled back just enough to reveal a darker shade of pinky-brown on the head. While the knight's penis has overall a typical length and proportions, the underside has a somewhat more pronounced bulge that curves more thickly around the middle of the shaft. <br />
                                    <br /> Licking and sucking that cock, Basil deftly pushes his gloved hand into the Silver's Knight's hole, rubbing the inside with expert, minute movements. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> With a final, firm press of the finger, Basil elicits an "Ah ah HAH" from Arthur, who cracks the table edge from the force of his grip. <br /> An "AHHHHHH!!!" erupts from the tent, startling the passers-by. <br />
                                    <br /> "Holy..." gasps Arthur.<br />
                                    <br /> "Always happy to serve the crown." Smirks Basil as they wipe away traces of fluid from his exposed cheek with his gloved hand, his eyes still covered by the helmet. Delicately, they re-tie the red cord on Arthur's codpiece. <br />
                                    <br /> "Don't be smug." Huffs Arthur. "That wasn't even a proper kiss!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Rising to his feet to loom over Arthur once again, he smirks out a "Greedy." before placing a sweet smooch on the forehead of the knight's silver helmet. <br />
                                    <br /> Pulling back, Basil smiles, saying "You'll do amazing. Now..." In two quick gestures Basil pulls back the tent's entry flap and lays a mighty CLAP on Arthur's firm bottom with a smack of his gauntleted hand. "GO GET 'EM!"<br />
                                    <br /> With that, Arthur regally emergences from the tent to his cheering crowd. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> Todays semi-autobiographical comic is made by Hein Pham. It's beautifully rendered! It has the two following characters; Hien Pham is a Southeast Asian cisgender heavy set man with a short, bushy, black beard, fuzzy body hair, and glasses. He is mostly bald on top, with the rest of his hair pulled back into a proud bun. <br />
                                    <br /> Jacob is a light-skinned heavy set man with a good covering of body hair and a short cut for his brown hair and trim beard. <br />
                                    <br /> The scene starts at night, outside of a home in Australia, rain pouring down on the clay roof tiles. <br /> Jacob reads in bed, comfortably supported by pillows. <br />
                                    <br /> "What beautiful weather to read hot smut~" Jacob says as he turns the page. "Kinda reminds me of Hien's stuff, actually... Wonder what he's up to-" <br />
                                    <br /> "JACOB!!!" Hien exclaims as he literally kicks through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man, wearing nothing but his boxers and the sketchbook he carries in one hand. "I have compiled a list of cuddle positions and I need your help to find THE SUBJECTIVE BEST ONE!!! This could be my most important comic yet!!!"<br />
                                    <br /> "What are we waiting for?" Jacob replies in delight as he flings his clothing off. <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> "This is my go-to! I love feeling all of you on my belly!" Coos Hien. "I can play with your hair... and your chest..." <br />
                                    <br /> "Mmmmmm" Concurs Jacob dreamily. <br />

                                    <br /> "I could be really engaged in the cuddle, or be multi-tasking just chilling like this." Jacob says. <br />

Jacob is softly curled on his side, using Hien's belly as a pillow, with one hand sneakily resting under Hien's boxers on his upper inner thigh. <br />
                                    <br /> "I could transition into something naughty while I'm down here~" Mischievously suggests Jacob as Hien sticks out his tongue playfully. <br />

                                    <br /> "I quite like the pressure sensation..." Jacob says. "...but I don't like being on my belly for too long."<br />
                                    <br /> Second image: Hien is now laying on his belly on the floor, looking quite strained and red-faced as Jacob lays over his back perpendicularly. <br />

                                    <br /> "Similarly light position, but somehow feels more intimate." Observes Jacob. "A good cuddle for when I don't really want to cuddle. <br />

                                    <br /> "Now this is a classic!" Exclaims Hien. "The key here is not being afraid to adjust."<br />
                                    <br /> "I might move my arm in a bit, but I'm happy as we are now." Jacob concludes. <br />

                                    <br /> "There's something truly so special about feeling someone resting on your chest." Observes Jacob. <br />

                                    <br /> "Yeah, it is a bit intense in this position, isn't it?" Hien agrees, shyly looking away from Jacob. <br />

                                    <br /> "Mmm..." Hien purrs. "This is the best one."<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> The color palette of this cowboy review comic is dusty, with dark maroons, pinks, pale yellows, white and black. It's got a noisy gritty layer treatment, lending itself to feeling from another era. The characters in todays comic are the following; <br /> -'Ripley', the author is a nonbinary person wearing a black cowboy hat, glasses, shaggy purple hair, a sleeveless black denim jacket, fingerless gloves, and a yellow kerchief around their neck. They bare their chest often in the comic, showing their top surgery scars. They also have a smattering of facial and belly hairs. <br /> -Another character, 'Cowpoke', wears a black cowboy hat and glasses, but sports a blond beard and mustache, earlobes gauged with modestly-sized black plugs, a purple collared shirt with the classic cowboy designs across the front, and a bolo tie. They have a pale complexion. <br /> -'Bar Patron' is a person of color who wears black dreadlocks pulled back into a loose bun with locks hanging over their shoulders and down their back. They wear a white blouse, dark purple floor-length skirt, and a yellow kerchief hung loosely over their shoulders. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> The backlit silhouette of Ripley enters the double swinging doors of a dusty, somber saloon straight out of the 1800s wild west. <br /> "Afternoon, Ripley!" Cowpoke greats Ripley as they join the table they're sharing with Bar Patron. "...blazes, what happened?"<br /> "Ya look like somethin' the cat dragged!" Chimes in Patron.<br /> "Boy howdy do I have a tale to tell you about the beast I just wrangled." Ripley says as they fan themself briskly with their cowboy hat and pull up a chair. <br />
                                    <br /> "A beast, eh? Was it mean?" Cowpoke asks, intrigued and eager for a good story. <br /> Patron leans in eagerly to ask "Was it ugly?"<br /> "Now hold your horses-" Starts Ripley. <br /> "Did it have three eyes, three toes-" Begins Cowpoke.<br /> "-and a tail longer than the Rio Grande??" Finishes patron. <br /> "...What?" Ripley replaces their hat back on their head. "No! I'm talkin' bout the..."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Cowboy rope, sleek clip-in fasteners on black belts, and tentacles frame a large title, which reads: "Tentacle Grinder III by Uncover Creations, $79 USD" in a classic Old West font. <br />
                                    <br /> The toy is kind of like a small saddle, molded to look like entwined, coiling tentacles complete with suckers. Four straps with buckles emerge from the base. <br />
                                    <br /> Text: Medical grade super soft silicone with multiple finish and firmness options! Nylon-weave straps with buckles. Optional vibrator slot. Around the size of a thick paper-back book. More silicone and strap colors than you can shake a stick at! <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley holds the tentacle object in one hand while gesturing at it with the other as they explain, "This grinder is unlike anything I've ever seen in my time in the sexy west. I was looking for DIFFERENT, and boy did I find it! Uncover Creations breaks the mold with their grinders, and they do it in style: werewolves, tentacles, alien's, dragons... their whole theme is MONSTERS!" <br /> "That's one fancy do-hickey." Cowpoke ads. <br /> "How's it work?" Asks Patron. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: You just hitch it to any object of your choice with the two included belts. (I strapped mine to a rolled-up yoga mat, on top of a few supporting pillows.)<br />
                                    <br /> "Ol' Ripley's got fragile knees and hips" Bemoans Ripley. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Slick it up real nice with your favorite water-based lube and when it's good n' secure, saddle up and get ridin'!<br />
                                    <br /> In silhouette, we see a figure in cowboy boots and hat in hand riding an enormous horse-sized tentacle.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> "Sakes alive," Patron chimes in, looking hungrily at the sample image of Cowpoke straddling and grinding on the toy as it's strapped to a rolled-up yoga mat. "what a messy situation!" Cowpoke's top surgery scars are visible and they genitals produce "SKWISH SLIK SLIK SLIK" noises as they rub against the grinder. They keep their hat, bolo tie, glasses, and boots on as they ride this toy. <br />
                                    <br /> "Darn tootin' it is," Responds Ripley proudly. "an' that's one of the best parts! Once you get going it starts sounding nasty as all hell." <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Grindin' back and forth, you get a broad experience as your entire pelvic area squishes against it. It can be quite a workout! Half of my enjoyment came just from getting my heart rate up.<br /> "Blazes!" Exclaims a tuckered out Cowpoke. <br /> "But wait, there's more!" Ripley adds, discreetly clicking a remote control. <br />
                                    <br /> Cowpoke is jolted to attention as their yoga-mat-grinder steeds electrifies them with a BZZZZZZZZT.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Stick a bullet in the (optional) vibe hole- preferably with a remote- and now you've got an electric rodeo!<br />
                                    <br /> "Boy howdy!" Exclaims Patron in delight as they check on the thoroughly zonked out Cowpoke. "What a unique ride."<br />
                                    <br /> "Sure is!" Ripley agrees. "It's got plenty of potential for foreplay, paired with penetration, scenes..." <br />
                                    <br /> In the background we see some potential ways the grinder could be used, with different couples. <br /> One person sits on the lap of their partner, where we presume the toy is strapped over the groin area. The bottom partner has a knee brace, implying that the toy helps supplement their performance in bed if they have restricted mobility. <br />
                                    <br /> Another person is shown bound to an old west fence, sitting on the grinder while their partner kneels over them, pressing their thumb into the bound partner's mouth. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> page 4<br /> Looking mournfully to the sky as they wipe away a tear and holding their hat against their chest, Ripley continues, "All of that being said, and because you gotta focus on moving just to maintain those sweet sensations... I never properly orgasmed with this beast. If you need really pin-pointed stimulation on specific parts, you ain't gonna find it here." <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It also requires a lot of fuss to find the right setup and any adjustment means you gotta dismount, fiddle, and get back on to see if it worked. It's hard to find that sweet spot and, for solo play, that's just far too much work for me. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: My vibrator happens to have a remote that made it all the better to adjust the intensity as I went. But the inbuilt space for the vibrator was kind of a dud. <br />
                                    <br /> An arrow points with one arrow to the middle lower section of the grinder with the caption, "Where it is." Another arrow points to the middle top section saying, "Where I want it!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: You just can't feel it where you wanna feel it. <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley now stands with one foot mounted on a chair, in the classic Riker stance, as they point to a bruise on the elevated leg, explaining, "The vibrator bruised me when I wore it on my thigh, too! It was a great ride for my partner but a major ouch for me." <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Speaking of thighs, my final gripe was that the straps seemed really short and the buckles would slide right off. Nobody wants to be chasing down a rogue buckle when they're trying to get their grind on.<br />
                                    <br /> A silhouette shows Cowpoke chasing after an escaping buckle. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> "All in all, there's a lot of creative potential here." Ripley says while lecherously offering the grinder to a blushing and giggling volunteer who has their wrists bound with rope. "But I think for me this bronco is best shared with a favorite partner-in-crime."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It's an opening act, not the main event- but a bit of fun to get the juices flowing. Uncover's customization options add to the value here: Gorgeous colors, different silicone treatments, and each one is hand poured. For $78-100, I'd say it's worth it for someone looking to add a new fancy saddle to their stable. <br />
                                    <br /> A juiced-up nude Ripley reclines next to their freshly-ridden grinder that is still strapped to the rolled-up yoga mat. "Now that I'm warmed up..." they think to themself, while admiring a fantastical creature dildo in their hand. "(Check out their dildo collection!)" advises a helpful note next to it. <br />
                                    <br /> Now back in the bar scene, Ripley sits on the shared table, hoisting the grinder aloft by its straps, and asks, "Now... who wants to go for a ride?"<br /> "Ooh! Me me me!" Exclaims Patron as they jump to their feet. <br /> "Buster, I was born to ride" smirks Cowpoke as they look confidently on at the dangling toy. <br />

                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> "Just a moment, ..." The elf struggles while pulling off their t-shirt, revealing a gray sports sports bra and boxers as the human flirtatiously suspends her pink bra on her extended finger. <br />

                                    <br /> As the human pulls the shirt up and past the elf's head, her hand brushes a pointed ear, eliciting an "Oh~!" from the blushing elf. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> Patting the gray-green sheets on the bed, the human asks, "Lie down for me?" and the elf acquiesces, laying down on her front and peeking back over her shoulder smittenly as the human continues to caress her ear. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br />

The elf pulls her box shorts down, allowing the human hand to stroke and caress their vulva, while continuing to play with her ear. <br /> "Perfect" Purrs a very satisfied elf. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today's sexy comic is made by Starshine! The comic is drawn beautifully in pastels and shows a medieval jousting competition. Taking part is a woman knight called Nor, she is lightly tanned, tall, blue eyed, with long grey haired and wears a silver-blue full bodied armor. Her partner for the comic is a purple dressed Maiden called Idalia, a paler shorter woman with orange eyes and red flowing hair, kept in check beneath a simple ringed crown. Both women and Cis with she/her pronouns. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> The comic starts as a parade of knights ride their horses into the Medieval jousting arena. One red-headed maiden waves her scarf from the royal viewing platform. <br />
                                    <br /> "Nor!" Calls Idalia, waving her scarf to catch the eye of a silver-haired knight. <br /> "I can't believe you rode right past me without taking my favor." Chides Idalia as she ties her maroon scarf to Nor's armored right arm. <br /> "I thought you wanted to keep this private." Nor replies demurely. <br /> "I changed my mind." Idalia says while leaning in to whisper slyly, "Don't get lanced."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> A montage unfolds showing Nor facing off against various competitors and besting them all in with their lance. <br />
                                    <br /> "Well done, my champion!" Congratulates Idalia as she crowns a golden laurel atop Nor's head as she kneel before her. <br />
                                    <br /> Idalia concludes with a kiss to Nor's temple and whispers, "See you tonight."<br />
                                    <br /> Now nighttime, Nor's horse casually grazes outside their tent. A voice commands, "Raise your arms!" and another replies, "Haha!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Inside the tent we see a fully dressed Idalia closely inspecting a nude Nor's torso. <br /> With their head still crowned by the winning laurel, Nor keeps their arms in the air per Idalia's command while teasingly commenting, "You were watching the whole time! You know there isn't a scratch on me." <br />
                                    <br /> "Good girl." Idalia coos while leaning in to kiss the champion's breast. "I'm glad I don't need to have anyone arrested."<br />
                                    <br /> "Lancing you- " Teases Idalia as she raises her skirt to reveal a handsome strap-on secured between her legs, complete with an etching of a knight galloping on their horse, lance pointing towards the tip of her cock. " -is my privilege alone."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> The two kiss passionately as Nor peels Idalia out of her dress. The two tumble backwards. <br /> "where are you going?" Nor asks as Idalia works her way down between their legs. <br /> "Patience, my dear knight." She coos just above Nor's silver-haired mons. "We must prepare -" Idalia takes a moment to gaze on Nor's genitalia. " -before entering the Lists." She concludes with a gentle lick down the center of Nor's lips. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> "Oh! Ah! Idalia, please!" Exclaims Nor as Idalia works away with her mouth between Nor's legs. <br /> Surfacing for air and with her chin covered in juices, Idalia purrs, "Now..."<br /> She guides the tip of her strap-on between Nor's legs, announcing, "We joust!" with a gentle thrust. <br /> "Ah!" Gasps Nor, back arching as her red-headed lover fucks away at her with cool confidence. "Ah! Ah! Ah! AHHhnn!"<br />
                                    <br /> After their private tournament has concluded and the two have recovered, Nor places her golden laurel atop Idalia's head, telling her, "For besting me with a lance."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Todays wonderful comic was made by Starshine<br /> It was then transcribed by the team on 6/3/24! It was only made possible with Patreon support: come and be a part of what we do on https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy<br />

                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> "Ready?" Asks a voice from off screen. "Three, two, one, and go!" <br />
                                    <br /> Hien's anthropomorphic brown bear hand taps down onto the timer on a phone with a beep! The time reads 01:30:00<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I've wanted to try edging for the longest time! On paper, it's everything that I enjoy: sensual intimacy, space for it to be kinky, and I get to touch a penis to my heart's content!<br />
                                    <br /> Garrett, an anthropomorphic gray canine with a shock of red hair, reclines on a teal couch with a yellow padded sleeping mask covering their eyes. Hien delicately runs a finger over the side of Garrett's maw. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien presses his hand in to the furry tummy of Garrett, giving it a good scritch before working down to Garrett's underwear, pulling aside the fabric to reveal a hardening intact (uncircumcised) pink cock against a dark gray ball sack. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But... I don't have the greatest attention span... how would I cope with the time investment inherent to edging?<br />
                                    <br /> We now see that Garrett is tied at the wrists overhead to a nearby coffee table while laying on their back. Their legs are also decoratively bound individually with shibari rope. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Will I get just as much pleasure out of it as the friend I'm pleasuring? Will this be a tool worth adding to my sex toolkit? <br />
                                    <br /> "Ah!" Garrett gasps as Hien delicately holds their cock between their fingers. Hien sticks out his tongue teasingly while also blushing. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Well! No time like the present to find out! <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /> A pink banner obscures part of the page with the text, "Read the rest on ohjoysextoy.com"<br /> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Caption: The Butter Churn<br /> Hien's hands pump straight up and down over Garrett's cock.<br /> "Ah!" responds Garrett.<br />
                                    <br /> Caption: The Accordion<br /> Hien grabs the cock shaft below the balls, so the balls sit smooshed over the top edge of their hand. Hien's other hand clamps down on the cock head. Rthymically, they slide their hands together and then apart, meeting in the middle of the cock. <br /> "Wah!" Gasps Garrett.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: There's a rhythm to edging in which you climb steadily toward a climax, then you back away. I wasn't entirely sure how to fill the down time between each climb...<br />
                                    <br /> Hien leans down to teasingly lick the head of Garrett's dick, which illicits an "Mmmm..." response. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Turned out: it was the perfect space to touch the rest of his body!<br />
                                    <br /> Hien squeezes Garrett's pecs and nuzzles up to their bound leg. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Touching turned to cuddling, turned to stroking, turned to touching-cuddling-stroking...<br />
                                    <br /> Between Garrett's legs, Hien indulgently licks their tummy. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The ebbs and flows kept my infamously busy mind engaged and my touch-starved hands well-sated. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Caption: The "Ponder My Orb"<br /> Hien's left hand holds Garrett's cock at its base, while the right hand makes a fist around the head and swivels in a circular direction. <br /> "Aaahh~!" moans Garrett. <br />
                                    <br /> Caption: The GirlBoss<br /> With his free hand, Hien disinterestedly taps out "I hope this email find you well..." on his phone while he continues to jerk off Garrett. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Every time I shafted him short of a climax.. I could feel his heart beat in the throbs of his penis. <br />
                                    <br /> In Hien's still fist, Garrett's cock pulses to a "ba-bump ba-bump" beat. Hien looks on with love in his eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> "H-Hien!" Garrett calls out, hands still bound and eyes still covered with a blindfold. <br /> "You're so cute!!" Hien coos as he nestles up against Garrett's fuzzy chest. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It's incredible that I get to spend time like this with the people I love. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narration: You know, I often find myself not caring too much about getting off at all during sex. <br />
                                    <br /> On the coffee table we see a box of tissue, a remote control, a bottle of some beverage, a mug, a bottle of lube, and a few bundles of shibari rope. From off screen we hear Garrett's "A-ah..."<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: If I wanted to come, I could always jerk off on my own afterward!<br />
                                    <br /> On the teal couch we see Garrett's various items of clothes, accompanied by a "Hng..." from him out of view. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The pleasure I want from sexual intimacy is the intimacy itself. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Every honeyed moan...<br /> Hien's ear pricks up as Garrett moans an "Ah!"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Every uncontrollable shiver...<br />
                                    <br /> Hien waggles a finger back and forth like a metronome across the frenulum (the line that connects from the shaft of the cock to the split in the glans), which is labelled "The Frenulum Pendulum"<br />
                                    <br /> "F-fuck..." responds Garrett. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: The scenery of unabashed vulnerability touches me in ways so much more rewarding than touching my own penis. <br />
                                    <br /> Garrett's bound wrists tug and tremble against their ropes. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I feel so indebted to kink and fetish for giving me so many avenues to access intimacy. Being able to facilitate the scratching of these niche itches fulfills me in a way that pole-in the-hole simply does not. <br />
                                    <br /> Panting, Garrett begs, "Can I come? Please?..."<br />
                                    <br /> "Hehe! I don't know~" teases Hien in return. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: What sex is and what sex can be continue to be redefined every time I find a new way to make a body quiver... <br />
                                    <br /> The time now reads 00:02:24 with a STOP and RESET button beneath it. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And I just cannot get enough of it!<br />
                                    <br /> Cracking his knuckles with playfully-sadistic determination, Hien announces, "I'm not ready for this to be over!"<br />
                                    <br /> Hien's hand taps down on the RESET button of the timer, taking it back to 01:30:00.<br />
                                    <br /> "Let's keep going!" Hien crows. "Once more, to the edge!" <br />
                                    <br /> "Aw... Okay...!!" Garrett responds while his hard cock twitches and pulses in anticipation. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Spring Fever by Ripley LaCross is colored with a pink, purple, yellow, white, and black palette. It features a curvy femme person with shoulder-length messy blonde hair who wears a yellow and black-striped halter top and black jean shorts, we'll call her Bea. The other character is a thin masc person with long flowing black hair who wears jeans, a black tshirt, and an unbuttoned purple shirt over it with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows- we'll call him Flùr. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> A big bushy lilac tree is in full bloom and releasing pollen and spores into the air. Nestled in its branches is a bird sitting in their nest with their partner bird touching beaks with them. Bees and various particles drift through the air in a breeze, right past the open window in a pretty house that also has flowering gardening troughs(? Sorry, I don't remember the word) attached on the outside sill. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Spring has sprung and LOVE is in the air. <br />
                                    <br /> Now on the other side of the open window, we see a couple is lounging on a couch, playing on their phones. Their faces are mildly flushed across the cheeks and nose, and they sniffle intermittently. Crumpled up tissues litter the coffee table in front of them. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But much to the dismay of these two lovebirds-<br />
                                    <br /> Bea SNORFs loudly, failing to restrain the snot escaping from her nostrils. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: -So is the pollen of every tree, grass, and flower. No matter.<br />
                                    <br /> "Hey." Flùr says flirtatiously with little hearts popping around his word balloon. He gestures at the fresh bulge blooming in his pants. A bouquet of flowers and hearts wreaths his head, in case you didn't pick up that he feels AMOROUS.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Seasonal allergies are no match for the instinctual desire to MATE.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /> A pink banner obscures part of the page with the text, "Read the rest on ohjoysextoy.com"<br /> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> page 2<br /> Narration: Like a thoughtfully choreographed dance, the suitor makes his move. <br />
                                    <br /> Flùr grabs his bulge, with more symbolically-horny flowers blossoming up on either side. He bites his lip as his own running nose snot flows freely towards his seductive mouth.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Cooing and purring his mating call, he makes a show of his impressive visage. <br />
                                    <br /> Flùr begins to pucker, looking angelically beautiful in-spite of the two snot streams curving around either side of his lips. Flowers continue to bloom around him. <br />
                                    <br /> A wet, gooey "HOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!!" fills the air as Bea sits upright, eyes squinched shut either from being startled or from allergies or both. <br />
                                    <br /> Continuing to look at Bea seductively, Flùr proffers the snotty, used tissue he just filled with the contents of his nose. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Will his beloved accept?<br />
                                    <br /> Without moving any other muscle, Flùr breaks into a giant shit-eating grin as Bea's panties slam into his face with a WAP!<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: SUCCESS. Today is a good day.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> Bleeding hearts and irises drape over the panel border as Bea clambers atop Flùr, her bare ass and a hint of vulva exposed to us. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: There are, of course, still allergies to content with. But luckily for these two...<br />
                                    <br /> From under the couch, we see Bea's hand searching among the forgotten couch detritus including a mug, pen, papers, mail, a remote control, and then finally landing on a fresh box of tissue.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: They prepared well in advance. <br />
                                    <br /> Pulling her striped shirt up high enough to show some nipple. "Woulb you still lub me ib I were a walbrus? (Would you still love me if I were a walrus?)" she asks, with each drippy nostril plugged with a twisted stick of tissue protruding from them like a handlebar mustache. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Using mimicry, she tests the strength of their bond. The strategy, though unconventional, appears to be effective.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> "..." With genuine devotion in his eyes, Flùr answers, "...puck, you'd be a SEXY walbrus. (Fuck, you'd be a sexy walrus)"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narration: There's no time to waste.<br />
                                    <br /> A field of flowers erupts around the fucking couple. <br /> Petals and pollen and bees drift by lazily overhead <br /> while Flùr guides Bea's hips to sit down on his juicy <br /> shlonger. They gasp and groan both in pleasure and <br /> from allergies.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Fluctuating hormones and schedule mean that 'next time' could be days or even weeks away. <br />
                                    <br /> Cupping Bea's face (which still has the snot sticks in each nostril), Flùr coos, "I lub you so mush... (I love you so much)"<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But that doesn't mean there's not time for flattery.<br />
                                    <br /> "Gob, your eyes are so priddy... (God, your eyes are so pretty)" Bea coos back, her own eyes puffy and discolored from the allergies wrecking havoc on her face. Her nose is bright red and swollen from the volume of snot escaping from her nostrils, inspite of the twisted sticks of tissue that she's wedged up in them to prevent exactly that from happening. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hha..." Bea moans again, but it's not exactly from pleasure. "AH-" Her head jerks back as her sinuses take over. "CHOO! AH-CHOO!!" she sneezes forcefully, spasming all of her muscles, including her pussy as it clenches down with superhuman strength on Flùr's thrusting thingus. "Oh yeah! Oh gob-! Jus like that-! I'm gonna, ah... Nng- AH-" He choruses back to her. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The coupling reaches a dramatic climax with an operatic "AH- CHOO!!" and they fall backwards to their respective sides of their now-goopy couch. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: ...And as quickly as it began, it's over. Yet another mating ritual come and gone with the wind. Our two lovebirds, now spent, will groom and begin their daily hunt for lunch." <br />
                                    <br /> "Is this lube? Or..." Asks Bea, examining a substance on her hand. <br /> "...Let's just assume it's lube..." Flùr answers groggily, splayed out on the couch. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: If they can muster the energy, anyway."<br /> "...I want tacos." Bea announces, sitting upright, as Flùr begins to snore. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> Imaginary Dom by Rhu * https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/imaginary-dom-rhu<br />
                                    <br /> Rhu is self described as; transmasc, a small/feminine/twink trans guy with a small pre-op chest, and messy blond hair.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I have always been curious about kink and BDSM.<br /> IMAGE: Wearing a t-shirt, Rhu pantomimes asking his partners about kink and BDSM, with his partners pantomiming their disinterest.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: However, non of my partners shared that interest with me. <br /> IMAGE: At a kinky dungeon scene, Rhu stands awkwardly in the center, looking at all the other people getting spanked and tied up and collared. He wears a short black dress and thigh-high black boots. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Having an open relationship meant I could look for play partners elsewhere but I had little luck. <br /> IMAGE: Rhu, back in his t-shirt from before, sits hunched over a table with his head in his hands, reading messages popping up out of his laptop screen. The messages say, "Hey, sexy!", "Wanna meet?" and a bunch of word balloons containing only a red flag. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And then...<br /> "Why is my body like thiiiiis....?" Rhu bemoans, head in hands, as little blue-pink-white trans flags and cracking eggs fill up the air around him.<br /> Narration: ...things got even more complicated when I realized I wasn't exactly cisgender.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Narration: You'd think finding a play partner would be easy enough.<br /> Image: Rhu, now dressed in a baggy brown hoody, slumps at their table, scrolling through their options on the laptop as red flag after red flag pops up from his screen. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: But no one I talked to seemed to be the right fit. <br /> Image: Rhu casually glances at a box of sex toys that are just barely visible in the frame now. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: That was when I had an idea..."<br /> Image: Rhu remains in exactly the same position, eyes cast at the box of toys, but now he smiles mischievously as a little floating lightbulb lights up over his head. <br />
                                    <br /> Image: Rhu lifts up his hoody, exposing his small pre-op chest. He bites his lip as he closes a clothespin-like clamp down onto his nipple and then giving it a tentative tug.<br /> Narration: There was nothing stopping me from trying things on my own. And so I started incorporating a little of the spice I was missing in my self-love sessions. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Image: We see a montage of a fully nude Rhu trying out various BDSM practices. <br /> "Over here, under there..." He says aloud to himself as he ties a rope harness behind his back. <br /> "Oh..." He says inquisitively as he taps a cane against his bare ass. "Okay like that." <br /> With a ball bag in his month and a leather collar on his neck, he ties a blindfold over his eyes. <br />
                                    <br /> Finally he sighs as he flomps in defeat onto the floor, surrounded by a dildo, rope, ball gag, vibrator, and butt plug. <br /> Narration: I still felt like I was missing out on something though. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narration: I wanted a Dom because I wanted the role play. <br /> Image: Rhu sits upright, using a vibrator between his legs and looking dissatisfied. <br />
                                    <br /> Imaginary voice: Turn it up a bit for me. <br /> Image: An imaginary arm extends into the scene, lifting up Rhu's chin. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And role play was just a matter of immersing myself in a fantasy. <br /> "Just a little longer" The imaginary person says as they pull Rhu's head upwards by the hair and wrap an imaginary hand around his neck. <br />
                                    <br /> "Good boy." The imaginary Dom says with a pat on Rhu's head as he catches his breath and pulls away the vibrator. <br /> Narration: Why not make up a fantasy Dom, then?<br />
                                    <br /> A handsome masculine Dom stares us down with their arms folded. They have a shaggy brunette mop of bags, thick eyebrows, and wear a black button-down collared shirt, belt, and jeans. <br /> "Going out?" The Dom asks while Rhu lustily looks a the coil of rope in his hands. "Wear this so you know what awaits you after." Rhu ties the rope into a harness around his chest. "Here, if you want to earn a reward later." Rhu smiles naughtily at the silver butt plug in his hand.<br /> Narration: With an imaginary Dom I didn't have to wait until I found a partner I trusted to practice BDSM with. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Narration: My Dom felt like a safe test run.<br /> Image: A fully nude Rhu sits down onto a dildo that is standing upright on the floor. <br />
                                    <br /> "Good boy." The Dom says while standing behind Rhu, resting a hand on his shoulder and the top of his head reassuringly once he's sat all the way down on the dildo. <br /> Narration: I wasn't beholden to anyone. <br />
                                    <br /> The Dom pulls Rhu's head back, asking "Aren't you loud?", as he pants and groans. <br /> Image: Rhu reaches behind himself, towards a ball gag. The Dom is not there. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Everything I did was on my terms and my terms alone."<br /> Image: The Dom re-materializes behind Rhu again, securing the ball gag behind his head as Rhu's hands do the same. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: And the bonus? He always wanted exactly what I wanted. <br /> Image: The Dom crouches behind the kneeling Rhu (dildo solidly inserted into him), wrapping his hand over Rhu's own hands that are gripping his neck and pressed over his genitals.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I still hope I will find a real Dom one day, but till then I am perfectly content with my imaginary Dom. <br /> Image: Sitting on the ground with the dildo and ball gag removed, Rhu wraps his arms around himself while his Imaginary Dom overlays his arms over Rhu's, while also straddling the naked Rhu between his legs. Rhu looks at peace and content. <br />

                        <br /> As fans of John Oliver’s show for a decade now, it would be an understatement to say that we were stunned to discover our work on screen next to him. There <em>may</em> have been some tears while hearing him defend our work, but I’ll never admit it. (There were. There were tears.) It means so much to see him going to bat not just for our book, but fellow graphic novel <a href="https://redgoldsparkspress.com/projects/6926504">
                            <em>Gender Queer</em> by Maia Kobabe</a> as well. <p />
                        <p>Thank you to John Oliver for making us laugh all these years and for keeping us informed of the nuance in complicated matters. Even more, thank you to the dedicated librarians who are working so hard to serve their communities even when it is a battle. We appreciate you. We owe you a coffee. Or ten. </p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> Today's autobiographical comic is about Clar Hart. They are self described at nonbinary with they/them pronouns. Visually, they're a plump, stubby redhead with a lavender shirt.<br />
                                    <br /> Standing at a giant open treasure chest piled high with books, Clar says in surprise, "You won this? A whole treasure chest of romance books?" <br />
                                    <br /> Their friend is draped over a couch, reading a book. "Yeah, want one?"<br />
                                    <br /> "I couldn't." Clar says, though clearly they are wrestling with this decision. <br />
                                    <br /> "Suit yourself." Their friend says as they put on their backpack and leave. <br />
                                    <br /> Clar waits for their friend to leave and then nervously tucks one of the books into their own backpack. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Nervously, Clar zips out with their prized book buried in their backpack. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Romance books were out, and proud of it. <br /> Image: a spread of sexy book covers featuring an assortment of couples and singles in revealing clothing. <br />
                                    <br /> "Whatchya reading?" the friend from before asks Clar, who anxiously replies, "Nothing!" as they reveal to the viewer that they are reading their romance novel which is hidden behind their math book. <br /> Narration: I... wasn't.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I was following the only path I knew, not knowing there could be others.<br /> While walking hand-in-hand with a companion, Clar looks back over their shoulder at another couple holding hands and walking in the opposite direction.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Narration: It was only during the pandemic that I started to ask myself: in a world where the impossibly bad had become commonplace, why couldn't I believe in impossibly good? <br />
                                    <br /> The viewer is shown the outside of a grey apartment building with silhouettes of people separated from each other in their windows. Clar sits inside their grey apartment on their grey couch, cocooned in a grey-blue blanket and looking terrified. They look at their green backpack leaning against the couch before reaching inside to pull out the vibrantly colored romance book they had stolen earlier. It features two people with lots cleavage and sparkly flowing princess dresses who are holding hands. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Across a rainbow montage a variety of couples in all different skin tones and gender combinations happily post with each other, hearts radiating around them. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Rugby players date professors. Cover models marry booksellers. Princes fall in love with presents' sons. <br />
                                    <br /> Reclining on their now-rainbowed colored couch and surrounded by piles of brightly-colored books, Clar reads vibrant book with a smile. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Maybe a little escapism could take me exactly where I need to go. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Outside in the fresh air Clar walks on grass quite happily, hugging a romance book to their chest. They're wearing a different hair cut and time seems to have passed. <br />
                                    <br /> While sitting on a bus and reading, a person with long red hair and wearing a blue shirt sits next to them, eyeing the book in Clar's hands. <br /> "Whatchya reading?" the new person asks. <br /> "It's so good!" Exclaims Clar. "There's this-"<br />
                                    <br /> A montage ensues, showing these two across different scenes. They talk about their respective romance books, they get drinks at a coffee shop, they tentatively holds hands. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Romance books helped me find myself and let myself be found...<br />
                                    <br /> "I have something I think you'll enjoy." Clar says lustily while embracing their companion who looks back at them flirtatiously. <br />
                                    <br /> Together they sit by the original treasure chest of romance books, both of them surrounded by stacks of books and happily curled up with their own respective books. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: ...and create treasures of our own. <br />

                        <br /> As fans of John Oliver’s show for a decade now, it would be an understatement to say that we were stunned to discover our work on screen next to him. There <em>may</em> have been some tears while hearing him defend our work, but I’ll never admit it. (There were. There were tears.) It means so much to see him going to bat not just for our book, but fellow graphic novel <a href="https://redgoldsparkspress.com/projects/6926504">
                            <em>Gender Queer</em> by Maia Kobabe</a> as well. <p />
                        <p>Thank you to John Oliver for making us laugh all these years and for keeping us informed of the nuance in complicated matters. Even more, thank you to the dedicated librarians who are working so hard to serve their communities even when it is a battle. We appreciate you. We owe you a coffee. Or ten. </p>

                                <strong>Hien’s Blog Notes!</strong>
                                <br /> Thank you to my wonderful friend Chris not only for starring in this comic, but also for braving this brand-new world with me! Thank you to Nick and Jacob for your help with some photo references as well! And thank you to my editor Ziggy for helping me find the shape of this story that’s been ruminating in my head since last year! Finally, thank you all for reading! I hope you’ve learned something new, or if you end up finding the stricter depiction more appealing… well, that’s definitely not unintentional ;)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Finally, a huge thank you to all of you who’ve chipped in this past month. Truly. We’ll be diving in after we get out final numbers, and making plans and decisions accordingly. But each and every one of you who’ve signed up has meant the world to me and the team. I think these comics are important and apparently you do too, thank you.</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Hien Pham lushly illustrates this comic in a somewhat realistic rendering and in red and purple hues. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Hien and his companion sit on a bench against the wall of a sex dungeon. They are mostly nude, except for the towels over their laps, so their hairy chests and bellies are exposed. They also both wear glasses and have beards. Towels, sex tools, and informational posters hang on the wall, while a heavy duty chain hangs in the foreground, supporting some kind of sex support equipment. Also in the foreground is a couple. We can see one hairy chest and belly wearing an open vest (Dom), hand on the head of the partner (Sub) who is kneeling in front of them with an eye-mask on. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I've gotten to do a fair bit of Shibari recently, and in a surprising turn of events, I'm finding myself growing into somewhat of a Dom. <br /> "Did I... do okay?" Hien asks his friend. <br /> "You did great!" His friend says, pulling Hien in close for a side-hug. <br /> "Yay!!" Smiles Hien.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Surprising because... I was never sure if I really fit into the stereotypical Dom/Sub image.<br />
                                    <br /> The friend loops his arm over Hien's shoulder as they continue to sit, while in the foreground we see the couple from the first panel again. We can now see that the kneeling, masked person also has a collar and leash around their neck, and the standing person a firm, gloved hand on the back of their head, holding them in place. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I never liked the feeling of being punished, or having to dish out punishment. Absolute "obedience" rubs me the wrong way. The power exchange seemed all to intense to take on. <br />
                                    <br /> We see the top left quadrant of Hien's companion's chest, showing off tracks of rope marks left on his skin. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Still, I wanted to be someone who could enable my partners' pleasure and desire, and that meant taking the reins in a way comfortable to me. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Narration: When we talk about Domination, there's a prevalent image that comes to mind, right? <br />
                                    <br /> Image: Dom holds Sub's cheeks with one gloved hand while gently letting their drool pool into Sub's open mouth. Dom's heavy chain and padlock hang around their neck.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: A Dom is given control by their Sub, and uses it to deal pleasure and pain in mutually agreed-upon measures. Your mind and body are utterly surrendered to someone who holds the key to your every desire in their hands. The fantasy is often driven further with titilating scenarios of desperation, humiliation and even degradation. <br />
                                    <br /> Image: Hien stands behind his companion, who is wearing a rope harness over their chest. Hien caresses his partner's shoulder and nuzzles into the person's back. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: A soft approach to Domination offers the same pleasure, but with a focus on care, and affection. In place of punishments, there could be positive reinforcement making use of praise and reassurance throughout a scene. The full submission fantasy gives way to a more levelled power balance. Consent is repeatedly asked for, reaffirmed, and reiterated. All Dom/Sub dynamics require care and consent, but they're more central and immediately visible in a gentle approach. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> "I'm gunna fuck you and pass you around until you can't take even one more load." The Dom informs their sub, who is kneeling barefoot and ankle-cuff bound between the Dom's boots. <br /> "Yes, sir. My hole is yours, sir..." The Sub replies, barely quivering. <br /> "Good boy." Says the Dom. <br />
                                    <br /> "Want me to open the door?" Hien asks his standing rope-harnessed partner. "Or would you like to play a bit first?"<br /> "Um... I haven't thought about it..." Replies his companion, a little timidly. <br /> "That's alright!" Hien reassures him with a hand gently on this bound arm. "How about... we leave it open a crack while I warm you up with a flogger?<br />
                                    <br /> "This is MY dick, now." Growls the Dom as he aggressively jerks off the Sub. "Don't come, boy, or I'll lube up your ass with your own cum and fuck it AGAIN."<br /> "Sir!! Please!! I... I-I'm gonna-" Grimaces the Sub. <br />
                                    <br /> "How are you feeling?" Hien asks, hand pausing between spanks on his companion's bent-over bottom. "Ten more and you'll get a kiss~"<br /> "I'm good! Let's do fifteen and you slip some tongue in there?" Suggests the companion, thighs quivery lightly in their rope harness. <br /> "Haha! If you moan loud enough!" Agrees Hien. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narration: To me, as a learning Dom, the gentler approach feels a lot less daunting. I still get that fulfilment from taking care of someone, but I don't have to make every single decision on my own. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: One of my favourite things is presenting my partner a limited number of options to continue a scene. <br /> Image: Hien offers a water bottle in one hand and a bundle of rope in the other. <br />
                                    <br /> Image: His companion drinks gratefully from the bottle that Hien holds for him. <br /> Narration: I still take charge by picking out those choices, but by asking my partner to choose, I also get to let up on the reins. <br />
                                    <br /> Image: His companion rests his head in the crook between Hien's neck and shoulder, taking a moment to relax. <br /> Narration: For a brief moment, I can take a breath, and my partner calms my mind by reaffirming what they want. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: This approach feels almost collaborative in that way. Even though I have my hands on the controls, the scene is co-piloted by the both of us. <br /> Image: Hien interlocks his fingers with his companion's, while their hands are bound behind their back in an elaborate rope harness. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Image: Both sets of couples are now free-falling happily through the air. <br /> Narration: A Dom/Sub power exchange is a nuanced, constant conversation and flexible sliding scale. In any given scene, the dichotomy of hard and soft go hand-in-hand and flow from one to another. Tenderness hits that much harder peppered with an otherwise intense series of events. <br />
                                    <br /> Over an illustration of a heavy chain, a rope, and a leather strap, the narration reads: A gentle hand can dish out just as much pain as a punishing one. An affectionate reassurance and a devilish demand can make you quiver just the same.<br />
                                    <br /> "My own approach to soft Domination is ever-evolving, and won't be the same as anyone else's!" Hien addresses the reader after his session with his companion has concluded. He wears the former rope harness looped loosely around his heck and chest while he affectionately hugs his companion, who sits between his legs. "Talk to your play partners and see how you feel! The most important thing is communication! After all, I might like my Dom soft, but only you can decide what your pleasure is made of!"<br />
                                    <br /> ---<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> A Handy Guide to Fisting by Ripley LaCross is drawn in a very simple, cartoon-y style, emulating the Muppets. The color scheme is pastel pinks and blues, maroon, black, and white. Murray is a pink human-ish puppet wearing a collared maroon shirt. They have book ping-pong-like eyeballs, no nose, and three tubular "hairs" on top of their head. Kurt is a white puppet with a big pink nose, a mop of short pink hair, and wears a pink long-sleeve shirt, black pants, and maroon shoes. <br />
                                    <br /> Kurt and Murray sit on a brick wall, holding hands. <br /> Murray: Kurt, my love, I must confess something. <br /> Kurt: Yes, my darling Murray, anything! <br />
                                    <br /> The camera zooms in close to Murray whispering into Kurt's ear, "I want... to try *fisting*"<br /> "GASP!!" Gasps Murray. "Fisting! So bold! So daring! But won't it hurt?"<br /> "It's not supposed to!" Murray explains, procuring a brochure titled FISTING from nowhere. "Look here, I found this *hand* guide to help us!"<br /> "Okay Murray!" Kurt says, while looking over the brochure. "If this is that important to you, we'll give it a go!"<br /> Murray flails his arms in joy, exclaiming "YaAaAAaY!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> A page from the brochure reads "F is for FONDLE! Your opening is like an elastic band, capable of stretching to great sizes! But a cold or dry band SNAPS! Star slow and take your time! Relax! Enjoy the ride!" A series of simply illustrations shows the progression of a hand holding up one finger, two fingers, three fingers, and then all the fingers upright and kind of squished/overlapping, with the thumb tucking up along the center of the palm. <br />
                                    <br /> Kurt is held aloft over the brick wall where they were just sitting, reveling that they are a puppet on a human hand- the human's arm extending off the page so we can't see the puppet-master. Murray reclines on their back on the wall, their puppet opening on display with another human hand inserting two fingers into it. <br /> Kurt: So, we gotta warm that baby up!"<br /> Murray: Don't forget the lube!<br />
                                    <br /> The next page of the brochure reads, "I is for INTERCOMMUNICATION! Fisting is a lot to *handle*! Not all ["bodies" is struck out] puppets are capable of accommodoating such girth. Constant communication with your partner is KEY!"<br /> "How are you, darling?" Kurt asks while Murray now has three fingers going into their puppet entrance.<br /> "I'm doing great! But let's go a little slower." Answers Murray in delight. <br />
                                    <br /> An except from the brochure reads, "Check in frequently and inform when another finger is added!"<br /> "This little piggie had fun... and this little piggie went..." Kurt cheers on Murray as the human slides in four fingers. "WEE WEE WEEEE~! All the way in!"<br /> "That's a lot of piggies! I think I'm ready for the whole ham!" Murray enthuses. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> "S is for SLIPPER!" Reads the next brochure page, along with illustrations of lube bottles. "Take however much lube you use normally and double it. Triple it!"<br />
                                    <br /> "One... two... THREE!" Kurt counts as they press the dispenser top on a bottle of lube, filling a human's hand with the slippery liquid. <br /> Murray claps their puppet hands, saying "Great job, Kurt!" and revealing the lube dribbling out of their empty puppet hole while the human hand gets re-lubbed by Kurt. <br />
                                    <br /> "It says here you don't actually make a fist, it's more of a duck." Reads Kurt from the brochure to Murray. <br /> "If it's wearing a condom, does that make it a rubber ducky?" Asks Murray mischievously as the human hand gets three fingers in to them. <br />
                                    <br /> "T is for TIME!" Reads the brochure. "Be patient. Don't rush. Don't force. Just go with the flow!" A diagram of multiple clock faces shows time passing. "Once they're warmed up, lubed, and ready..."<br /> SHLORP sounds the human's hand as it completely slides inside of Murray's puppet entrance. <br /> Blushing and with eyes agog, Murray exclaims, "Oh my fucking god."<br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Murray floats through the cosmos, which are lushly painted- causing a strong contrast against their simple cartoony lines. The energy outline of a human shimmers, showing where their arm would be connecting inside of the puppet. <br /> "I've never been so... FULL!" Marvels Murray as they fly through cosmic beauty. "It feels right. I feel WHOLE!"<br />
                                    <br /> Murray's hand rests on top of Kurt's as they say, "The world is a beautiful thing and I feel so, so, so close to you, Kurt."<br /> "Oh darling..." Coos Kurt with stars twinkling in the background. <br />
                                    <br /> Murray take Kurt's hand in both of theirs. Dripping with sweat and looking intensely into Kurt's eyes, Murray declares, "This is, truly, the first time I've allowed myself to be so open and trusting with another puppet... Kurt... I-"<br />
                                    <br /> "Experiment with rocking, rolling, and rotating your hand to hit their good spots!" Encourages a snippet of the brochure. <br />
                                    <br /> "WAHHH!!!!!!" In silhouette we see Murray- with hand firmly jammed all the way up in there so none of it visible from the outside- flailing their puppet limbs in unbridled ecstatic release. They are haloed by hearts and sweat drops. <br />
                                    <br /> "Darling!" Now back in reality, Kurt checks on Murray. "Is it too much?" <br /> With sweat drops, blushing, squiggly marks, and bubbles of disorientation floating around them, Murray replies, "H-holy shit, no it's fucking amazing."<br />
                                    <br /> Murray pounces on Kurt in a passionate puppet kiss. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> The brochure lays open with various fluids splashed upon it. It reads, <br /> "When it's time to go, remember F.I.S.T.! <br /> Fondle: Pullet out gently. Massage your partner's outer layers to help. [Illustrations suggest different ways to stroke and massage the labia majora and surrounding area to help it relax.]<br /> Intercommunication: Speak to your partner, listen to their needs.<br /> Slippery: Don't put the lube away yet! Things get even tighter after the climax.<br /> Time: Above all, exit slowly! You're here for a good time, not a quick time. <br /> Congratulations! You've now fisted. Don't forget aftercare. Be gentle and maybe grab an ice pack. Good job!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Locked in a hug (with the puppeteer's arms visible), Murray declares, "Thank you! That was amazing.", to which Kurt replies, "It was my pleasure, darling! Maybe next time I can try it?"<br />
                                    <br /> "Yes! because..." Murray starts and then in unison the two puppets conclude, "Sharing and Caring go HAND-IN-HAND!" The top of the puppeteer's blue hair is partially visible behind the brick wall that the puppets are sitting on. <br />
                                    <br /> Now the puppeteer stands up to reveal themselves to be cartoonist Ripley LaCross! Ripley awkwardly holds the puppets for a beat and then with a look of discomfort asks you, the reader, to "...please don't tell my family about this."<br />
                                    <br /> ---<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today’s comic is drawn by Juliette Taka. It utilizes a strong-edged line work with cartoonish characters and simple, but vibrant backgrounds. It feels easy, friendly, and accessible, while also being full of life, and evocative! Juliette shows herself at different ages, and self-describes for the transcription as such: Kid Juliet is a skinny girl with a pixie haircut and dark hair. Adult Juliet is a a slightly larger but still, short skinny girl with long, dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. She is a flat-chested woman with short dark hair and a petite stature and self-identities with a tomboy appearance. Juliet goes by she/her pronouns.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br />
                                    <br /> The comic starts with Kid Juliette, lying on her back in the living room next to her mother as she reads a newspaper on the couch. Juliette is playing on her Gameboy.<br /> Narration - ‘Until I hit 17, sports had always been a big part of my life. Well, the usual teen sports anyway.’<br />
                                    <br /> Juliette’s mother - ‘Which sport do you want to do this year?’<br />
                                    <br /> Kid Juliette - ‘Pokémon trainer!’<br />
                                    <br /> Juliette’s mother - ‘All right, dance it is!’<br />
                                    <br /> The panel shows us kid Juliette swirling a ribbon in dance practice, wearing a one-piece as she thinks to herself - ‘I feel so awkward…’<br />
                                    <br /> Next, we see Juliette, talking to a teacher on a track and field as other children run past <br /> Kid Juliette - ‘I want to do long jump.’<br />
                                    <br /> Teacher - ‘Too bad. Today is cross-country training.’<br />
                                    <br /> The page ends with Kid Juliette swimming. An instructor shouts from outside of the panel - ‘10 more laps! You are training to win!’<br /> Kid Juliette thinks to herself, mid-stroke - ‘I’d rather be in bed…’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Narration sits on top of the first panel, which contains a pair of swimming goggles all wet and left on the floor.<br /> Narration - ‘I liked to work out – but I couldn’t find anything I loved.’<br />
                                    <br /> Juliette is now, aged up in her adult era, she sits on the couch with her laptop in her lap wearing some stripy pajamas, she scrolls over Instagram and one message pops up.<br /> ‘Kate Sunday, 13th of March <br /> … Pole dancing hurts like hell lmao’<br />
                                    <br /> Juliettepauses her scrolling for a second and thinks to herself - ‘Huh? Why does stripping hurt? Maybe she’s in a bondage club or something? <br />
                                    <br /> She continues to scroll going past hundreds of different people dancing on a pole holding incredible poses, and defying gravity.<br /> Narration - ‘Intrigued, I looked at her posts and watched a lot of pole dance videos…’<br /> Sound effect - ‘Scroll scroll scroll’<br /> Juliette exclaims aloud - ‘Ooo pole Dance!?’<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - ‘… For eight hours straight!’<br /> Sound effect - ‘Scroll, scroll scroll’<br />
                                    <br /> Is now deep in the twilight hours Juliette holds up her laptop in triumph.<br /> Narration - ‘My obsession was born!’<br /> She shouts out loud - ‘All right! I booked a class! Pole dance, here I come!’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> A tentative Juliette peaks her head around a door, looking inward.<br /> Juliette - Er, hi, I’m here for the class…’<br />
                                    <br /> A pole coach hanging off the side of the pole, while maintaining some splits, welcomes Juliette in, she is a tall, flexible woman in her 30s with long auburn hair tied in a messy bun on her head. She’s both curvy and muscular. <br /> Coach - ‘Please come in!’<br /> Juliette looks on with wide eyes - ‘Holy moly! Can you teach me to do this?!’<br /> Coach - ‘Sure. We’ll start with the basics.’<br />
                                    <br /> A Juliette dressed in tight and short sportswear hops onto the pole, doing some very basic spins and gripping it between her legs. <br /> Juliette - ‘This is awesome! I feel free! I feel strong!’<br /> Her eyes are filled with stars - ‘Everything is fun, and I don’t mind the effort!’ <br />
                                    <br /> It’s the end of the session, and Juliette holds her beaten arms up. She’s covered in bruises and scrapes, her hair disheveled, but she wears a big victorious grin. She marches past the Coach. <br /> Juliet - ‘Wow, look at my bruises and pole burns! I’m a warrior!’<br /> Coach - ‘Impressive! See you next week?’<br /> Juliet - ‘You bet!’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> We are shown a wide panel of multiple Juliettes at different times, each on the pole, doing a different pose. Some are elegant others dynamic. The final illustration is of Juliette fresh out of the shower wearing a towel, flexing her muscles, and being impressed by how strong she’s become. Narration - ‘With pole dancing, I experienced overwhelming joys… Choreography! First inversion! Spinning! Feeling stronger! <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: …and painful lows. <br /> We see Juliettedropping from the pole, around her like tendrils are three dark and inky word balloons each one with a negative inside of it; <br /> Injury. Plateauing. Fear of heights. <br />
                                    <br /> Undaunted, Juliette marches back up to the pole, stepping on the black inky balloons from before. She looks determined. <br /> Narration - ‘But I kept going, no matter what! Because I loved it with all my heart!’<br />
                                    <br /> A happy-looking Juliette, lifts her finger up and continues - ‘YOU MUST WONDER: what did she gain besides these killer abs?’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> This page is one very large illustration with a little bit of narration, and Juliette talking at the end. It’s a giant shot of the pole studio with all these different dances, hanging, inverting, spinning, and hand-standing. They’re a diverse group, with all kinds of bodies, genders and ethnicities, and all of them look like they’re having fun. In the middle is Juliette, happy as could be.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - ‘I found a safe space, where I could be myself. I gained a deep understanding of my body. I discovered my limits and boundaries, and how it felt to push and test them. I learned to embrace the discovery and journey. <br />
                                    <br /> Juliette - ‘And most importantly… I gained a wonderful community, that helps me change my life for the better!’<br />
                                    <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">First Time by DarkChibiShadow for Oh Joy Sex Toy 2024.<br /> The characters as described by the artist are; <br /> Boyfriend in the comic uses he/him and is a trans man. He's an excitable guy with big, square glasses and scruffy hair. Despite this, his beard is well kept and short.<br /> Girlfriend in the comic uses she/her and is a cis woman. She's a patient person who long bangs that almost cover her eyes and a thick, curvy body. She's strong too.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> "Holy shit, HOLY SHIT!" Boyfriend thinks to himself as his heart audibly beats. "It's really happening! Right here, right now, I am THE luckiest guy in the world!"<br />
                                    <br /> "You ready?" The blue-haired girlfriend asks from between his brief-clad legs. She looks cool as a cucumber up at him, enjoying these moments before diving in. <br />
                                    <br /> "Soooo soooooooooooooooo ready!" Boyfriend replies, perhaps a little too eagerly and gratefully.<br />
                                    <br /> With a peck on the cheek, she tells him, "That's my guy." and then proceeds to yank off his briefs. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> "Wow..." she marvels upon seeing his junk. "You're really hard..." His T dick pulses in excitement. <br />
                                    <br /> Looking dreamily at his girlfriend, he thinks "It's amazing to hear her say that!"<br />
                                    <br /> She holds his dick between her fingertips and leans in with her tongue out. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Her mouth engulfs his dick with an OMF. <br /> "Ah!" he exclaims, as if struck by lightening. Her tongue swirls around his cock, making him exclaim "Oh fuck!".<br />
                                    <br /> Keeping the suction on, she pulls her head back along the length of his dick and then playfully releases it with an exhalation. <br /> "Aah..." He pants while resting a hand on the back of her head while she bobs away on his crotch. "S-so nice..." She continues to hungrily slurp away at it. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> The boyfriend leans back in a delirium as his girlfriend continues to go to town on him. "This is even better than I ever could have imagined, holy shit..." He thinks to himself, huffing. "Ah! oh! OH!"<br />
                                    <br /> In a mild he panic he realizes, "Oh no! No no! Gonna cum -- it's too soon!" He holds at as best he can but his girlfriend's mouth is relentless and eventually forces him to exclaim "AHHHH! FUCK!" as he cumss.<br /> "Mm" she coos at him as his orgasm settles down. She looks happy drunk on the taste of her partner. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> "Feeling good?" She asks him with fluids dripping down her chin while he pants in recovery. <br /> Now snapping back into this world, he jolts upright asking "You KIDDING?! I-is there anything I can do for you?!"<br /> The girlfriend lunges to the side, looking horny and hungry. She returns holding a prosthetic dick, asking, "Well, if you're not too tired..." <br /> The boyfriend has that surprised Pikachu face. <br /> "Wanna try another first tonight?" She continues. <br /> From off-screen we hear "yes yes yes!" and giggling and lots of little hearts shooting up. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today's comic is drawn by Erika Moen and contains depictions of herself and her husband, Matthew Nolan. Erika is a white, Cis woman with she/her pronouns. She’s drawn in a fairy costume with short brown hair and pom-poms on her flat pumps in today's comic. Matthew is a cis white male who goes by he/him pronouns. He has green hair, cool, bright shoes, and a plain T-shirt and trousers combo.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Erika sweeps across the page dressed as a fairy, she’s tied to the ceiling by a thick rope. Behind her is Matthew on the ladder tying up celebratory flags that say Happy Birthday Oh Joy Sex Toy.<br /> As she sweeps, Erika announces - ‘Greetings, gentle wanderer! I-’<br /> Matthew interrupts - ‘Erika?! Why are you dressed up like Tinker Bell?’<br />
                                    <br /> Erika gets close and squishes Matthew’s mouth in a loving but comedic way, interrupting him by putting her fingers in his mouth and smushing it.<br /> Erika - ‘Chht ! Matthew! I am not a gorgeous wife, who you once created Oh Joy Sex Toy with! No – I am… The Internet fairy!’<br /> She swoops away, floating in the air <br />
                                    <br /> The camera pans back and we see a huge birthday cake and presents, next to Matthew who’s still on his ladder.<br />
                                    <br /> Matthew - ‘Is this for the anniversary comic? Because I thought we agreed to a birthday thing for it again this year? I already paid for all the set dressing …’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Erika floats in from above and over a huge panel. Her dress flops over as she’s hanging upside down. Behind her is a puzzle piece board filling the background, on top of each puzzle piece is a throwback to the Internet from 2010’s. Little sentences such as ‘I has cheeseburger’, ‘Asking Jeeves for the meaning of life’, ‘Deconstructive, cishetronomativity, and sharing porn’, fill this board.<br />
                                    <br /> As Erika hangs, she talks and Matthew adds commentary from the side.<br /> Erika - ‘It’s a retrospective comic! Roll with it Nolan! Welcome to the 2010s when the Internet had a lot more space for… ‘<br /> Matthew - ‘Goofing with your friends in 140 characters brackets (Twitter)’<br /> Erika - ‘Tattooed and pierced pinup girl communities… (suicide girls)’<br /> Matthew - ‘Doing it for the vine …’<br /> Erika - ‘Writing academic feminist, theory, and posting hipster porn… (Tumblr)’<br /> Matthew - ‘Cake farts! Oh, such farts.’<br /> Erika - ‘But one piece is missing. The perfect space for… <br />

                                    <br /> Page 3.<br /> We are shown a panel of Erika in Matt from the past, leaping in the air with comic making paraphernalia floating around them.<br /> Erika - ‘And so, Oh Joy Sex Toy debutted 11 years ago.’<br /> Matthew - ‘What started as a two person boner-jokes funsies project…’ <br />
                                    <br /> The next panel has as an abstraction of the Earth on it around. It contains the rest of the Oh Joy Sex Toy team members. An Anonymous vampire. Ripley, a disheveled, anarchist bad ass. Ziggy a dog holding boss. Hein, a big, lovable bear. Jey a grinning happy, go lucky creative. Danny our transcriber guru!<br />
                                    <br /> On top of the illustration the narration continues<br /> Narration - ‘...grew into dozens of contributors in a dedicated team around the world.’<br /> Erika - ‘Who continue to make some of the best positive comics around!‘<br />
                                    <br /> Erika swings through on her rope, beneath her is a jungle that quickly becomes a desert, and on top of that are a bunch of gravestones belonging to different publications that have since closed, the jungle is labled as 2010’s publishing and the desert, 2020’s publishing.<br />
                                    <br /> Erika - ‘The landscape of online publishing has changed a lot over the last decade…’<br /> Matthew pours a bottle of liquid over The Nib’s gravestone, holding a hat in on his chest.<br /> Matthew - ‘Algorithms, restrictions, politics. Rest in printouts…’<br /> Erika continues ‘… and we’re watching as much larger publishers with much deeper pockets are downsizing or finally closing up shop.’<br /> A little meme’y ‘Press F to Pay Respects’ floats over the scene.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narration - ‘Which brings us to…’<br /> Big title <br /> Oh Joy Sex Toy’s Pledge Drive! <br /> patreon.com/OhJoySexToy<br /> Narration - ‘A site like this lives on its patron support and so over our birthday month, we’re asking loud and proud for sign ups.’<br />
                                    <br /> We’re shown a big panel of an arrow directed circular point-to-point loop.<br /> Subtitle - ‘How does this work?’<br />
                                    <br /> A little marshmallow person Clicks on a laptop - ‘You read comic’<br />
                                    <br /> We are shown a big coffee cup with a dollar sign on it - ‘You support on Patreon’ <br />
                                    <br /> Coffee cup goes into the hand of an artist - ‘We hire artist’ <br />
                                    <br /> The artist now starts work on a comic - ‘Artist makes comic’<br />
                                    <br /> ‘The comic appears on Oh Joy Sex Toy’<br />
                                    <br /> The final arrow points back to ‘You read comic’, closing the loop!<br />
                                    <br /> In the middle of this Loop is some narration text - ‘Oh Joy Sex Toy is artist-owned and Patreon supported. We pay artists with this income to make comics that they own and we get to share it with you on Oh Joy Sex Toy for free. No annoying pop-up ads, no paywalls, just comics.’<br />
                                    <br /> Erika does a fly by swoop with the sound effect ‘fwip!’<br /> Erika - ‘Committing to one buck per comic – about a coffee per month – keeps us going. Several bucks per comic? Keeps us thriving. Let’s talk about rewards!’<br />
                                    <br /> Beneath her is a title surrounded by presents, and around those presents are little subtitles.<br /> Title - Pledge Drive Exclusives, Only on the Patreon<br /> Subtitles - Essays, comics, Seacrest, podcast, interviews, behind-the-scenes stuff.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5.<br /> Narration - ‘In addition to the rest of the decades worth of bonus content, that patrons already have, we’ve got… All NEW exclusive, comics to share! We encouraged the team to explore topics important to them outside of the world of sex, and what they have made is just so powerful.’<br />
                                    <br /> We see a big wide panel of a bowl of Noodle Soup. It’s rendered extravagantly and above it is Hien Pham's lovely face. <br /> Title - ‘Hien Pham comics about noodle soup in a heartfelt homage to family.’<br />
                                    <br /> The next big wide panel is of Jey Pawlik's exclusive comic, we are shown as Jay takes a selfie using a instant camera with their grandpa.<br /> Title - ‘Jey Pawlik is back with a touching piece on the intimacy of instant photography.’<br />
                                    <br /> The third full wide panel is of a noisy club, we watch as Ripley LaCross heads towards the dance floor and takes off his glasses.<br /> Title - ‘Ripley LaCross invites us to jump into the mosh pit in this cleansing high-octane piece!’<br />
                                    <br /> We finally see Erika again she’s swinging past with hr arms behind her head and saying - ‘… And maybe a little something something for me.’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 6 Is just one big panel.<br /> It shows Matthew catching Erika as she sweeps by. Behind them, both is the birthday cake from page 1 and the presents. They’re looking at us, the reader as they talk.<br />
                                    <br /> Erika - ‘From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so, so much to all of you, from our contributors, supporters, and readers.’ <br />
                                    <br /> Matthew - ‘You’ve kept this site going for all its 11 years.’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> ---<br />
                                    <br /> Today's lovely comic was made by Erika and Matt, who desperately need support to keep doing this weekly comic! https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy <br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 03/01/24.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today’s comic is called Finding Furry and was drawn by Hien Pham, he goes by he/him and is depicted in this comic as a big anthropomorphic male bear. Conversing with him throughout the comic is his friend who’s depicted as a tiger with a little black mustache.<br /> Hien’s brown bear fursona wears a yellow T-shirt with a white pattern across it, and some beige shorts while his friend wears a red tank top with black shorts.<br />
                                    <br /> Today’s comic is colored in light pretty colors with lots of little hair lines here and there, making these anthropomorphic characters feel very welcoming and approachable.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Starts with Tiger and Bear-Hien sitting on the couch, around them is a lovely warm living room. The two of them are scrolling on their phones texting back and forth. We are showing two panels of the phone conversation as they throw different memes back and forth to each other.<br />
                                    <br /> The first panel<br /> Hien - ‘No, but she was my fave queen’<br /> Tiger - ‘I love her too… But I think the hair was a bit too dramatic for the outfit :( ‘<br /> Hien replies with a meme of a raccoon looking up in love, it has the following words printed on it<br /> ‘100 pplin a room 99 think ur trash. I’ll be your 1 raccoon’<br />
                                    <br /> The next panel continues the conversation<br /> Hien sends another meme of the same raccoon. This one has a spotlight, and sparkles surrounding him. His cute little eyes are large, and he wears tomato sauce all over his face. Racoon has been caught digging through some trash. This meme has the following words on it.<br /> ‘bb if you’re one man’s garbo, you can be my treasure’<br />
                                    <br /> Tiger replies - ‘Considering your meme catalog, I’m surprised your fursona isn’t a raccoon…’<br />
                                    <br /> The conversation picks up with us back in the room with the pair, as they switch to using words instead of memes to communicate.<br /> Hien happily replies - ‘Hee hee! There’s still time I guess. I just feel very beary for right now!’<br />
                                    <br /> Tiger presses a little bit further, with curiosity on his face - ‘How did your bear ‘sona come about? Did it start with memes as well?’<br />
                                    <br /> The page ends with Hien looking up thoughtfully, as he touches the side of his bear chin - ‘Hmm… Nah… It just kind of happened over time?’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Is almost entirely one very large splash page of multiple characters as Hienand Tiger explores the subject! This splash page starts with Little John from Robin Hood, who is himself a large, comical-looking bear. Beneath him is Baloo from jungle book, who’s a naked, black bear! And following that is a picture of a regular human bear, which is just a large hairy man!<br />
                                    <br /> Each of these characters is very happy with grins and hearts abound. Around the splash page of characters are small little headshots of Hien and Tiger as they talk, giving these illustrations context.<br />
                                    <br /> Hien - ‘I’ve always love anthropomorphic animal characters! Like Lil John and Robin Hood and Baloo in the Jungle Book.<br /> Tiger - ‘The *Bear* Necessities!’ <br />
                                    <br /> Hien - ‘They were joyful, larger than life figures with great sense of humor that everyone around them loved. I was a big and insecure kid, always on the fringe of social circles… Looking up to them, gave me hope, you know?<br /> And get this when I started to discover my sexuality, I found that I had a type… ‘<br /> Tiger - ‘Let me guess *Bears?*’ <br />
                                    <br /> The page finishes on a big, wide panel of Hien flexing his muscles with Tiger clapping his hands earnestly behind him.<br /> Hien - ‘And so this bear was born! Embodying him helps me work toward that cuddly, cheerful ray of sunshine, I want to be!’<br /> Tiger - ‘And that you are!’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Tiger pulls up his phone and starts scrolling and talking - ‘My process was the reverse, actually. I stumbled on the visuals first.’<br />
                                    <br /> We are shown a front profile and side profile of a drawn anthropomorphic Tiger with a little color palette next to it. It’s a character sheet: something used to help guide other people to help draw specific characters. <br />
                                    <br /> Tiger explains - ‘I’ve always liked the look of furry art, so I was following a lot of artists online. One day I saw a premade character sheet for sale, and I just fell in love with Tiger!’<br />
                                    <br /> Tiger makes a Dragon Ball Z blast at a little goober in the corner of a panel, It’s in black and white.<br /> Tigher - ‘I wrote stories and role-played with my friends and Tiger’s personality just came out!’<br />
                                    <br /> We’re back in the room with Tiger and Hien as Tiger lays back a bit and continues his explanation, Hien is sat up in earnest interest.<br />
                                    <br /> Tigar - ‘Similarly, some start with premade fursuits, and the ‘sona’s grow organically as they wear them!’<br /> Hien - ‘That’s so cool!’<br />
                                    <br /> Hien thoughtfully looks up and scratches his cheek while Tiger continues to scroll on his phone looking for examples.<br /> Hien - ‘I wonder how other folks came up with the fursuits?’<br /> Tiger - ‘I know who we could ask!’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> This page is cut up into four equally sized panels. Each one is a little vignette-style interview with a different anthropomorphic person who explains how they came about their first fursona.<br />
                                    <br /> The first one is of a boar-man who talks at the screen in some kind of woodland setting, silhouetted characters sit behind waving. His name is shown in a little pop-up, as Burley. Burley is heavy set and wears a black tank top with a matching black nose piercing.<br />
                                    <br /> Burley- ‘I discovered what being a furry was in 1998, and it took creating 10 ‘sona’s before I found features that felt right! Now, going to my internal sacred grove to visit them feels like a practice and mindfulness. ‘<br />
                                    <br /> The next character is called Quasiotter, a small otter who is lying in bed, wearing a red shirt surrounded by different plushies and toys. They’re holding one stuffed otter tightly as they talk.<br /> Quasiotter - ‘My mom started to give me otter-themed gifts. After I told her, I was an Otter in the Bears community. When I was asked, if I had a fursona, this just felt natural! ‘<br />
                                    <br /> The third character is called Gnomen, who is a heavy-set, hybrid between a bear and a bison, with a hefty silver nose piercing and a fun plaid vest. He’s talking from a back porch in the mountains<br /> Gnomen - ‘I was a bear for many years in the 1989’s queer communities. Then, the online furry spaces inspired me to create a fursona that spoke to my bi-racial identity. Gnomen is both a bear and a bison with a body I wish I had.’<br />
                                    <br /> The fourth final character is a blue-beaked bird with gray-tipped hair, wearing a turtleneck sweater, he seems barrel-chested, but that might just be because he’s a bird-person! His name is Fistuk, and behind him is just the sky filled with clouds.<br /> Fistuk - My current Sona is based on my favorite bird! The house sparrow is a common species, and he reminds me to find joy in the little things… That’s something I want to do for everyone.’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5.<br /> We’re back in the room with Hien and Tiger, on the couch. Hien is blushful as he touches his face, and Tiger gesticulates with his hand.<br /> Tiger - Ooh-de-lally! It’s amazing, isn’t it? A fursona is like… a song, or a book.’<br /> Hien picks up the thread as part of his conclusion - ‘A creative process, through which we make sense of the world, and would make sense of ourselves!’<br />
                                    <br /> Panel shows a anthromophic sloth hanging from the ceiling, reading a book. Beneath the sloth is a possum also reading their book. It’ s a reading date! Both characters are adorbz. Next to that is another panel of a hyena brushing out their hair as they look at themselves in the mirror, dashing!<br />
                                    <br /> Hien continues his narration as he starts about closing this comic<br /> Hien - ‘If you didn’t have to bear the weight of being human, what do you like about yourself? Who do you want to work toward becoming?’<br />
                                    <br /> This next panel show’s a shot from below of a dragon who’s flying through the night sky<br /> Hien narration - A fursona could represent the love and care someone has for you. Or perhaps, the love and care you want to have for yourself!’<br />
                                    <br /> The comic finishes on a close-up of Ian and tiger, embracing as close friends. Warmth, hearts, and feel good emotions float around.<br /> Tiger - ‘It’s wonderful, how many ways there are to create a fursona, and how many meanings to instill into them!’<br /> Hien concludes his comic - ‘On the journey to find myself, I am glad to have found my furry!’<br />
                                    <br /> ---<br />
                                    <br /> Today's lovely comic was made by Hien Pham who can be found at hienpham.artstation.com<br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 02/25/24 who doesn't really know how to transcribe things, but is hoping you were able to enjoy it regardless.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> Alex, our genderqueer protagonist, uses he/they pronouns and is a medium brown skinned person with a slim frame and black locs that extend to the length of the ears and undercut. He is riding a cramped bus with their beach gear (a rainbow beach umbrella, cooler, and thermos), with a dozing guy leaning into him on the left and a mother tending to her crying child on the right. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Today, I went to my first-ever beach day with friends at Riis Beach-- the only specifically queer beach in New York City. <br />
                                    <br /> They look at their reflection in the window, smiling.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration: I realized how lucky I am to have queer friends to hang out with.<br />
                                    <br /> The bus doors open and Alex steps out, wearing pink shorts, strawberry knee-high socks, and green sandals. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Growing up, it wasn't like that. <br />
                                    <br /> Little stars and hearts of excitement pop around their head as they slide their heart-shaped sunglasses on. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: It took time for me to find the community that could celebrate me. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> In a flashback, we see Alex as a ten year old kid in a toy store. Their eyes light up as they spot a fashion doll in her box, and he brings it to his parents. <br /> "Can I get this toy?" They ask, excited. <br /> "Come on now," one of the adults responds. "you don't really want that, do you?"<br /> In response, he looks embarrassed and worried. <br /> As the family leaves, his mom asks, "Now are you sure you didn't want anything from the store?"<br /> "I... uh didn't see anything I wanted." They respond, looking away while their sibling looks excited about their own toy they picked up. <br />
                                    <br /> In another flashback, Alex quickly removes his hands from their pockets, looking worried and alarmed as they are admonished by an unseen person, "Oh. Get your hands out of your pockets. It makes you swish when you walk. You don't want that."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> Now a little older, Alex sits in a school art studio, drawing in their sketchbook while others are doing their own thing around him. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: When I did find queer connections, those worries about "fitting right" disappeared.<br />
                                    <br /> "Hey, what are you drawing?" Asks a student from behind Alex, startling him. <br /> "NOTHING!" They reply as they fumble their pencil and sketchbook.<br /> "Can I see that?" The student asks, looking interested while Alex tries to "casually" lean over his book to cover it up. <br /> "It's not something cool. It's kinda girly." They admit to the schoolmate. <br /> "So?" His new friend asks and together they sit, talking while going through the sketchbook. Little hearts and stars sparkle around the two as they connect over a shared interest. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Alex applies lipstick.<br /> Narration: Those friendships supported and sustained me through tough times. <br />
                                    <br /> He looks at himself in the mirror, now in their 20s, wearing eye shadow, lipstick, and a magenta shirt. He looks uncertain of my themself but is interrupted by a knock at the door. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: They were always there in one way or another. <br />
                                    <br /> "Come in." They call to the door, which is quickly flooded with friends entering the house. <br /> "You better be ready, we gotta go." One says with a smile. <br /> "Yo, you look amazing! I love the eye shadow." One friend says, while Alex smiles and poses, hearts and starts blooming around them. "ALEX! You decided to finally try the red lipstick I gave you?"<br /> "Thanks, guys." Says Alex, looking absolutely delighted. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> Back in the present day, Alex reclines on the beach next to a friend. Alex wears their heart-shaped pink sunglasses that go with their pink speedo. <br />
                                    <br /> Narration: Thanks to these friendships, I've found a sense of safety, value, and acknowledgment. <br />
                                    <br /> "Hey! Love your pink speed!" A new person announces as they approach Alex.<br /> "I know right? It's my favorite." Replies Alex proudly, standing up and posing a little to show it off while stars and hearts flutter around them. <br /> "Alex." Says the friend who was reclining with him. "We're going to head to the water."<br /> "Hey, do you want to join us?" Alex asks the new person. <br /> "Yeah!" The new person agrees as they all start heading towards the water. "I'd love to."<br />
                                    <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today’s comic is written and drawn by Ene, whos pronouns are she/her. She is drawn with long curly hair, circular glasses, and hoop earings with an average build. She’s often drawn wearing baggy loose clothing.<br />
                                    <br /> Paired up with her is her cis partner at the time, whose pronouns are he/him. His name isn’t included in today’s comic so I will refer to him as P (for partner). He is drawn often in a hoodie and jeans with very short buzzed hair and a wee pointy nose.<br />
                                    <br /> The comic today is drawn in subtle blues and whites, that really let the lovely linework shine. It’s cartoony and friendly with curves and character in every panel. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br />
                                    <br /> The comic starts with;<br /> Ene’s narration - ‘A while back, I was dating this person.’<br /> We can see Ene and P making out on a bed, she straddling him and they’re kissing with little hearts floating around.<br />
                                    <br /> His hand slowly reaches down to her ankle. <br /> Narration - ‘When I look back at the beginning of our relationship, I wonder how I didn’t catch on sooner. ‘<br />
                                    <br /> P - ‘Your feet are really… cute.’<br /> Ene - ‘What?’ <br /> She pulls back from the Makeout session to look at him in mild surprise.<br />
                                    <br /> P Turns his head shyly away.<br /> P - ‘Well… I mean, it’s just feet, um. But for feet, they’re kind of pretty, that’s all!’<br />
                                    <br /> She turns his head back to hers with a soft and kind head-holding gesture.<br /> Ene - ‘That’s a strange compliment… but it’s sweet I guess.’<br />
                                    <br /> We’re shown a wide panel of four quick illustrations across the rest of the page with narration woven throughout.<br /> Narration - ‘Yet, there were a few clues…’<br />
                                    <br /> The first is of Ene sitting on the couch next to P, with him blushing away nervously as she rests her feet in his lap. <br /> Narration - ‘How he used to blush whenever I would put my feet on his lap while we watched a movie.<br /> Then a third moment of him blushing deeply, and looking away while sweating profusely. <br />
                                    <br /> Next we see her pulling up her stockings as she’s getting dressed<br /> Narration - ‘How he seemed so happy to see me put on my stockings.’<br />
                                    <br /> Finally the fourth one is a text conversation between the two of them on her phone, as she contemplates buying some new shoes. <br /> Narration - ‘Or how invested he was when I was shopping for shoes.’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - ‘Eventually, one day, we were talking about sex. We had already chatted about our preferences a few times before. I don’t know what was different about this time. But that’s when he told me about it for the first time.’<br /> Behind this narration is a big picture of the two of them in bed, naked with bits of clothing and regular bedroom debris strewn about. Ene is holding up some tea and listening to P. It’s very cozy.<br />
                                    <br /> The camera focuses on P over three panels, to give his face room to articulate his moment, as he slowly opens up and tells her… <br /> P - ’It feels strange… saying it out loud. I never really talked about it with any of my partners. I mean, I tried once throwing a line out to one of them. But I didn’t insist. I didn’t want to feel like I was pushing something, you know?’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> The camera turns back to Ene as we see her reaction. She’s listening intently as P finishes his monologue.<br /> P - ‘So you’re kinda the first one I’ve told.’<br />
                                    <br /> Ene leap-hugs P with excited energy.<br /> Ene - ‘Thank you.’ <br /> Narration - ‘I remember feeling honored that he felt safe enough to share with me.’<br />
                                    <br /> The next panel is a pair of feet being touched gently, in a different moment in time. <br /> Narration - ‘We talked a lot about it the following days, and decided to take it slow.’<br />
                                    <br /> We see the same pair of feet now being kissed by P <br /> Narration - ‘We were just experimenting, trying to see what felt good.’<br />
                                    <br /> Next we are shown three panels, focused entirely on Ene as she’s slowly melts down the bottom of the panels, as if she were leaning against a wall and her feet were slipping away. It’s a fun visual of ‘slowly falling and slipping. <br /> A little floating P face speaks up to start these three panels.<br /> P - ‘Can I try… licking them?<br /> Ene holds up her hand in a mildly acquiescing gesture.<br /> Ene - ‘Yeah, you can. I just don’t know if I’m going to feel much!’<br />
                                    <br /> The second panel hits with some exclamation mark visuals, Ene beings the slide.<br /> Ene - ‘I mean –’ she starts before being interrupted by the next panel. <br />
                                    <br /> Ene is dropping away, as P must be working his foot magic.<br /> A blushing happy Ene - ‘Damn…’<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4.<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - ‘It was refreshing and fun to discover a whole new field of possibilities. And what excited me even more about all these new options was that they weren’t centered around penetrative sex, which I wasn’t very interested in at the time. This time we spent together was just about discovering other ways of having sex.’<br />
                                    <br /> The page is a big, curving path; on top of that path are multiple illustrations outside panels. It’s a playful way of showing their growing adventure and exploration through feet and time. Time-feet!<br />
                                    <br /> The first illustration is of Ene’s phone, and the conversation that the two of them have on it<br /> Ene sends P a Feet pic. <br /> Phone Ene - ’Does this red suit me? <br /> Phone P - ‘heart-emoji<br /> I swear everything looks so good on you. Can’t wait to see you Fire-emoji’<br /> Supporting this is a little pop-up tag that says<br /> ‘Another way of Sexting.’ <br />
                                    <br /> We see P kneeling in front of and moisturizing Ene’s feet as she looks down happily. Next to it is a tag that says:<br /> ‘Another way of getting pampered’<br />
                                    <br /> The third illustration is of P holding up a pair of stiletto shoes<br /> P - ‘I finally brought them.’<br />
                                    <br /> The final illustration is of P’s Jean covered groin, being gently kneaded and petted by Ene’s bare feet with the tag next to it, saying;<br /> ‘Another way of teasing.’<br />
                                    <br /> The page ends with two little portraits of the pair, looking at each other playfully.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> We see Ene in the bath as she scrubs her feet, narration follows the rest of this page, as she shares thisi moment with us.<br /> Narration - ‘I’ve always liked my feet, but now there is something else… I think I’ve learned to find them sexy.’<br />
                                    <br /> The camera floats higher as we see her sit back and just submerge herself.<br />
                                    <br /> We briefly visit her half-submerged face, as she stares down and looks at her wiggling toes on the other side of the bathtub.<br /> Narration - ‘And even though I’m not with this partner anymore.’<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - ‘The way I see them has remained the same.’<br /> She reaches for her phone and quickly takes a Feet pic of herself.<br /> Ene - ‘Cute.’ She says while looking at the photo.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Today's autobiographical comic about Feet and Foot Fetishes was made by Ene, who can be found at https://www.instagram.com/ene_42/<br /> The comic was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 03/11/24.<br /> Oh Joy Sex Toy is paid for and supported by Patreon, where readers like yourself can come and support these comics and transcriptions, while ALSO getting bonus comics!

                                <br /> This little comic is my personal experience with asexuality. It’s so important to me that this isn’t interpreted as the only asexual experience. Every ace person has a different story to tell, and it’s so important to listen to every voice! My aceness also ties into my gender and my experience with romance; introspection for another day, perhaps!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today's comic is by Lilaeleaf (L), who self-describes as she/they, short, androgynous, with white skin and dark curly hair that has teal ends. L wears a dark green shirt and gray pants. The comic is autobiographical, as L shares with us moments in her past and present, as they relate to her asexuality. It's drawn in purples and hues reminiscent of the Ace flag.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Opens with a text conversation between L and somebody else on her Instagram. This mysterious Stranger, sends out a message, in the form of a comment on an Instagram image L posted that shows them celebrating 'Happy Ace Week'.<br /> 'Hey!! I think I might be Ace… Is it OK if I ask you about your experience blushing-face-emoji and eyes emoji'<br /> El replies 'Of course!! Being ace is so cool and you’re not alone, hearts emoji'<br />
                                    <br /> In the next panel, the camera is focused on L as she looks at her phone<br /> 'If I’m honest, I don’t recall the moment I realized I was Ace.'<br />
                                    <br /> We cut into the past as we see a younger L scrolling through Tumblr in front of them is a page with the title 'Asexuality! It’s a thing! But it’s 2016 so no one knows much about it.'<br /> El continues explaining through her narration.<br /> L narration - 'I probably stumbled on the term while on Tumblr, feeling seen by the definition at 16.'<br />
                                    <br /> This younger L is in bed now with a mildly thoughtful and worried look on their face.<br /> L narration - 'And became an integral part of me, helping me navigate a slurry of feelings I couldn’t quite place.'<br /> 'It can be especially difficult as we are fed this idea of a cookie-cutter life growing up.'<br /> We see depictions of the cookie-cutter, life, a video of an assumedly cis and heterosexual couple kissing, a photo of a nuclear family, and next to it some basic sexy romance novels.<br /> 'There’s a lack of stories and perspectives that could help people understand the complexity and beauty of it.'<br />
                                    <br /> We cut back to the current day, L lying back on some pillows, surrounded by toys and her tablet and books. <br /> L - 'And just a lot of misconceptions about asexuality in general.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> We're given a five panel showcasing depicting some of the worst misconceptions L's been exposed to.<br />
                                    <br /> 'That’s not normal…'<br /> Says a voice from offscreen. L raises her finger to try to protest<br />
                                    <br /> 'I wish I was Ace, I’m always so horny, it’s so annoying !' says another.<br /> L holds her hand up in mild frustration.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Do you masturbate?' <br /> A disgruntled-looking L just stares back.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Procreating is the purpose of humans'<br /> El holds up the word 'NOPE', in reply.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Are you capable of love at all?'<br /> El just stares back in shock.<br />
                                    <br /> A title sits on top of the last few panels taped on with tape!<br /> Asexuality: experiencing little to no sexual attraction.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Having established the asexual, hailstorm of questions and misconceptions, we return to modern-day, L. She's sitting in an abstract, cloudy display.<br /> L - 'Part of me is always fighting a gentle loneliness, a fear of solitude in this world where romantic and sexual relationships are prioritized.'<br />
                                    <br /> L is now depicted holding a swinging sword, DnD style, now dressed for the fight!<br /> L - 'But, I can’t let myself feed those thoughts!'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Some floating narration starts this page, still in the cloudy abstract.<br /> L narration - 'My existence is different from many, but that’s the beauty of life! Being asexual doesn’t mean being alone forever. That’s a common misconception!'<br />
                                    <br /> L is surrounded by her friends, a whole multitude of people, all happily, hugging, embracing<br /> L narration - 'I have my friends...'<br />
                                    <br /> Now we see a bundle of people holding cups, their hands all engaged in conversation<br /> L narration - 'My family...'<br />
                                    <br /> L boops her face against her dog who looks lovingly back.<br /> L narration - 'My dog. [she’s also my therapist]'<br />
                                    <br /> The floating narration returns.<br /> L narration - 'There is so much love to give and receive and feel. The label of Asexuality is something that helped me understand, in larger strokes, how I approach the world around me.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> In the panel, L is holding and waving the Ace flag as her friends and community chase behind her with their own flags of support.<br /> L - 'It makes me feel seen and gives me a community!'<br />
                                    <br /> L narration - 'I’ve also found peace and self-acceptance through creating art that brings people to me validating the lot of us!'<br /> We now see L in front of her tablet, as she scribbles away, stars and light emanate from the screen in front of her.<br /> L - 'Making characters that represent me.'<br />
                                    <br /> This next panel is filled with depictions of her drawn DND characters. A little Teifling is mostly on display.<br /> L - 'Characters that portray asexuality the way, I experience it.'<br />
                                    <br /> We're now shown a panel FILLED to the brim with reactions to said illustrations of this art. I wish I could cover it all, but there are simply hundreds of kind loving emoji field reactions. It's lovely. <br />
                                    <br /> The camera pans back to L who looks on with a modicum of surprise as she blushes at the reactions.<br />
                                    <br /> We finish the page with L in bed, holding the phone tight to her chest as an ace heart floats above her.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5.<br />
                                    <br /> L narration - 'I like to think that I have a view on the world around me from a unique perspective.'<br />
                                    <br /> We’re shown the sky filled with birds, followed by L being embraced tightly by a person she must care deeply for.<br />
                                    <br /> This is then followed by an assortment of hands, holding, one another, touching and making hearts with the negative shapes.<br /> L narration - 'I find the beauty in intimacy in my own way.'<br />
                                    <br /> L narration - 'Maybe a lack of sexual desire helps bring my focus on the other aspects of life, love, and friendship.'<br /> We see L doing yoga, drawing excitedly, and just being excited to be herself.<br />
                                    <br /> This page and comic ends on two more floating narrations, drawn in a way that makes it look like she’s been replying to the instigating Instagram comment all along. The comic has come full circle!<br /> L narration - 'As I come into my own, I cannot express the relief I feel every day, knowing I can live my life just being me. Just know that anything you experience is valid! Heart-emoji I’m here for you!!'<br />
                                    <br />

When my body feels so fundamentally unrepresentative of me, it can be a huge relief to hang artwork in this strange fleshy home I inhabit to try to make it feel more comfortable and more mine. It took me years to access gender-affirming medical care, but there are more tattoo shops than grocery stores in my neighborhood here in Portland.</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today's autobiographical comic is written and drawn by JOCKBUNS, who described himself for today's transcription as; male with he/him pronouns, of a short, chubby tattooed, hairy, trans man body with top surgery scars; a shape similar to that of a Bear! This transcriber (me, Matthew, hi-hello!) will add that he appears white, with brown hair, and wears thin white round glasses. The comic is colored in oranges, browns, and teals with big white breaks in between panels, which helps give the narration nice beats and pauses. The vibe lends the comic an air of intimacy and friendliness<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 1 <br /> Opens with JOCKBUNS (whose professional name is capitalized, but I don't want text-to-speech to shout-it-out so will refer to him as JB going forward) in bed, half nude, wearing a beanie, as he gesticulates towards an old wire TV. His left arm is all wrapped up in a bandage.<br />
                                    <br /> JB - I just got tattooed!<br /> And my arm is all wrapped up, so I can’t draw much.<br />
                                    <br /> JB pulls out his Nintendo Switch. He takes a moment to think to himself, and the camera pulls in on his face.<br />
                                    <br /> We see JB standing in front of a mirror, wearing a neckerchief and tight underwear. His tummy and body are on display as if being seen in a mirror.<br /> JB - The downtime got me thinking… about the relationship between my body confidence in my tattoos.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> JB is now on display as a nude life model, flexing his muscles in front of all the students, narration supports the visual.<br /> JB - My tattoos have been a transformative tool for my self-confidence.<br />
                                    <br /> The camera zooms in on jocks arms, thick and heavy with tattoos abound.<br /> JB - Allowing me to replace the negative energy I felt toward my body with positive.<br />
                                    <br /> He closes his eyes, and emanating from him is the words 'I love myself' with sparkles as the students continue their studies.<br />
                                    <br /> Next, we see JB lying on a bed in a tattoo artist shop with shorts and socks on he’s lifting his hand up in a thumbs up. A word balloon creeps away from him in a skull and crossbones shape, inside it is the words 'Worth it.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3.<br />
                                    <br /> We're somewhere else again, a more abstract place - on the wall is a flyer with an illustration of JB's chest without the surgery he's since had. Next to it is the words 'For Sale, Titties: No Longer Wanted'<br /> JB supports the visual with some narration: Gender-affirming medical care isn’t always available.<br />
                                    <br /> JB - And can take a long time to access even when it is<br /> We see a calendar with '732 days' on it next to the words 'without a mustache' and a sad face emoji.<br />
                                    <br /> JB - I see my tattoos as a sort of additional or alternative therapy. A way of molding my body that I am in control of.<br /> He's back in front of a mirror, using a sharpie to draw onto the glass, so the drawings appear on his body. He’s got a devious grin on him, as he says, 'Perfect!'<br />
                                    <br /> We’re back in the tattoo artist's parlor. The walls are littered with beautiful little illustrations as a burly artist leans over and continues his trade on JB.<br /> Tattoo Artist - Looks rad!<br />
                                    <br /> JB gets up and looks at the new tattoo on his ankle, in a mirror, giving himself a thumbs up with sparkles.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> We're shown a full wall of the tattoo artist parlor, as JB looks at the art. Every inch of the wall is framed illustrations, some of horses, others of hearts and suns and moons, and even swords and cats; all kinds of amazing stuff.<br /> Underneath this is some narration from JB<br /> JB - I used to struggle with body image issues a lot. My dysphoria made me feel like my body wasn’t mine. It was always against me. I didn’t find it beautiful.<br />
                                    <br /> We see three rapid panels back to back.<br /> Jock shows us his left forearm with a big horseshoe tattoo on top of which is a banner, saying 'Stay Lucky', the tattooed looks imagined and not-yet-real, or a work-in-progress.<br /> The neckerchief, half nude JB continues to study himself in the mirror, holding up a phone with an illustration on it to his body he considers the art.<br /> Then we see him scrolling through an artist's portfolio on their Instagram with the words Flash Sale.<br /> Underneath these panels is some narration: <br /> JB - The realization I could get colors, artwork, and imagery I love permanently slapped on my body was a game changer!<br />
                                    <br /> JB goes to work on his tablet, behind him are floating tattoo ideas one of a snake and another of a dragon, the ideas floating around. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> JB - My tattoos have helped radically transform my view of my body...<br /> JB leans back from his tablet, with a contended look about him. The next few word balloons come from him as he talks.<br /> JB - turning it into a walking art gallery… a scrapbook of memories… and a point of inspiration in my professional life.<br />
                                    <br /> A T-pose, half-nude JB stands in front of us, as mouse icons from a desktop computer drag and drop tattoo art onto his body.<br /> JB - I feel more like myself with tattoos than without them. Each one makes me feel more in alignment with the person I was always supposed to be.<br />
                                    <br /> The final panel of the comic shows JB back in bed playing games as his arm heals, Sneaking out from under the bandages is a reveal-popup of the final tattoo design; an intricate and beautiful horseshoe, with the words 'Stay Lucky' printed on a banner in front of it. Behind that are some flowers - it looks great!<br /> JB - They've helped me gain that confidence in my body that I lacked for so, so long.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Today's comic about owning one’s body and customizing it to reflect who you are, is by JOCKBUNS who can be found at https://twitter.com/JOCKBUNS<br /> The comic was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 2/26/24.<br /> Oh Joy Sex Toy is paid for and supported by Patreon, and we'd ask for any and all support you can give us there, so we can keep these comics and transcriptions going for another year or ten!

                                <div id="transcript-content">Today's comic is drawn by Hien Pham, in red and brown tones, it feels warm and is drawn with a joyous energy.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 1 starts with a heavy-set white male appearing character in shorts and a T-shirt walking back into his home, he wears a brown beard and his baulding on top. In his hand, he’s carrying some food in a Takeaway bag. For simplicity's sake, I will call him Beard!<br /> 'Honey, I’m home' Beard exclaims.<br />
                                    <br /> He takes a moment to breathe in the delicious smells of his food.<br /> 'Oh, can’t wait to sit down to snack and relax~'<br />
                                    <br /> Out of nowhere, a second character appears, leaping out on the corner of the panel. He’s also a heavy-set white male appearing character, but comes with a mustache and curly tied-up hair. He, too, is wearing a T-shirt and shorts, but in addition to that, bransdishs a cape, and a jockstrap on top of his head. For simplicity's sake, I will call him Goblin!<br /> 'Yahaha!' Goblin shouts<br /> 'Greetings traveler!'<br /> Beard's been caught unaware and leaps back.<br />
                                    <br /> Goblin puts his fingers together.<br /> 'Tis !! The Laundry, Goblin! We have crossed paths on the most joyous day! Laundry day! I challenge thee to a game of wits! Answer mine riddles, true, and I shall grant you a wish! Answer wrong, and thy shalt be left with nothing, but thy naked dong!<br />
                                    <br /> Beard wears a blank expression as he stares at his partner.<br /> 'Is that my jockstrap?'<br /> 'No! ‘Tis treasure I found fair and square! Now comes mine first question! Be prepared!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2 starts with goblin, presenting his first question;<br /> 'What is 1+1?'<br />
                                    <br /> Beard crosses his arms, and raises a questioning eyebrow<br /> 'hmmm… Is this a trick question?'<br /> 'WRONG!!! You can’t answer a question with a question!'<br />
                                    <br /> Goblin reaches down and starts to pull at beards shoes, removing them from his body<br /> 'What the heck! I was just clarifying!'<br /> 'I don’t make the rules! You break them, and I collect your socks and shoes~'<br />
                                    <br /> Goblin gives the boot a little kiss as he removes it.<br /> 'Ehehe'<br />
                                    <br /> BEfore he drags the socks off with his mouth:<br /> 'Yes, 'tis a good day indeed…'<br />
                                    <br /> Beard looks down, and a little heart appears as he sees Goblin between his legs<br /> 'Well, I suppose this isn’t so bad…'<br /> 'Is this relaxing?' replies Goblin.<br /> 'Maybe… Yeah…'<br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> 'WRONG!!!' Shouts Goblin, as he launches at Beard tearing at his top<br /> 'Aargh!!!'<br /> 'This is a matter of life and a little death! And now it’s time to expose your breasts!'<br />
                                    <br /> A half undressed Beard sticks out his tongue.<br /> 'This game is rigged!'<br /> 'Is it?' Replies Goblin as he touches Beards bare hairy chest.<br /> 'Ha ha, now, you learn!'<br />
                                    <br /> Goblin's hand drags down Beard's chest and gently tweaks and squeezes one of his nipples as he continues on.<br /> 'Only two things left on your body… Once more wrong, and down to your undies.'<br />
                                    <br /> The camera briefly goes down under, and we see a hand creeping down toward said undies!<br /> 'Hmm… Let’s make a deal.' Bear interrupts. <br /> 'I’ll give up my pants for free… But! If I win the last round, you forfeit everything you have!'<br /> Goblin looks on with unamused blush, <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Goblin takes a second to think<br /> 'Huh...'<br />
                                    <br /> 'I’ll pay upfront!' adds Beard<br /> 'A most agreeable deal' replies Goblin.<br /> They shake hands as gentlemen and the pact is made!<br />
                                    <br /> Goblin starts to undress his prize, slowly stripping the rest of Beard's clothes. <br /> Beard 'you’re really enjoying this, huh?'<br /> 'Hehe' snickers Goblin in return.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Suremakes me wonder… If you’ve got ulterior motives, perhaps?'<br />
                                    <br /> Goblin finds his way to Beard's cock kept hidden underneath its underwear. Goblin nestles up against it lovingly.<br /> 'Oh, but what ulterior motive could I possibly have?' <br />
                                    <br /> 'GOTCHA!' Shouts Beard as he leaps back and boops goblin on the nose with his accusatory finger. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The two tussle and clothes fly everywhere, as Beard exclaims:<br /> 'You can’t answer a question with a question act.'<br />
                                    <br /> Beard is now riding a top of goblin who’s been stripped of all his clothes, his cock, hard is poking away at Beard's clothed behind<br /> 'You should’ve thought of a tighter rule set to use against me!'<br />
                                    <br /> 'I really thought it was air-tight! I even rigged it and everything' explains a gleeful Goblin<br />
                                    <br /> We're shown a close-up of their hands, grasping each other, and their groins, as one sits on the other. and they intimately rub their noses together.<br /> 'And yet! You still owe me one whole wish!' continues Bear.<br /> 'Anything you’ve got planned… Your wishes this Laundrie Goblin's command…' Replies the excited goblin as the two blush together. <br />
                                    <br /> The final panel cuts to Goblin, putting the laundry into the machine as behind him Beard eats his well-earned lunch.<br /> 'And don’t forget to fold them too!'<br /> 'Dammit…' <br />
                                    <br /> ---<br />
                                    <br /> Today's comic was made by Hien Pham who can be found at hienpham.artstation.com<br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 02/19/24 who doesn't really know how to transcribe things, but is hoping you were able to enjoy it regardless. <br />

                                <a href="javascript:toggle_expander('transcript-content');" class="transcript-title">↓ Transcript Of Today's Comic</a>
                                <div id="transcript-content">Today’s autobiographic comic is drawn and written by Neil Kohney whos pronouns are he/him and Marissa Kohney, who's pronouns are she/her.<br /> Neil is depicted as pretty fit, with a short blonde curly hair, and Marissa is slightly shorter and has brown shoulder-length hair. The couple are fair-skinned and seem to be in their early middle ages.<br /> Today's comic jumps around a little bit in time and places as it depicts, their postpartum odyssey together as new parents.<br />
                                    <br /> Panel one opens up with Neil and Marissa in a hospital bed having just given birth, both are grinning, eyes a little crossed, both looking disheveled and obviously zapped. <br /> Narration - ‘Congratulations you’ve just had a beautiful little baby! Now, you’re probably thinking that you’ll never want to have sex again after that tiny angel, with a giant monster head ripped its way through your erstwhile sexual playground…’<br />
                                    <br /> ‘So, more good news! The doctor has decreed you and your partner sexless for at least six weeks’<br /> A doctor looks at the couple before saying <br /> 'No penetration until your cervix closes up'<br /> Marissa - 'Fine by me'<br /> Neil - 'Having witnessed what just happened here I too I’m fine.'<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - 'But a week into your celibacy, you may find yourself wanting to get bangin'.'Marissa sat on her couch, looks at her partner feeding the baby. His eyes are drifting, drool slowly creeps from his mouth, his clothes, obviously old are out of place. She squints as the camera zooms in on his crotch. before it pulls back out to show her biting her lip.<br /> Narration - 'But the fear of a cervical infection, or tearing, is enough to deter you.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> The couple are in bed naked, Neil is about to go down on his partner, and his eyes are wide<br /> Narration - 'To tide everyone over, hands and mouths start getting a lot more play. But it’s not quite the same. '<br /> Marissa - 'What’s wrong? Does it look bad?'<br /> Neil - 'Nope, great. Looks the same as before, honestly.'<br />
                                    <br /> The couple are leaping up in the air <br /> Narration - 'Nevertheless, after your six-week appointment, you’re cleared for takeoff!'<br />
                                    <br /> Marissa looks at herself partially nude in the mirror, her body has taken some obvious post-baby natural wear and tear. She looks upon stretch marks, worn-out breasts, and a bit of postpartum tummy pooch. <br /> Narration - 'But things feel different. Your body feels squishy, showering is a distant memory, and you’ve never felt so exhausted. Who are you anymore?'<br />
                                    <br /> Marissa pulls at her tummy with an unpleased expression she thinks to herself <br /> 'How is there this much extra skin?'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3Marissa enters the bedroom, a little apprehensive, covering herself in a robe. In front of her is a naked Neil splayed out ready for action on top of the bed.<br /> Narration - 'You might feel self-conscious, but never fret, friend. You are most definitely your own harshest critic.'<br /> Neil - 'Take that thing off, beautiful!'<br />
                                    <br /> Together on the bed, we see Neil knelt between Marissa‘s legs, squirting copious amounts of lube in between them. Even for a comic the amount of lube is especially ludicrous.<br /> Narration - 'Fears give way to fucking, as you melt back into each other. As long as you use lube. Lots and lots of lube.'<br /> Neil - 'More?'<br /> Marissa - 'Little more.'<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - 'you figure shit out together like you did when you were first hooking up. And just like then, communication is key.'<br /> The couple switches up their positions. Neil is now behind Marissa in a doggy-style position as he reach's to the side.<br /> Marissa - 'little softer… And maybe a little more lube.'<br /> Neil - 'On it.'<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - 'And if you happen to be a breast-feeding, parent, buckle up for some extra hurdles, baby.'<br /> Marissa is now on top of Neil, one of her breasts is very obviously more worn out than the other <br /> Neil - 'The baby has a preference, I see.'<br /> Marissa - 'Yeah, lefty is very tired. Please avoid staring and give her some space.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - 'Like the entire human experience, it can be daunting exhausting, weird, and kind of gross. But if everyone’s up for it, your new, lactation powers can be a fun addition to the bedroom or even just a handy signal.'<br /> We see Neil getting soaked by a fountain of two milk streams.<br /> Marissa - 'I’m close...'<br /> Neil - 'Yeah, I can tell.'<br />
                                    <br /> We cut to a different time. Marissa is on the couch, wearing sweatpants, pumping one of her breasts with a milk pump. Niels entered the room without his pants on, looking at the scene.<br /> Narration - 'Just remember, it’s OK if you’re libido isn’t playing ball every day. '<br /> Marissa - 'I want to, but I don’t want to, you know.'Neil - 'He understands.'<br />
                                    <br /> Narration - 'And sometimes, even if everything lines up, the baby still gets in the way.'<br /> Marissa is grabbing Neil’s hand and throwing it onto her crotch as the baby wales in the background.<br /> Marissa - 'I haven’t come in six days, you’re finishing this!'<br /> Neil - 'Uhhh…'<br />
                                    <br /> The couple are now partially naked, holding each other on the couch as they eat takeaway, clothes strewn about. <br /> Narration - 'But after a while, you find a new sense of normal.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Niel and Marrisa visit their sleeping child in its bedroom. <br /> Narration - 'The baby becomes a kid and learns to sleep through the night.'<br />
                                    <br /> Now the couple are out having coffee together looking happy<br /> Narration - 'You get your autonomy back, little by little, and feel more like a human being.'<br /> Marissa - 'Thank God for preschool!'<br />
                                    <br /> We see them having sexy antics again, as Marissa is squatting between Neil's legs.<br /> Narration - 'You and your partner ease into your new identities as parents, and as lovers who are also parents.'<br /> Marissa - 'Is it weird if I call you “daddy“?'<br /> Neil - 'Just don’t follow up with “I want a juice box“ and I’m good.'<br />

                                    <br /> Today's Postpartum Odyssey was written by both Marrissa and Neil Kohney, before Neil drew it! Neil's a prolific cartoonist who can be found primarily on https://www.instagram.com/neilkohney/<br /> The comic was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 2/12/24!<br />

I’m on the record as being a <i>big</i> IUD fan but, hoo-lee, that is a one-two punch in the cunt, for sure. As an IUD user of close to two decades, I’ve had insertions and removals that cross the pain spectrum from ‘Uncomfortable’ to ‘So excruciating that the doctor and medical staff all apologized to me afterwards’, and despite that, it’s still the birth control I’ll be sticking with for the foreseeable future.

                                    <br /> The comic starts with Alina in a doctor's office her legs raised in stirrups, she’s in a patient gown and nervously looking out from behind a Mirena IUD box towards the camera as she fills us in on, and what’s happening.<br /> 'I had an IUD put inside me earlier this year. It was also the first time I’ve had a pelvic exam in my life. Needless to say, I was extremely nervous.'<br />
                                    <br /> A tall, skinny redhead, feminine-appearing doctor, enters the office waving towards Alina.<br /> 'Hi Alina! Are we ready to go?'<br /> 'Oh, yeah.'<br /> 'Awesome!'<br />
                                    <br /> The doctor snaps on a pair of gloves, as Elena sweats.<br /> 'Bit late to back out now!' The doctor pronounces.<br />
                                    <br /> The comic flashes back to two weeks ago, Alina is with the same doctor as they talk about choices.<br /> The doctor starts the conversation ‘ so, you say the pill's been messing up your period?'<br /> 'Yeah, I’m bleeding like, every other week.' Alina responds<br /> 'Oof! Have you thought about getting an IUD?’<br /> 'Not really. It sounds kind of painful. And scary.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br />
                                    <br /> The doctor thoughtfully looks up.<br /> 'Well, the insertion can be. And it takes some getting used to.'<br />
                                    <br /> A big panel takes up most of the rest of the page showing a giant IUD, which in reality is a tiny T-shaped device intended to sit inside the uterus. Perched on top of the IUD are the doctor and Alina, looking down at said device as they talk over it.<br /> Doctor: 'But there’s a lot of upside to an IUD! This is the Mirena! It stops pregnancy by preventing your uterine lining from thickening. Most users have little to no period after insertion, so it can help with cramps too. It’s a one-time cost, so you can get it and forget about it for 5 to 8 yes!'<br /> 'That sounds pretty great!' <br />
                                    <br /> The doctor sits down at their computer<br /> 'Sweet! I can book you in for it in two weeks?'<br /> 'Two weeks!' Elena shouts<br />
                                    <br /> A tiny Marshmello version of herself nervously just for us readers, as the scene finishes. <br /> 'At this point, I’d never had a gyno exam. My first experience with one was going to be an IUD insertion too!'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> Alina walks us through some panels depicting her history and background. In this first panel, we see a younger Alina with her mother visiting a doctor long ago. A modern-day Alina is looking at us and narrating over the wordless scene.<br /> 'Growing up, I had very little control over my health. Even as an adult, my mom would take me to the doctor. Going to the gyno was only done if you were having sex.'<br />
                                    <br /> The next two panels are drawn in a stainless-glass fashion, depicting two archways. One archway is a depiction of an Indian woman, kneeling in isolation, around closed flowers. The other is a woman riding cowgirl a top of her lover as flowers bloom and hearts explode in abundance. around. Behind these two archways is a simplified marshmallow version of Alina who’s there to give these panels context through narration.<br /> 'In my Indian upbringing, having sex meant you had to be married. But it didn’t really shake out like that for me.'<br /> 'Folks, learn from my mistakes! Definitely get checked up before your IUD appointment if you haven’t already.'<br />
                                    <br /> The bottom of this page leads us back into the present as a friendly Doctor holds up a speculum.<br /> 'This shouldn’t hurt too bad.'<br /> A laying down Alina, responds meekly with, 'Well, at least it can’t hurt more than giving birth, ha ha.'<br />
                                    <br /> Suddenly, Alina is struck by red pain Sparks.<br /> 'I was totally unprepared for the pain I was about to be in.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> Four panels show abstractions of sparks, noises, tears, and scrunched-up Alina faces, as the IUD is inserted, out of view. The vibe check here is one of pain and uncomfortability.<br /> We cut to a smiling Doctor.<br /> 'All done! Now go forth and don’t multiply! You might feel a little bit, woozy, but you’ll be fine in a bit.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> The doctor continues as we see a small, wobbly broken Alina laying in a puddle of pain and blood. <br /> 'Now you can’t have any penetrative sex for seven days. You'll bleed for a few days, but if it hurts too much, please call us!'<br /> 'OK…' Alina dazily responds. <br /> 'Think you’re OK to go home?'<br /> 'Y-yeah, I think so.'<br />
                                    <br /> A grumpy-looking Alina is zooming by in the back of a taxi<br /> 'In the Uber back home, I felt like my insides were on fire. I’ve had some pretty painful period cramps before, but this was on another level. I felt like I couldn’t move without passing out.'<br />
                                    <br /> Alina weekly smiles towards us and the camera.<br /> 'But though I felt sick and dizzy, I was still elated. I felt so proud to finally take charge of my sexual health. As silly as it might sound, it made me feel like a real grown-up.'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br />
                                    <br /> A large panel takes up half the page. It shows a transitional Alina, moving from a red, small marshmallowy version of herself kneeling in pain, to a happy, joyous, running one before finally, a third Alina who is hugging herself in glee.<br /> 'My IUD adventure was so worth the pain. It was so liberating to push myself out of my comfort zone, and just go for it. It felt like the start of a new journey, being more mindful of my body's needs and taking care of it myself.'<br />
                                    <br /> We cut to Alina in bed underneath her blankets in front of her computer. On the other side of the computer, in cyberspace is her partner talking back. <br /> Floating around Alina's narration are hearts.<br /> 'I can’t wait to take this IUD for a spin with you!'<br /> 'Hey! You can’t have any PIV sex for seven days remember?' Responds the partner<br />
                                    <br /> Alina looks away rejected<br /> 'Oh yeah…'<br />
                                    <br /> The partner's face looks back with a smirk<br /> 'Do you know what that means though right?'<br />
                                    <br /> We see two marshmallowy versions of Alina and her partner, jumping and high-fiving in the air as they both shout<br /> 'Butt stuff!'<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page1<br /> An unassuming androgynous sailor of small stature, wearing a sailor's top and knee-high shorts, sits in a small rowing boat scribbling down on a piece of paper. Next to them, it’s a black bottle, and behind that an abstraction of the paper that is being written on.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Wish I May,<br /> wish I might…<br /> I wish…<br /> … For a vibrator that’s a delight!<br /> Something that I’ve never done,<br /> Something new, something fun!'<br />
                                    <br /> Our Sailor puts the poem into the bottle and throws it off the side of the boat<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> 'Ow! Hey! No littering!'<br /> Merperson Ripley appears from the water, rubbing their head.<br />
                                    <br /> The Sailor leaps back, and the boat rocks as Ripley leans up on it.<br /> Sailor 'Eep! Sorry!!'<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley 'No worries. Read your letter, by the way. Give this a go!'<br />
                                    <br /> We’re shown a panel of the sailor's hands, holding a very happy-looking starfish toy, it’s happy looking because it has a little face that's gleefully smiling away in the middle - adorable!<br /> Sailor 'Gasp! What’s this?'<br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Starts with a very large spread, showing off the Starsi by Cute Little Fuckers, in all of its glory. Floating around it are Merperson Ripley, and Sailor who is looking on with a questioning look as Ripley explains.<br /> Around this large, splash page are some of the toys details.<br />
                                    <br /> A unique vibrator fresh off the docs by Cute Little Fuckers.<br /> Starsi <br /> Rechargeable<br /> Waterproof<br /> 100% silicone<br /> 4.6"x1.3"<br /> $75<br /> Sailor 'cool!… How do I use it?'<br /> Ripley 'Any way you like!'<br />
                                    <br /> 'Ride it like a dolphin in the waves'<br /> We see a little fleshed-out Stick Figure of unassuming gender, dry humping a pillow with the Starsi on top of it. Water and waves splash up all around.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Cup your cod like a seashell bikini.'<br /> The Stick Figure is lying down with their shades on, on a towel in front of a crab that has question marks floating around them as they watch the Stick Figure rub the Starsi in between their legs.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Oar tickle some pickles with the diverse, tentacle vibes!'<br /> Stick figure is joined by a second Stick Figure, and underneath an umbrella on the beach they rub the Starsi on the other's nipples.<br />
                                    <br /> We’re back in the boat. Our Sailor is holding up the starfish-appearing toy in front of Ripley. Who is still floating in the water.<br /> Sailor 'Hm, sounds too good to be true, mysterious mer-person. What’s the catch?'<br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Ripley closes their eyes and lifts a webbed hand up to explain.<br /> 'Whale, it’s so different from your average vibe that you can’t really expect the same waves.'<br /> Sailor, 'I sea what you mean.'<br />
                                    <br /> 'YEE-OUCH Those tentacles are intense!' The sailor shouts suddenly.<br />
                                    <br /> We are shown a close-up of somebody using the toy in between their legs, lots of vibrator lines emanate from the tips of the toy. Ripley looks on with a mildly concerned mer-look as they describe the action.<br /> 'That was my experience! The tips get most of the vibes, and sting the inside of my thighs, like a jellyfish. Some folks may enjoy that, but I found it distracting at best, if not painful.'<br />
                                    <br /> 'Wait… thighs?' questions the Sailor, who quickly goes back to masturbating.<br /> 'OK, what about grinding? ...Yeah the vibes are just going to the tips. I’m getting nothing at the core, despite my clit being right on it! Wow, it’s so loud!'<br />
                                    <br /> Disappointed the Sailor slumps down on the side of the boat and hands the Starsi back to mer-Ripley.<br /> 'Sigh. Sorry, it’s just not doing it for me. This is a lovely pond skipper, but I need vibes as deep is the seven seas. What a tease!'<br /> 'That’s all right friend, we tried!' replies Ripley.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> The next panel is a depiction of the small rowing boat being picked up by a giant wave, followed by the bota at a standstill.<br /> Ripleys narration continues. 'Everyone says “it’s not the size of the boat that matters, it’s the motion of the ocean…“ '<br /> The sailor finishes the sentence '… But this guy doesn’t really move me! Boo.'<br />
                                    <br /> The sailor holds up the Stasi as compared to a more abstract goopy and soft version of itself, the OG Stassi has a label saying the original diameter, is 4.9 inches. The abstract one has a proposed diameter, 5.5 to 6 inches. Our Sailor looks on with a questioning look.<br /> 'Ironically, if it was bigger and softer, it might not dig into my thighs so bad! Maybe then the vibes with be deeper?'<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley holds up their Sea-Phone, you can tell it comes from the seat because it looks like a crustacean!<br /> 'The Art on the listing actually made it seem twice as big! Kind of a let-down.'<br /> The sailor is surprised, 'Wow! It even looks squisher!'<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley continues surrounded by floating toys of all different kinds.<br /> 'There are a lot of good ideas here, and Starsí is well on its way to being a totally unique fish in a sea of identical vibrators. But in its current form, it’s just not what we’re looking for right now.'<br />
                                    <br /> The sailor holds up their arm and exasperation as Ripley tosses over a magic wand, a much larger and traditional deep vibrator.<br /> Sailor 'And right now… I’m still horny!'<br /> Ripley, 'back to basics!'<br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The comic ends with a big and beautiful one-full-page panel of Ripley diving deep under the sea with the Starsí. Up above we see the rowboat vibrating away as the sailor takes care of their leftover business.<br />
                                    <br /> As Ripley floats down to the bottom to place the Starsi in a place next to many other sex toys, finishing their collection, they narrate.<br /> 'Oh Starsi… You might not float my boat yet, but you’ve already made a real splash. And someone out there loves you just the way you are. Your tentacles are perfect for foreplay, and anyone with hand mobility issues would find your shape so cozy. I’m looking forward to what your future holds, you Cute Little Fucker!'<br />

                                <br /> My Aussies who are looking to grab one of these <a href="https://t.cfjump.com/60209/t/29682?Url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lovehoney.com.au%2fsex-toys%2fbutt-plugs%2fvibrating-butt-plugs%2fp%2fb-vibe-remote-control-rechargeable-vibrating-rimming-butt-plug%2fa34813g63047.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">beauties for themselves (Aus link)</a>, you <em>might </em>get a black remote like the one I drew in the comic instead of a white one on the box cover. There <em>might </em>be a note saying you can’t open the remote control to check or replace the battery and can only get the whole thing replaced by mail, which really confused me when I got my unit!</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>I’ve spoken to b-Vibe</strong> and I was told this was a quick fix due to an untimely change in the Australian child safety compliance law regarding coin battery-powered devices. <strong>Long story short (kinda),</strong> it IS safe to open your remote control as long as you’re being cautious of any kids around who could potentially choke on the removable parts! Sex toys should be out of their reach to begin with in any case! Thank you to the good folks at b-Vibe for the review unit and for helping me with this particular Australian confusion!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> Today's comic starts with a large, chibbi panel of the artist and reviewer, Hien Pham, who's eyes are wide, and wet, looking at the camera. Hien is a CIS heavier-set man of color with thinning, but elegantly pulled back into-a-bun hair, that pairs with a mighty beard and mustache to boot. He’s dressed in white and wears glasses. As he looks at us and the camera, he's at the verge of crying, grasping at his chin he exclaims...<br /> 'I wanna get eaten out!!'<br />
                                    <br /> Hien turns away, wiping tears with a handkerchief.<br /> 'Alas, no person has yet to fulfill this rim job vacancy… I can’t help but wonder… Is there a toy out there eager to get in on this back-door opportunity?'<br /> Behind him at the door, a blurry, purple figure rings the doorbell <br /> 'Ding dong!'<br />
                                    <br /> The rest of this page is filled up with a huge illustration of a giant butt plug.<br /> Title:<br /> b-Vibe Rimming Plug Petite <br />
                                    <br /> A large purple toy with little segments x-rayed across to show bead and vibrations in the plug , sits surrounded by details <br /> Remote control with coin battery included <br /> Splash proof, USB rechargeable insertable 10 cm of silicon plug! <br /> 3.8 inches 9.8 cm insertable length. <br /> Vibrating motor in the tip <br /> Why discuss 3.6 cm or 1.4 inches diameter <br /> Rotating beads in the shaft <br /> US$160  AU$120 <br />
                                    <br /> A tiny Hien looks on with hearts in his eyes.<br /> 'Thank you b-Vibe for sending me a unit for this review!'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Hien is now next to a fictional character, who lacks a gender or sexuality, but I'm (Matthew Nolan who's transcribing this) gonna call them Mullet on account of their cool-looking mullet. Mullet is tanned, heavy set, nude, and comes with a peen! They're also rocking a little beard. Hien has passed the toy onto his newfound friend and is looking away in mild embarrassment. <br /> 'Admittedly, my first go around with the petite did not go so well… I’m still a beginner at anal, and I really struggled with the petite's girth!'<br /> Mullet touches the toy <br /> 'I’ll give it a try.'<br />
                                    <br /> The next panel has a big red X across it as Mullet rushes to put the toy inside of themselves<br /> 'Almost… Oow ow owo ow ow-'<br /> A tiny Hien Jumps in with his arms making an X. Laying next to him is Mullet; defeated, with their ass in the air and half a plug in their butt. <br /> 'Do not do this!'  Hein shouts!<br /> 'Excitement aside, it’s important to know your limit! If it’s painful going in, getting it out, will be way worse!'<br />
                                    <br /> The next three panels are illustrated with a marshmallow version of Mullet, basically a floating ass with a face, it’s pretty adorable and fun. We see this marshmallow take fingers toys before exploding happily and vibrating. Covering it are three narrative boxes of Hien's thoughts and notes.<br />
                                    <br /> 'Warm up with plenty of lube and your fingers! Stretch patiently.'<br /> 'Push it in slow and steady. Pause when it gets uncomfortable! Never force it!'<br /> 'Turn it on! Enjoy the vibrations while you’re loosening up!'<br />
                                    <br /> Mullet sits back with a content look and adds,<br /> 'Seriously, it took me half an hour to work the petite in…'<br />
                                    <br /> Hien excitedly jumps in front.<br /> 'But! Once it’s in the real fun begins!'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3.<br />
                                    <br /> We see the toy inside of a abstract butt and we see the pearls that must be inside the toy rotating. Hien narration flows over the informative illustration that follow.<br /> 'The rotating beads gave me this present, repeated flickering sensation! I have not experienced a real tongue, but it did feel like what I imagined a lick would be!'<br /> Hien draws hands and fingers, flicking and bapping together<br />
                                    <br /> 'Out of the 7 available shaft rotation patterns, only a couple really stood out to me… But, I really loved how much they spiced up the tip's more standard vibrating patterns!'<br /> We are showing the graph of escalating and changing patterns and vibrations overtime.<br />
                                    <br /> 'When my sphincter was relaxed, the sensations were more spread out and subdued. When I tightened up, I could really feel the spinning beads pushing up against my butt!'<br /> We are shown an adorable set of diagrams of the same butt with the toy inside of it, where one is relaxed, and the toy's vibrations are chill and dispersed. While on the other end is a butt that's clenched and the vibrations are localized and intense.<br /> 'There was a real sweet spot between clenching and relaxing, where the vibrations pulsed throughout my whole anus!'<br />
                                    <br /> Mullet reappears, wriggling in happiness.<br /> 'I found myself tightening and relaxing again, and again, just to hit that sweet spot… aaaahh… Again!'<br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> Little Hien looks contemplatively to the side.<br /> 'Like I said before, I’ve never been rimmed… So I can’t really compare the petite to a real tongue…'<br />
                                    <br /> In the next panel, we’re showing a dark-skinned, older person with greying hair, going to town and eating some big and lightly haired booty. Above it is more narration.<br /> 'In theory, a personal rimmer can really switch up the intensity and frequency of the rimming! Plus, they can pleasure the area outside of the 'bud!'<br />
                                    <br /> Now we’re shown another big beautiful butt and peen being spread and lifted, the toy sits happily in this character's butt as it vibes away.<br /> 'The Petite's more consistent, more persistent. It stimulates tirelessly from the inside! You also get the extra vibration at his tip!'<br />
                                    <br /> A new(?) third character is lying in bed and seemingly is receiving some lovely butt-eating pleasure the cameras focus on their bearded face, (I wanna say it's Mullet, but it might not be!), Narration continues the scene.<br /> 'Personally, when I’m with a partner, it’s the magnificent, intimate energy that defines the experience. When I’m using toys, I find myself more attuned to my own body, to my own physical sensations.'<br />
                                    <br /> Now we’re shown the toy being washed as the sexy scene finishes, and the characters presumably take a rest.<br /> 'For me, these are uniquely different, non-mutually exclusive experiences. One doesn’t truly replace the other, and they both work to inform and inspire pleasure!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5.<br />
                                    <br /> Hien puts his hands together, closes his eyes, and takes a breath as he starts to conclude his review.<br /> 'So… Do I recommend the b-Vibe Rimming Plug Petite?'<br />
                                    <br /> We cut back to Mullet, sat playing with themselves, while looking at their phone, next to them is a lonely-looking butt plug.<br /> Hien continues his narration over the top.<br /> 'Where my body's at, I tend to prefer more spontaneous play out of toys. I don’t always have 30 minutes to warm up to the petite. It’s hard to see myself using as much as I’d like.'<br />
                                    <br /> Hien is now drawn holding the Petite up to his head and there are hearts coming out from both of them.<br /> 'And yet, I really did love how the Petite made me feel! It was such an accomplishment when I worked up to its girth, and it gives love to such an aft-overlooked area by other toys!'<br />
                                    <br /> Hien draws three plugs side-by-side. We have an extra large, menacing-looking plug, and on the other side, the tiny petite we've grown to know and love throughout this review!<br /> 'In the long run, I can see the petite being a really valuable investment in anal training and having fun at the same time!'<br /> A tiny Hien holds onto the bottom of a giant b-Vibe as it flies through space happily vibing away, as Hien concluded his comic. <br /> 'Bottom line, if you see few issues with the size, and you have the resources to invest in the versatility of your rosebud… The whole b-Vibe Rimming Plug line is definitely worth your consideration.'<br />
                                    <br /> Today's comic was made by Hien Pham who can be found at hienpham.artstation.com<br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 01/22/23 who doesn't really know how to transcribe things, but is trying his most darnest.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">PAGE 1<br /> In a medieval merchant room filled with fantasy treasures, bottles, and books, two people stand examining a mandrake root. The Knight holding the person-shaped creature is a white woman with long black braided hair, wearing a Knight's uniform in pastel blue colors with a long coat. The Merchant beside her, is a white nonbinary person with brown hair and shaved off sides, they're wearing a long coat in pastel blue colors. Todays comic is awash in similar pastels and hues, hand drawn and flowy, with a colorful aesthetic.<br />
                                    <br /> "Welcome back to my humble warehouse." The Merchant greets The Knight. "Feel free to look around."<br />
                                    <br /> "No way!" The Knight exclaims in surprise as she picks up humanoid mandrake root from the table. "I still remember this thing. Wasn't easy to get. The nettles..."<br /> "You know..." Interjects The Merchant as he guides her hands to set the magical root back on the table. "All of this wouldn't be possible without you. I really appreciate your work." She looks at him coyly. <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> "Mhm, is that right?" She asks, and then her eye is caught by a beautiful crystal that is somewhat bigger than a hand. "Ah, so..." She picks it up and examines it close to her eye. "The Queen requested this one, right? What's it for?" <br /> "It's a tool for pleasure." Explains The Merchant. "When two or more have a connection with each other, it's meant to increase it."<br /> "Maybe..." The Knight looks slyly at The Merchant. "We should make sure it works?"<br /> "You are right." The Merchant agrees, perhaps a little too readily. "It's for the Queen after all. Wouldn't want to disappoint her."<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> As The Merchant places his hand on the arm of The Knight that is holding the crystal, they purr, "No one is going to look for us here..." <br />
                                    <br /> "Aahh!" Exhales The Knight as the Merchant takes the jewel from her hand and kisses her on the cheek. The jewel glimmers, magic building up from it. <br /> As The Knight opens up her shirt The Merchant asks, "What do you feel?"<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br /> "It's warm and tingly." The Knight coos. "I'd say it works."<br /> As The Merchant presses it against her breast, he ponders aloud, "I wonder how it would feel... Elsewhere."<br /> "You know..." The Knight grins and gasps as The Merchant slides down from our view. "I appreciate your work as well."<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> Now we cut to the throne room with The Queen, a black cisgender woman with short black hair, wearing a crown and a blue long dress with an ombré. The Merchant and The Knight stand before her.<br /> "Huh..." She says looking disappointed and unimpressed as she examines the dull, gray crystal in her hand. "Pretty sure this one's empty... Care to explain?" She asks her sheepish and playfully-embarrassed Merchant and Knight who cannot make eye contact with her.<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">page 1<br /> Today’s comic is colored in oranges and purples lending a warmth to this comic by Kiwi. The comic starts outside of a coffee shop. Our Protagonist looks in, dressed in a tank top and skirt with knee-high socks and orange little shoes. Their hair is done up in a small bun and they carry a purse.<br />
                                    <br /> Our protagonist looks at their phone, raising it to the coffee shop window in front of them, comparing an old digital photo from years ago to what they see now in front of them. The photo is of a boys volleyball semi-final team and four assumedly-male children ready to compete. Three of the people look confident and happy, while one looks anxious while trying to fit in with the happy vibe. Behind the phone photo, in real life, are three masculine-appearing characters waiting in a coffee shop. They are the children from the picture, but now in their teens or twenties and missing one. It is apparent that the missing person from the group picture is our Protagonist, who is holding the phone.<br />
                                    <br /> With a deep breath and putting their phone away, Protagonist walks into the coffee shop, thinking to themselves ‘Shouldn’t have worn the skirt…’<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> ‘H-hey guys’ they say aloud as they approach the table. <br />
                                    <br /> The sitting trio look on in amazement and surprise.<br /> ‘Hey, there you are! Long time no see’ says one of the characters who is dark skinned and wearing a Hawaiian Shirt.<br /> ‘Come, take a seat!’ Says another, a fair skinned character who's dressed up a little bit in dark tight clothing, with long hair covering their eyes, it appears a little Goth'y to Matthew (who's transcribing this, so I'll use that term to describe them!)<br /> A third, lightly-dark-toned character, dressed a little like a skaterboi, in a beanie, sits drinking their coffee, nervously sweating.<br />
                                    <br /> Our protagonist sits down, as the Goth character continues on ‘Have you played the new Pikman yet?’ <br /> ‘Only a little!’ Protagonist replies<br /> ‘Man, I’m addicted!’<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br />
                                    <br /> The conversation continues between the three, with Protagonist appearing to be a little left out, and withdrawn as they stare at their coffee nervously. A little bit of time seems to have passed.<br /> Eventually, Hawaiian Shirt notices Protagonist's withdrawal and chirps up ‘Hey, cool outfit by the way. My boyfriend has a similar aesthetic.’<br /> Our protagonist looks on with surprise ‘Really?’<br />
                                    <br /> Goth picks up the conversation ‘ Yeah! You’re definitely owning it.’<br /> ‘Thank you…’ Protagonist nervously replies, with a growing blush.<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 4<br />
                                    <br /> Skaterboi, who has yet to say anything, stares for a while before Protagonist finally notices, and as soon as they make eye contact Skaterboi looks away.<br />
                                    <br /> We see a thought bubble coming from Protagonist, wondering ‘Why is he staring? Fuck, I look weird, don’t I?’ Before saying out loud, ‘Sorry.’<br />
                                    <br /> Hawaiian and Goth look on with question marks surrounding them, before they share a look. <br /> Goth leans over the table to poke Skaterboi ‘Something on your mind, man? Why so quiet?’<br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br />
                                    <br /> Skaterboi drops his face to the table ‘Ugh!’ Before looking up in embarrassment ‘It’s just shocking –‘<br />
                                    <br /> ‘I didn’t expect them to be so cute, OK?!’ <br /> Protagonist's eyes widen in surprise  ‘huh???’<br />
                                    <br /> Finally, the penny has dropped, Hawaiian Shirt roars back ‘ahahaha you dork!’ Goth lols to themself, and Sk8er Boi turns his head away in mild blushing embarrassment. Beaming in the corner is Protagonist. ‘Maybe it’s not so bad to wear a skirt’ they think to themsellf as the comic ends.<br />
                                    <br /> Today's delightful, short comic and shared moment was written and drawn by Kiwi! And then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on January 8th 2024.

                                <div id="transcript-content">A white cis character, with pronouns she/her, named Jack, leans over and gently touches her partner, Sebastian, a tanned but visibly bruised, cis character with he/him pronouns. Both are middle-aged and naked!<br />
                                    <br /> ‘Would you like some water? Food?’ Jack asks.<br />
                                    <br /> The next panel crops in closer as they touch.<br /> Sebastian ‘Water’<br /> Jack ‘Of course.’<br /> ‘… Sorry if I was too rough…’ She looks down with a little bit of sadness and some mild growing confusion surrounding her head.<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian ‘What? You are perfect.’<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian notices Jack getting further confused and desperate, a dark cloud surrounds her head with swirls.<br /> Sebastian ‘…Hey. Are you OK?’<br />
                                    <br /> The page drifts and we see a narrative box that states 'Earlier that week…’<br />
                                    <br /> The comic cuts back to the pair, at a different time and location, they’re sat with a notebook and coffee, in front of them both. Jack is scribbling down notes as she listens.<br /> Jack ‘… Thanks for tolerating me and my notes. I want the scene to be better than the last one.’<br />
                                    <br /> ‘About that… There is one thing we could work on' Sebastian mentions.<br /> ‘Oh, yeah?’ Retorts Jack.<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian continues ‘ we forgot about your aftercare! And you dropped so hard last time, remember?’<br /> ‘… I thought I was just tired…’<br /> ‘… And grumpy. And spacey. And… Well… Well, we can make it better.’<br /> ‘ But… I’m the Dom. Dom's don’t need Aftercare…’<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian points to the notebook ‘Of course they do! This is what I need at the end of a scene to find myself… It’s no crime to design your own version.’<br />
                                    <br /> He then reaches to hold Jack’s hand, ‘I want to be as good a sub for you, as you are a Dom to me, so let’s avoid the Dom Drop’<br />
                                    <br /> Jack lifts their coffee up while wearing a very surprised face ‘I’ve never heard of Dom Drop.’<br /> ‘Yeah me neither till recently. Breaking away from the intense emotional vulnerability can be disorientating and distressing. Like an adrenaline crash.’<br />
                                    <br /> Jack’s pinching their lips in thought, ‘Ha… I focus so much on making sure it’s good for you while trying to stay in character… Makes sense.’<br /> Sebastian ‘ and there’s some crossover with Sub Drop, too. Shame, guilt, inner turmoil, lethargy, etc.’<br />
                                    <br /> ‘I did feel gross for the rest of that day! Like I'd done something wrong.’ Jack exclaims.<br /> ‘Right! That’s the normal you clashing with your Dom persona.’<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian reaches over and gently squeezes Jack’s arm ‘You are not a kink–dispensing machine.’<br /> ‘Not for this scene anyway’ Jack teasingly whispers, while Sebastian continues.<br /> ‘Dom's deserve Aftercare, too. You’re human and have the right to be nurtured.’<br />
                                    <br /> ‘You’re right, I’m already less stressed about the scene were planning’<br /> ‘I’m glad ! So what does your Aftercare look like?’<br />
                                    <br /> We zoom in on the notepad in front of them both, Sebastian charge and is now the one to take notes. <br /> ‘… Cuddles? Reassurance that I didn’t hurt you?’<br /> ‘Done. Anything else?’<br /> ‘Maybe… Call me by my name and not by my Dom title?’<br /> ‘Absolutely’ <br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian keeps jotting down notes as Jack continues.<br /> ‘How about a cookie and some juice? Like after donating blood!’<br />
                                    <br /> The camera starts to pan back, and leave the room, we see just small silhouettes of the two of them sitting at a coffee table as they start to finish this conversation.<br /> Sebastian ‘It’s not too late to turn this into a naughty nurse seen.’<br /> ‘ha! No..’ replies Jack.<br />
                                    <br /> A long line depicts the change in time and place. We're back to the present, as we see a naked and confused Jack looking at her hand, distantly a voice speaks out.<br /> ‘ Are you OK?’ ‘...Jack?’<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian appears next to Jack, wearing a friendly smile, as he gently touches Jack’s cheek. She responds with a weak smile.<br /> ‘… Yeah. I’m OK. Cuddle time?’<br />
                                    <br /> Sebastian ‘Of course! Cookie?’<br /> ‘Oh, my God, yes.’  <br /> The comic ends with the pair embraced on the bed, grinning and happily holding one another.<br />

                                <strong>Hien’s Notes:</strong>
                                <br /> 2023 has been the year I learned to show up for myself more so than ever before. This little ritual I made up has become a really important and powerful tool for me to check in with myself, to validate, regulate, and to process my Big Emotions (of which I have plenty, haha!). The first time I really sat down and said <em>“I see you hurting”</em> felt like such a cathartic revelation. I hope you can feel seen and comforted in this particularly turbulent time. Take care, and take it easy, everyone! I’ll see you next year!<br /> P.S: the comic is titled after a song by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAgmyLIjq3A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gretta Ray</a> whose album, Positive Spin, I really enjoyed this year!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> The comic opens on a bedroom at night, Hein Pham, a cis gay asian man, lays half undressed, looks up and around his room as he remembers some thing painfull from his past. As the first few panels progress we have developing narration from Hein.<br />
                                    <br /> Hein “I fall hard. And I fall fast.”<br /> “When my heart breaks, it breaks twice as bad.”<br /> “I try to run away from it in my head… I always try…”<br />
                                    <br /> The flashbacks Hein experiences are one of rejection, we see his hand, reach out to another person who turns their back to him. The final panel on this page has a ghost Hien sitting up and leaving his laying down body as he disassociates.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> The ghost-Hien runs away from his laying body in a panic, and an attempt to leave this painful memory behind. <br /> “But when my heart breaks, it breaks twice as fast.”<br />
                                    <br /> Ghost Hien grabs at his chest in pain<br /> “fuck… FUCK!!!”<br />
                                    <br /> He Keels over, and on his hands and knees says out loud<br /> “I don’t want to feel like this… I…”<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3 <br /> A second set of hands reach out from the beyond, gently grasping Ghost Hein's crying head. THe hands belong to a second Ghost Hein, a calm and loving one. <br /> “I see you. I see you hurting.”<br />
                                    <br /> The second Ghost hugs, the first heartbroken one as he crys in the embrace.<br /> “I am so sorry.”<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> “Let’s practice something”<br /> Says the second Hein as he sits down next to his mirror self.<br />
                                    <br /> “The next time you feel unwanted… Like your yearning for a hand to hold goes unanswered… When your heart breaks, and all you can do is run away… I will hold your hand. Like this. And we can sit with it together.”<br /> As he talks this Hein, gently grasps the hand of the other and squeezes.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5 <br /> We see the the hand squeeze again, a mirror image to previous visual, but this time the coloring shows' that we’re back in the dark room of Hein's bedroom as he remarks to himself<br /> “when it passes… it always passes… My heart will heal… Twice as glad.”<br />
                                    <br /> The comic comes to an end with a teary but smiling Hein holding his own hand and sitting up. Outside the blinds it looks like the sun is rising.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Today's comic was made by Hien Pham who can be found at hienpham.artstation.com<br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 12/24/23 who struggled to capture the amazing visuals, but tried his best!<br /> Oh Joy Sex Toy is paid for and supported by Patreon, and we'd ask for any support you can give us to keep making them for 2024!<br /> https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">
                                    <br /> Page one starts with a beautifully rendered picture of the statue of Saint Teeresa, holding an arrow made of golden light. The narration covers this comic and it’s all drawn in blues and yellows with characters looking very classical and statue-like.<br /> Narration “When I first saw the Ecstasy of Saint Theresa I knew that Angel was you”<br />
                                    <br /> “That was your soft face, your curves, in marble."<br /> We see a pretty face! Followed by the X and Y symbol.<br /> “The world seems to have its own idea of what a boy is.”<br />
                                    <br /> A curvy, statuesque figure lays in a bed with wings.<br /> “But it’s you. It’s us.”<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> The statuesque figure is natural drawn and a little more human and alive now. He's a curvy trans man sitting in the bathtub, radiating yellow glows like a religious painting<br /> “I know you think it’s silly when I snap photos of you in the bath-”<br />
                                    <br /> “-in bed-”<br /> The person is now lying back in bed. He's rolled over so that we can see his butt, as he spoons a plushy! He quickly gets up and stands out of bed in some PJs while checking the phone.<br /> “-lounging unposed-”<br />
                                    <br /> In a similar position, this person is now dressed in armor and flowing garments, regal and classical, holding a sword. <br /> “But you look truly classical. The culmination of every God, Saint, and angel I studied in our history.”<br />
                                    <br /> The angelic figure is joined by another, the scene is intimate as the newcomer lovingly grasps the angel's breast<br /> “Please, pierce me with your arrow."<br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> “Alone in this room, we can be completely ourselves. There are no boundaries to what a boy is here.”<br /> The naked figures embrace and lay down, as if about to kiss, they are angelic with their wings, and halos.<br />
                                    <br /> The two bodies start to drip and sweat in delight<br /> “ We know a boy is breasts, curves, and wet flesh.”<br />
                                    <br /> We see golden leaves, falling away from the clouds<br /> “A boy melts into his lover and treasures the divinity he finds.”<br />
                                    <br /> The camera pulls back, for a close-up of their faces and we see the two of them kiss<br /> "Thank you for filling me up. Thank you for letting me in.”<br /> Page 4<br />
                                    <br /> The two fall asleep in the clouds, one holding the other's head, while he contemplates.<br /> “In the afterward, I think about how the world is missing out. In their search for the impossible, they try to render us invisible.”<br />
                                    <br /> The camera pulls back again, and we see the first angelic character again laying down in cloud-like pillows, surrounded by gold, as the narrator starts to finish the comic “But no set of rules or standards can rival what faith reveals.”<br />
                                    <br /> “Because if you aren’t a boy, then they must not exist at all.”<br /> The comic ends with the two of them, now, very much statuesque one holding the other's head in their hand.<br />
                                    <br /> --<br />
                                    <br /> Today's wonderfully poetic comic was written and drawn by Em Hoover who can be found at https://www.emhoover.com/<br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 12/18/23 who tried his best to capture a bit of the magic Em was putting down!<br />

                        <p>To help you… we’ve been busy updating a lot of the older comic’s into a newer <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/split_page_format/">Split Page Format</a> so they’d be easier to else elsewhere! It’s not always obvious to notice, but these comics have been split apart into nice re-postable comic pages – we just use fancy html to hide the excess – but all the pages are there on the page. Right click and View Image in Tab and you should be able to see what we mean!</p>

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> The comic opens on a wide shot, looking out on a fantasy tower, set in some deep thick woods. smoke billows from the top.<br />
                                    <br /> ‘You need my what?' booms a voice from inside. <br /> 'Don’t laugh – it’s for my potions class!'<br />
                                    <br /> The camera enters the room, and in front of us is a feminine, appearing non-binary witch, dressed in a loose green top and tight brown pants. Behind them a dark-furred and heavy-set Minotaur in a loincloth.<br /> Minotaur ‘Ha! What in the world are they teaching you at that witch college?’<br /> Witch 'You know how it goes. Magic has all kinds of strange rules.' they reply as they look for appropriately sized vials and bottles.<br />
                                    <br /> Our witch turns around with a soft smile 'You don’t mind helping me do you?'<br /> Minotaur 'Snort! For you, anything. And I dare say this is my specialty. Though…'<br />
                                    <br /> The camera shows a recipe list filled with icons:<br /> mushrooms times six,<br /> mortal and pestle seven,<br /> Minotaur droplet times 30.<br /> The Minotaur continues on  ‘Not that I’m complaining, but wouldn't it be easier if I just rub one out for you?’<br />
                                    <br /> A sweet 'No' with a heart attached appears from in between his legs, as the witch, takes their position.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> We see the Minotaur‘s butt and his tail wagging <br /> 'Heh...' he says, 'Alright then, you don’t have to ask me twice!'<br />
                                    <br /> The camera focuses on the Minotaur’s face for the next few panels as the witch talks to him from between his legs.<br /> Witch 'It’s important to harvest ingredients juuuuuuust right, the quality of the potion depends on it entirely! A petrification potion in this case, it could turn out com-'<br /> The Minotaur grows frustrated and reaches down into his loincloth to pull out his substantial-looking cock <br /> ‘Hey, nerd,’<br /> 'Enough with all the theory, time to get to work.'<br />
                                    <br /> He 'Whap's' his cock against the witch's face, who absolutely loves it.<br /> Witch, 'Yes, sir.' -heart!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> The witch tosses the Minotaur‘s loincloth away. He looks on with a 'whoa!'<br />
                                    <br /> The next few panels show the witch doing some really good blow job work, slurping and humming and hawing all over Minotaur's cock. <br /> After a few sexy sloppy BJ panels, we cut to behind the minotaur in a full backside panel, positioned just so we can also see the witch’s groin, as they kneel in between Minotaur's legs. There is a teeny tiny little heart coming from the witch's groin, and they're starting to tent a boner. <br /> Minotaur 'Fuck… You’re pretty good at this, aren’t you? Did you study this too… Or are you just a natural at sucking cock?'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> We see a very sweet panel with the witch winking up at the Minotaur as they kiss the tip of Minotaur cock. <br /> Minotaur softly gasps 'fuck… I’m almost… Witch looks up at him 'Hmmm?'<br /> What was that … big boy?<br /> As the witch says, big boy, a little heart laser beam shoots past the Minotaur’s face:<br />
                                    <br /> Minotaur shouts out 'OH FUCK-!and comes all over the witch's face as they gleefully watch.<br />
                                    <br /> The camera pulls back, and we see the Minotaur soft now, and scratching his face with the witch in between his legs. It's obvious they'd forgotten to have him shoot into a bottle instead!<br /> Minotaur 'whoops...<br /> Witch 'well… Guess we’ll have to try that again!'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5.<br />
                                    <br /> We are in a lecture hall, filled with witches' hats everybody’s chittering and chattering.<br /> Some of the background conversations are <br /> 'Potions is so hard though…'<br /> 'Did you finish your essay on transportation spells?'<br /> 'My familiar ate my homework…'<br /> 'Want to go to the star dance together?'<br /> Above it all the teacher down below shouts out 'Next, please!'<br />
                                    <br /> A white cloudy potion is displayed with a 'big ta da' <br /> Witch 'here it is, my petrification potion!'<br />
                                    <br /> A grey-haired teacher dressed in dark purples studies it as the witch stands there proudly beaming.<br />
                                    <br /> The teacher picks it up, and examines it ever closer, with a thoughtful gaze.<br /> Teacher; 'It is rather cloudy… <br /> How many Minotaur tears did you use?'<br />
                                    <br /> Our witch is STRUCK by a red starburst surround - as they are dazed by what the teacher just said. Sweating and covered in shadow our witch ends the comic with a 'T…. Tears?!!'<br />
                                    <br /> And that’s it for today’s comic. This comic was super fun to work on and was made by Nousanti an incredibly talented artist that you should go check out right this second! They can be found at https://twitter.com/nousanti It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 12/11/23 who muddle his way through this by dictating the whole comic into his phone. <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Hien Pham is drawn as a wooly furry anthropomorphic male, cis gay bear, in this dark and blue autobiographical comic! The comic opens with him looking at a carnival-style attraction, depicting an octopus whipping a very happy cow. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien Narrates throughout this comic, alongside visual depictions.<br /> Hien: 'I went to a kinky event recently! One outside of my usual circles… Which I was quite nervous about.'<br />
                                    <br /> The camera shows Hien, dressed and roped about to enter the event.<br /> 'I was afraid I wasn’t kinky enough, even though I had spent hours putting on a Shibari harness of my own design.'<br />
                                    <br /> A sweating nervous Hien signs some forms in front of a wolf-welcomer.<br /> 'Before heading in, we were asked to sign terms and conditions to protect everyone’s privacy! This entire comic has been fictionalized for that very purpose!'<br />
                                    <br /> Hien runs into a Bull who happily chitty-chats.<br /> 'Afterward, a staff member came up and complimented me on my rope work!<br /> The exchange quickly reminded me that I’m amongst kindred spirits.'<br />
                                    <br /> And then run's into a wolf friend dressed to the nines, wearing netting, piercings, and a chest harness! The wolf waves his buddy over!<br /> 'By the time I found a friend to tag along with, my anxiety was extinguished, and I was excited for the rest of the night!'<br />
                                    <br /> Page 2 is a FULL page illustration of a look down at a where-waldo-style depiction of the event! There are little kinky furs everywhere! From Shrew to Fox everyone's here, happy to be poking around and exploring the space. It's adorable, sexy and gosh I want to go! <br />
                                    <br /> Subtitles with text cover the smorgasbord of details.<br /> Dungeon space<br /> Hey, folks sign up for sensory experiences, spankings, and all manner of kinky play!<br />
                                    <br /> Local makers<br /> Going through here reminds me of wanting to get my ears pierced, but I’m still scared of the pain and maintenance…<br />
                                    <br /> Bar area<br /> Themed drinks and cocktails! I don’t drink, so I just got a pint of lemonade and drank water out of it the whole night.<br />
                                    <br /> Gear exhibition<br /> A showcase of different game materials, like leather, Robert, spandex, and more! Made me want to write a comic about Jabari rope textures!<br />
                                    <br /> Performance stage<br /> This was the highlight of the night! My friends and I spent most of our time here, watching with staring eyes!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3 and things are getting saucy, we are now back in the room with Hien as he watches a polar bear do some Burlesque.<br /> 'We got to see some incredible burlesque! I wasn’t super familiar with the art form, but I sat awestruck and cheered the entire time.'<br />
                                    <br /> We're shown some fire-play on an arm, and a close-up of a corset, before we dive into an intimate moment between a Hare and their dommy bear. One aggressively licking/kissing the other. Rope and ties abound!<br /> 'The performer's confidence was so electric infectious that I couldn’t help but appreciate my own body that much more.'<br />
                                    <br /> 'More daring ask involving edge play like breath control all had content warnings announced beforehand.'<br />
                                    <br /> 'There’s always a degree of care, deeply infused and kink and fetish that really speaks to me.'<br />
                                    <br /> 'And nothing spoke to me more than the Shibari performances'<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4 starts as the hare is roped, kissed, and hoisted up into the air. A small Hien watches in Awe, as this celebration of body and partnership is performed.<br /> 'I started crying within the first minutes of the act, and I could not stop.<br /> The aftercare I was going to wreck me.'<br />
                                    <br /> 'The emotional core of Shibari is all about surrender. A trust fall elaborated.<br /> Something I’ve never quite done.'<br />
                                    <br /> Hien's face is covered in tears, as he watches the two performers intimately kiss.<br /> 'What does it feel like?<br /> To know that everything is going to be OK in the end?'<br />
                                    <br /> Page 5 starts, with lighter and bright panels and jovial spirited fur's amuck! A raccoon and hyena have a light whip touch them and are delighted. <br /> 'Kink and fetish, to me, feel like a process of falling. A process of falling in love with my body, and all the things that can experience.'<br />
                                    <br /> A chicken and separate hyena GASP, as they watch a big butt, get smacked in front of them<br /> 'It’s a process of falling out of shame, and it’s a pleasure. I’ve letting guilt full away from desire.'<br />
                                    <br /> We snap to Bear Hien talking with a Buffalo who's holding the leash to a tied-up and blindfolded raccoon.<br /> 'It’s hard to believe it’s only been two years since I started falling.<br /> I’m thankful for the friends who continue to show me how to feel safe, saying, and consensually.'<br />
                                    <br /> The comic ends on Hien's big bear face, closed-eyed in glee.<br /> 'I’m having a great time, and I’m in no particular hurry to land.'<br />
                                    <br /> Today's comic was made by Hien Pham who can be found at hienpham.artstation.com<br /> It was then transcribed by Matthew Nolan on 12/04/23 who's still just trying his best at transcribing things!<br />

                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> Ripley LaCross looks pensively and with a little worry on their face. They wear a kerchief around their neck and a wide-brimmed hiking hat, along with a camping backpack. They are deep in the woods.<br /> Around them, the narrator says, "The term Trans Joy has appeared often in my travels, and just as often I've wondered... How does conscious and authentic joy feel in an increasingly cruel world? After nearly a decade of indecision that watched me slide toward rock bottom... This month marks my 2-year anniversary of starting HRT." <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley stands at a fork in the path, with signposts pointing in opposite directions. The narrator continues, "The anniversary of taking control of how I love myself."<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley sets off at a trot to the right, with the narrator stating, "And barreling down the path to find my true self."<br /> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /> A pink banner obscures part of the page with the text, "Read the rest on ohjoysextoy.com"<br /> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> As Ripley reviews a handful of maps, the narration goes on, "Reading trans blogs and forums for nearly seven years prepared me for the odyssey I was embarking on. At least, I thought they had."<br />
                                    <br /> Chewing on a food bar, Ripley sits on a cushion under a tree, one leg outstretched as they mull over the maps. "They wrote about milestones. About embracing identities. And blossoming self-confidence. So, I wrote too. Page after page of my whys... My what ifs... And my if onlys." <br />
                                    <br /> Ripley looks out at the horizon, full of tree tops and further hills. "In the end, they all boiled down to one single question: Where is the true me?" <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 3<br /> "A few weeks into treatment, answers appeared around the bend." The narrator states over the next series of images. <br /> Ripley looks up smiling as the sun casts shadows on their face, the narration stating, "I found myself... smiling more."<br /> As a river of small frogs fills the path, Ripley crouches low close to them in delight, holding their cheeks as they smile and laugh. "Laughing more."<br /> Covered in sweat, Ripley pulls off their hat and takes a chug from their water bottle. "Caring for myself more."<br />
                                    <br /> In a single panel, four versions of Ripley cross the distance. On the furthest left they are sweating and painting, struggling with exhaustion. The back of their head is closely buzzed while their bangs and side locks hang down from under the brim of their hat. As they progress across the middle of the panel, Ripley loses the hat and proceeds to walk more upright, sweating less with each step. Their locks of hair grow out (while remaining buzzed on the sides) until they have a mini-pony tale. The narration explains, "Step by step, parts of me I never imagined would see the light of day came forward. And they just kept coming." At the farthest right side of the page, Ripley looks over their shoulder at their past selves. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> The narration reads, "I finally spoke stood, and walked like... Me." as Ripley stands before a new signpost with an arrow pointing to the right. Small wildflowers and grasses bloom at their feet. Gaining momentum, Ripley takes off down the skinny descending path, joy breaking through them as they careen to the bottom and kneel at a stream. "Hello there, Me." the caption says as Ripley smiles at their reflection in the water, their fingers dipped into the stream with purple and yellow wildflowers blooming around them. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 5<br /> As they brush the dirt from their knees, Ripley's narrator asks, "So, what does trans joy really feel like?" Ripley shields their eyes as they look upwards, smiling, and the wind blows bits of petals and pollen around them. "Everyone's different, but for me... It's like a deep reath of cold mountin air. Full of light and love."<br /> Ripley looks out across the horizon with big trees and mountain silhouettes in the distance. "And like all adventures, you keep moving."<br /> We now see from Ripley's point of view, a trail stretching on into the distance with a signpost pointing towards the trees and mountains many miles away. The native grasses and flowers fill the air with their pollen and loose bits that are light enough to be caught in the breeze. "No destination."<br /> states the narrator. "No finish line. All joy."<br />

                                    <br /> PAGE 1<br /> Beside an illustration of an open laptop with a screen full of a yellow young man talking excitedly appears the text, "At the Age of 24, I got my first boyfriend." <br />
                                    <br /> Jewel, a pink cisgender woman, now stands in the shower, looking down at her bushy pubic hair while looking quizzical and slightly alarmed. Beside her, the caption reads, "And the full grown jungle between my legs became more of a dreaded issue in my mind."<br />
                                    <br /> Sitting nervously on the floor and sweating with anxiety, Jewel asks herself, "Don't men usually like their partners shaved? I'm afraid he won't be attracted to me because of my bush... I want everything to go perfectly when he visits, I don't want to disappoint him..."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> PAGE 2<br /> Squatting in the corner with her back to the reader, she furiously types into her phone, GOOGLE: Should you shave your pubic hair?" <br /> The results read, "Removing pubic hair may make a person more susceptible to common infections, UTIs, vaginitis, yeas infections..."<br /> "SERIOUSLY?!" exclaims Jewel, with the word "Ignorant" written next to her. <br /> "The question you're asking yourself is do you WANT to shave?" the search results ask her. <br /> As jewel walks away pondering her phone, the caption reads, "I started to research why some women shave to begin with."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> Page 3<br />
                                    <br /> In a park, Jewel comes across an orange woman and a pinky-rose woman who are having tea on the grass. They wave her over and Orange asks her, "We hear that you're pondering if shaving is for you?"<br /> "Yeah!" Jewel replies. "I'm worried about what my partner will think about my pubic hair..."<br /> Orange confidently tells her, "I for one can't stand my pubes getting in the way of my fun." and Pinky-Rose chimes in with, "I prefer to trim. It looks and feels tidier."<br /> "But what about UTIs?" panics Jewel. <br /> "Sure," Orange continues. "pubic hair can help against the, but shaving doesn't mean you'll GET UTIs! Follow these general rule of thumbs!"<br /> Pinky-Rose helpfully writes out the following advice:<br /> "1. Pee after sex<br /> 2. Clean with water after sex and avoid fragranced products<br /> 3. *Probiotic foods<br /> 4. Cranberry juice<br /> 5. Wipe front to back<br /> Etc.<br /> ** www.pushdoctor.co.uk/what-we-treat/sexual-health/urinary-tract-infection-uti/articles/urinary-tract-infections-foods-to-fight-the-bacteria<br /> Looking at herself and her full bush in the mirror, the narration next to her reads, "Time was quickly running out. After all my research and debating if I should shave, it dawned on me..."<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Jewel's reflection realizes, "I... like my bush."<br /> A big beautiful illustration shows Jewel posing with her pubic hair surrounded by flowers and the text, "It's like my best friend! Protecting my adorable little chooch. It makes me feel... well... Like a woman!"<br />
                                    <br /> The next panel returns to reality, with a fully clothed Jewel rushing up to meet her boyfriend at the airport, with the accompanying caption, "He's coming here for ME. And he'll get me; bush and all!"<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The caption continues, "I ought to shave if I want to, not out of pressure!" while the orange boyfriend and pink Jewel embrace for the first time. <br /> Later, in bed and in the act of becoming intimate with their underwears still on, Jewel nervously says, "Hey, uh... I've got a bush by the way. I hope-"<br /> "I have hair too!" Her boyfriend cuts her off. "All I care about is whatever makes you feel comfortable. <br /> At that, she flings away her unders as they begin smoochin' with lots of hearts floating around.<br />

                                <a href="javascript:toggle_expander('transcript-content');" class="transcript-title">↓ Transcript Of Today's Comic</a>
                                <div id="transcript-content">The comic opens in front of a Dungeons and Dragons back ally-style merchant shop. Atop it is a big, wide wooden banner proudly presenting 'Alanna's Shop'. Stood in front of it is a thin, robbed, green-eyed trans man elf.<br />
                                    <br /> With a curious look, he enters and the door rings.<br />
                                    <br /> At the counter, a larger, red, horned, Teifling, cis woman grins 'Well hello there, traveler!'<br />
                                    <br /> Her pose becomes a little more flirtatious, as she leans forward, pressing her cleavage forward in its loose blouse top, giving both us- you; the reader, me; the transcriber- and the elf a whole lot breast.<br /> 'How can I help you?'<br />
                                    <br /> We cut back to The Elf, lightly blushing as he looks away from the cleavage on display 'Ah, right, yes, you see...'<br /> 'Word has come to my ears that your prestige shop offers a variety of... special items. For special purposes...'<br /> His voice gets quiet and softer as his blush deepens, 'And I was wondering if I could take a look at-'<br />
                                    <br /> The panel looms over the others on the page, as the camera looks up from behind The Elf at the huge woman looming down at him. She's comes around the counter to address him directly.<br /> 'Ah, I see a client of discerning tastes...! Of course, let me show you the backroom~'<br /> 'Th-thank you you very much.' he stammers back.<br />
                                    <br /> We enter a dark room littered with toys of all kinds and shapes. Truly a smorgasbord of fantasy delights, drawn with much love and attention.<br />
                                    <br /> Alanna walks her customer through her wares.<br /> 'There you go! My selection of special items. Curated from the very best... for the very best!'<br /> 'Ah! Haha- you flatter. But I'm not sure I count as-'<br /> 'You're cute, I can't help it.' she interrupts as she leans over and whips her tail around him.<br />
                                    <br /> Stepping further into the den of delights, she continues on 'So, see anything you like?'<br /> 'Some of these...' he looks briefly away, 'I admit, I don't even know how they'd work.'<br /> Alanna's eye glints as she turns around 'Oh? Perhaps a demonstration is in order?'<br /> "!! Please!'<br />
                                    <br /> The panel shows our savvy business owner go in for the kill, as she lifts The Elf's chin up.<br /> 'Easy...' she coos, and leans in to whisper in his ear, 'These work best when you take your time.' He gasps.<br /> 'A little... setup.'<br />
                                    <br /> She slowly peels the jacket from The Elf.<br /> 'Excited?'<br /> 'Y-Yes!' he stammers.<br />
                                    <br /> The camera turns to see Alanna out of her skirt sporting a leather harness and a large purple dildo, it's ever so lightly adorned with some smooth gems, that we can assume give it some added magical properties. She drips lube and strokes it in front of The Elf who bashfully gulps in response.<br /> 'This, my pretty elf, is a classic strap-on. My Specialty!'<br /> 'Sh-show me...?'<br />
                                    <br /> Her red fingers reach forward and stoke a freshly exposed genitals surrounded by ginger pubes and an unbuttoned pair of slacks and shirt.<br /> 'Yes, yes!' responds The Elf. <br />
                                    <br /> Alanna pushes her partner backward toward a desk, looming over him as he slowly falls out of his clothes, 'Relax, I'll take it from here.'<br /> 'Hm!'<br /> With a lick across his neck, she penetrates him.<br /> 'Ah!!!' <br />
                                    <br /> As the scene plays out, we see a panel from behind The Elf as Alanna takes him by the hips.<br /> 'Comfortable?'<br /> 'Yes!!'<br /> 'Excelent!'<br /> Our camera whips behind the pair, and we see from behind Alanna as she picks up the pace. <br />
                                    <br /> 'Hng! Ah!!! M-More! FASTER' cries out The Elf, as Alanna seems to happily provide. The two fuck with abandon, and we get to see him embrace her, closeups of the penetration and all of the fun as they bump and grind. It's seriously lewd and hot, and amazing.<br />
                                    <br /> 'I'm close!! Don't stop! Don't sto-'<br /> DING DONG rings the front door. Both of our protagonists stare at each other unmoving. Not a breath passes...<br />
                                    <br /> 'Hello...?' sounds out from the first room.<br />
                                    <br /> Unphased, a quiet Alanna turns to eye the door to the other room 'Oh. I may have forgotten to close up the store...'<br /> The elf is red hot in apprehension as he sits there impaled on her dong. A real stag-in-the-headlights moment.<br />
                                    <br /> The camera moves back to the other room to a green orc, with red eyes and short tusks. A new Patron looking for wares.<br /> 'Are you perhaps in the back- OH.'<br />
                                    <br /> We see what the Orc see's as they split the curtain. In front of them is a merchant balls deep... strap-on-deep(?), Harness-deep(?) in an elf, propped up on a desk.<br /> 'Ha. Um... Interested in a demonstration?' Alanna responds.<br />
                                    <br /> And with that, the comic ends!<br />

To Ziggy and Matthew for your heartfelt support of this story, and thank you to everyone who said hi and checked in on me during the event!

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> A crowded scene with a speaker standing center stage, surrounded by people wearing leather fetish dog masks in the crowd. <br /> "WELCOME TO THE AUSTRALIAN PUPS AND HANDLERS COMPETITION 2023!" booms the speaker into their microphone. "Awooooo! Awooooo!" howls the crowd. <br />
                                    <br /> Hien is a cis man of Asian descent who wears big square glasses and has a short mustache and beard while almost bald on top. The hair growing along the sides of his head is pulled back into a small bun. Hien peeks through a curtain at the back of the audience, watching the speaker as they announce "It is wonderful to see so many of you celebrating the many ways to be a pup a handler, and a part of this community!" The audience continues to "Awoooo!" when a voice behind the curtain asks, "Hello?"<br />
                                    <br /> Back on the other side of the curtain, Hien swivels back to his place working the admission table to this pup event. <br /> Someone in a dog mask and chest harness with no shirt and yellow shorts asks, "I'd like to buy some raffle tickets?"<br /> "Absolutely." responds Hien. "Gibe me one second..."<br /> Another person without a mask but wearing a leather cap and vest with no shirt and leather pants asks, "Do I sign in here?"<br /> "Yes!" Hien replies, a little flustered. "My crew will be back in just a moment to get you checking in." While Hien is handling the festival goers, an average middle-age man and woman couple who are wearing regular street clothes starts to slip past him to go through the curtain. <br /> "I just want a peek." The woman insists as they continue to the curtain. <br /> "Excuse me!" Hien waves at them. "Sorry, this is a private event!" <br /> "Oh, okay." The woman acquiesces. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Text rolls over and obscures the next three panels that show hands gesturing and frantically entering information on a cellphone that continuously dings. <br /> "how much are the raffle tickets?"<br /> "We have $10, three for $25, seven for $50."<br /> "I'll grab $50."<br /> "Could I get your name and number here please?"<br /> "Hey! Can I just come in? You remember me right?"<br /> "Is the raffle for the whole lot of just one of these? And what's going on with the auction?"<br /> "Um..."<br />
                                    <br /> A person in leather gear hands confirms his purchase on Hien's phone and hands it back to him as Hien flusteres, "Um... I don't know... When I have a second, I can try to find someone who does... Sorry... I know so little, and took on so much..."<br /> A person with a mustache and earring, wearing a grey tank top, observes Hien's interaction. A shorter person wearing a full leather pup mask accompanies the mustache person. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> The mustache and pup mask couple approach Hien. The person with a mustache asks, "May I?" as they extend a hand towards Hien's belly, which is exposed in an unbuttoned collared shirt. Hien parts his shirt more as he says, "Oh! Sure."<br />
                                    <br /> The person tenderly touches Hien's tummy and then lovingly scratches it like a puppy's tummy, telling him, "Such a good boy. You're doing so well."<br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> In the background is a faded out series of panels of Hien talking with the couple, saying "I'm really trying my best, but... I feel like I'm always behind. I wanted to be the right person for this... I don't know--- [text obscured] -- I thought I would be better at being in charge--- [text obscured]"<br /> In the foreground over the panels, the couple and Hien stand together in a huddle, the mustache person resting his hand on Hien's back. The glow with blues, purples, pinks, and yellows in this intimate moment. <br />
                                    <br /> A voice says "It's okay, pup."<br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> The mustache'd person brushes his hand against Hien's as they and their companion leave, smiling at Hien encouragingly. <br />
                                    <br /> Taking a moment to himself, Hien removes his glasses to dab at his misty eye with his shirt corner. He replaces his glasses and then, with renewed determination and focus, he announces, "That's right! I am a good boy! and I've got this!"<br /> From the audience on the other side of the curtain "Awooo! Awooooooo!" fills the air. <br />
                                    <br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1:<br /> Color palette is grey, light orange, white, and black. <br /> A couple are getting out of their car at the entrance to a marked path in the woods. <br /> "Ah... My favorite tradition." says the red headed Runner, holding the car door in their hand.<br />
                                    <br /> The masculine Hunter has broad shoulders, a beard, and dark grey hair streaked with white that goes down to their shoulders, although it is partially pinned at the back of their head in a bun. The Runner is shorter with an athletic build accentuated with subtle curves. Their red hair is tied into a ponytail of two braids and they wear small white backpack.<br />
                                    <br /> "Everyone's out trick or treating..." says the runner as they stretch against a wooden fence. <br /> The Hunter holds their left foot in their hand while balancing on the other leg as he replies "...Just you, me, and the woods."<br />
                                    <br /> The Hunter playfully holds the runner from behind as he asks, "Think you'll get far this year?"<br /> "Hah!" snorts the runner. "Easily. I've seen your gym times. I get my *treat* either way, right?" <br />
                                    <br /> "Right." says the Hunter with a kiss on the back of the Runner's head. "Stick to the route. NO TRICKS!" The runner blushes and smiles in pleasure. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2:<br /> The mood changes to competitive and friendly-menacing as the Hunter growls into the ear of the Runner, "...Now *run*."<br />
                                    <br /> With wicked delight the Runner sprints away, looking over their shoulder at the Hunter with an expression daring them to catch them. The hunter winks at them while counting down the head start on their watch. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3:<br /> The runner sprints through the menacing woods, sweaty and panting, their perspiration steaming in the chill air. They are flushed and clearly enjoying this game of chase and hunt. At last the Hunter finds them! With giant smiles they give chase. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> "AIEEEEEE!!" We see the Runner's shorts and backpack cast to the ground.<br />
                                    <br /> Through the empty spaces between a craggy tree silhouette we see the Runner get scooped up by the Hunter, the Hunter biting into the Runner's neck and then their penis pushing between the Runner's vulva. The two go at it like animals, both fiercely enjoying themselves. <br />
                                    <br /> PAge 5<br /> Their fucking climaxes with an animalistic "Aah-HHH!!!" <br />
                                    <br /> They smile and laugh as they recover together, high on endorphins and dripping sweat. <br />
                                    <br /> As the Hunter takes a much-needed slug from the water bottle that was in the Runner's backpack, the Runner gets into a racing stance against a fallen log and devilishly demands "Rematch??", much to the Hunter's surprise. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br /> Page 1<br /> TITLE: The Collector by Emil Wilson<br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: I arranged a hook-up with this hot guy. We seemed compatible. <br /> Emil, a white man wearing glasses, looks at a picture of a smiling bald man on his phone.<br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: I arrived at this apartment and happily, he looked exactly like his online photos. <br /> The same bald man is smiling as he opens his apartment door and we can see many full shelves behind him. <br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: His apartment was crammed with stuff. At first I thought he was a hoarder but then I realized that he was a collector. Of many, many things. <br /> The bald man proudly points out his collections to Emil. The walls are completely lined with shelves that are full with similarly shaped objects. <br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: These collections included: thimbles, bobbleheads, dice.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 2<br /> Narrator: If this had been a romantic date, these collections would be a way to understand this guy better: who was he? What did he value? <br /> Emil looks at the smiling bald man. <br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: More Collections: Lego sculptures, Air Jordans, superman stuff.<br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: But with a hookup, there was no reason to be curious or judgmental. Our paths will probably never cross again. Besides, 40% of all people collect something. <br /> The Bald Man asks, "Do you want something to drink?" and Emil replies "Nah. Where's the bedroom?"<br />
                                    <br /> The bald man opens his bedroom door for Emil and gestures him inside.<br /> Narrator: During a hookup, you're invited into the most intimate area of a stranger's home. And that's where the collections can get more personal. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 3<br /> Narrator: Collections in the Guy's Bedroom: Disney figurines (But only the female villains), celebrity hair (several small bags pinned to a cork board)<br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: I contemplate what collection, if any, might be a dealbreaker for me, something so challenging that I might have to leave before things got physical. <br /> Emil regards the collections quizzically, with a finger to his lips. <br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: Hunting knives (no way!), Smelly, mold stuff (Do people really collect that?), MAGA stuff (he can believe any ideology he chooses but that doesn't mean I'll get naked with him)<br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: In his bedroom, he has shelves of Victorian dolls. Most are old and broken. Many of them have at least one eye missing. <br /> The Bald Man puts his hand on Emil's back as Emil looks at the shelves of Victorian dolls. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> Narrator: These dolls seem to be watching us. Even the ones without eyes. <br /> Illustrations of a mass of broken unnerving dolls. <br />
                                    <br /> The Bald Man begins kissing Emil's neck and snaking his arms around Emil's shoulders from behind, while telling him, "Relax". "Yeah, I know" Emil responds, looking frozen and unsettled. <br />
                                    <br /> Narrator: The look like demons.<br /> An illustration of a cracked, eye-less baby doll face.<br />
                                    <br /> More eye-less broken doll faces are shown with the text "Just close your eyes maybe those dolls were his grandmother's" floating over and around them.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Close up of a wonk-eyed baby doll face. <br /> Close-up of Emil's freaked out eyes.<br />
                                    <br /> The bald man asks "Do you want me to cover up the dolls?" and Emil responds, "Would you mind?"<br />
                                    <br /> A blanket covers the doll cabinet. <br />
                                    <br /> As Emil and the bald guy lean in to kiss, Emil says "It's a cool collection though."<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> Comic page with cartoony drawings by Ripley LaCross, using a color palette of warm tan and steel blues, with accent yellow colors. <br />
                                    <br /> Panel 1: A crowded music venue has a looong line waiting at the bathroom. The person at the front of the line is hunched over a little, holding their crotch, and looking slightly panicked towards the bathroom door. <br />
                                    <br /> Pee Person (PP): Shouldn't have chugged all that water before the first set... My bladder is gonna explode! <br />
                                    <br /> A patron finally exits the bathroom and PP shoves past them through the door exclaiming "Oh My-lanta, finally!" while the bathroom-exiter looks at them with irritation for rushing past them so close. <br />
                                    <br /> PP reacts in horror and disgust, thinking "Oh! Oh my god..." at the sight of a truly groady toilet, just, the fucking worst toilet situation you've ever seen- except you can't even see the worst of it, because the artist pixellated out the contents of the bowl of the toilet. <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2:<br /> PP slams the door closed and leans against it, sweating in horror, while saying "There's... no way... it's so gross!"<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley Lacross is next in line to enter the bathroom and comments to PP, "Sounds like big trouble in a little toilet". PP responds, "The biggest!"<br />
                                    <br /> Ripley opens their vest to reveal an assortment of funnel-like objects attached to the interior panel. Ripley gestures at them while looking over their shoulder, like they're sharing contraband.<br /> Ripley: No problem, I've got you. Check it:"<br /> PP (still sweating and vibrating from how much they need to pee): "What in the..."<br /> Ripley is now lounging inside an over-size pee funnel that's kind of shaped like a canoe. <br /> Ripley: This is the pStyle. A stand-to-pee (STP)* device that lets you pee standing up, or fully clothed! (*AKA a "Portable-Urinary-Device") This doo-dad opened up my world, Big Toilet™ owns me no more!<br /> PP: Okay, first of all, security let you in here with all those?? Secondly, how does that help me go number one?<br /> Ripley: Hold onto your britches, and I'll tell you.<br /> PP (looking like they're going to die from how badly they need to pee): I've been holding!<br />
                                    <br /> Page 3:<br /> A person who was standing in the crowd at the music venue is now standing alone in some kind of field . They undo their fly and wedge the pStyle between their legs and then pee while standing up. <br /> NARRATION: YOU JUST SLIP IT INTO YOUR UNDERWEAR (OR PUSH THEM TO THE SIDE) AND HOLD IT UST BEHIND YOUR URT<br /> You just slip it into your underwear (or push them to the side) and hold it just behind your urethra. (Press up against your body for a good seal.) ...aim... and go weeee~!<br />
                                    <br /> The person gets back in the driver's side of their car, their moody teen (who was also at the music venue) is listening to music on their headphones. The person deposits their pStyle into a bag while smiling contentedly. <br /> NARRATION: When you're spent, simply wipe forward with the beveled back edge (like a spatula!) Give it a shake, bag it, and you're ready to rock! (Don't forget to wash it when you get home)<br />
                                    <br /> Now we return to the bathroom line with Ripley explaining to PP, who eyes Ripley's pStyle nervously, "It's no bigger than a banana, so it squeezes into my backpack just right. (Right next to my massive canteen the reason I pee so much!) It goes wherever I go!<br />
                                    <br /> Page 4:<br /> PP snatches the pStyle and lunges into the bathroom, exclaiming "I can't take it anymore! Gimmie!"<br /> Ripley cautions, "Careful in there! There's a wee learning curve!"<br /> In a flashback scene we see Ripley in the past struggling to use the pStyle while standing at the edge of a toilet. <br /> NARRATION: For me, it took a lot of willpower to overcome the 'I'm peeing my pants' sensation and open the floodgates. Then sometimes I struggle to find the right angle. Like, my body hasn't changed! Why do I have to hold it differently today?? And don't get my started on splashback... So I practiced in the shower! Tilting me hips forward gives me better flow control. (And the position gives me those good Gender Feels, y'know?)<br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> Back to present day, with Ripley holding both vest panels open to show off all their different Stand-to-Pee devices that are strapped inside. <br /> Ripley: Out of all the STPs I've tried, the pStyle is the easiest to use, clean, and store. It's also the least-gendered STP I've found, neither feminine nor masculine. The sleek, non-gendered design and colors make it more like a cool accessory. Meaning you can pee in style. I mostly use it for hiking and the occasional seedy venue. Just having it in my backpack gives me peace of mind.<br /> PP returns from the bathroom looking greatly relieved, in fact they are surrounded by shining stars. They say, "One of these would have been SO handy at Melting Dude '19.<br />
                                    <br /> The music starts up again on the stage, prompting PP to say "Oh! Just in time, the next band is going on!" while the next person in line to use the bathroom opens the door to it and looks horrified. PP gestures at the line of people waiting and asks Ripley "But, uh, any chance you've got a few extras for our friends?"<br />

                                <div id="transcript-content">Page 1<br /> IMAGE: Close-up of Hien Pham's balding head in profile from the top to his nose, his black hair getting thicker the further down it grows on the back of his head.<br /> Narration: I like to think of my balding as my hair migrating to a better place. I don't blame them. They've been through a lot. Growing up, hair was a tool people used to exert control over my body.<br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: Silhouette of scissors hacking through hair<br /> TEXT: At school, boys with hair longer than acceptable were forced to cut it in the bathrooms as teachers guarded the door.<br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: Hien's face in provile, from nose to his shoulders.<br /> TEXT: You either stay in line or have a piece of yourself taken away.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Page 2:<br /> IMAGE: Hien's hands dab into a jar of beard oil and he spreads it across his hands.<br /> TEXT: Now that the hair on my head has fled to my chin, I make sure to take good care of it.<br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: Lots of jars and bottles for beard maintenance on Hien's counter, along with a brush and comb.<br /> TEXT: My beard feels light and fluffy when I oil it. The beard butter stays fresh and fruity all day. I use the balm to sculpt and frame my face. And wax on my mustache if I feel particularly mischievous. <br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: The bottom of Hien's face as he rubs the oil into his beard.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 3:<br /> IMAGE: Hien continues rubbing the oil into his beard with care.<br /> TEXT: But, I think, the most important things aren't the tools I have. Rather, it's the act of care itself. <br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: Hien's hand picks up the round beard brush.<br /> TEXT: Every time I brush my beard, I'm wrestling back a form of self-expression that was denied to my younger self. Every time I brush my beard, I tell him that...<br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: A younger, beardless version of Hien with a full head of hair appears in the mirror reflection, next to present-day Hien who is holding his beard brush. <br /> CURRENT HIEN (to younger version): You matter.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 4<br /> CURRENT HIEN: On your darkest days, you still wake up to a beard you get to grow. It's thin, and it doesn't show up on the photos all that well... But it's yours.<br /> IMAGE: Current Hien passes the beard brush to Younger Hien.<br />
                                    <br /> CURRENT HIEN: You find so many ways to care for it, and through caring for it, you care for yourself , too. No one has the power to tell you that your body is unacceptable. Not anymore.<br /> IMAGE: Current Hien tosses more and more hair supplies to Younger Hien, who tries to catch them all.<br />
                                    <br /> CURRENT HIEN: You matter.<br /> IMAGE: Younger Hien's arms are full of tools and he looks naive and bewildered.<br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: Current Hien grasps Younger Hien's shoulder.<br /> CURRENT HIEN: The way they look at you won't matter.<br />
                                    <br /> Page 5<br /> IMAGE: Current Hien combs his beard, washes his hands, and leaves the bathroom.<br /> TEXT: On cool days, my beard catches the wind. It pulls on my chin a little and anchors me in a body that keeps going. <br />
                                    <br /> IMAGE: Hien looks out into a brilliant sunset.<br /> TEXT: And as it keeps going, I do, too. <br />

                            <strong>Patreon’s Snaffu Update</strong>
                            <br /> A few of you have reached out for more information about the Financial Patreon Blip (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644404/patreon-payment-declined-subscriber-flagged-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/patreon-is-fixing-canceled-payments-and-inaccessible-funds-for-creators-175319787.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engadget</a> &amp; <a href="https://status.patreon.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon’s Status page</a>) we suffered this past month and a half, curious to know how bad it was in the end. It took a while to really figure out what the impact was beyond <em>supporters just disappearing</em>, but right now it looks like we lost about 10% of our monthly revenue. Where that leaves us is a real question! This next month or so I’ll start exploring fresh fundraising and see if we can’t stabilize things a bit. Let’s just see how it goes. </p>

It was a pretty small event but way more work than either of us expected, but I couldn’t be happier with the end result. Other big news is I’ll be stepping away from doing monthly comics on here for a little while [&amp;#8230;]</summary>

                        <strong>Other big news</strong> is I’ll be stepping away from doing monthly comics on here for a little while as I got offered a really cool contract for a video game! I can’t talk about who it’s for or what it is yet but I’ll be back with one-off comics at some point after I learn the ropes with this new gig. Thank you so much for all your support in having me on as a semi-permanent guest artist for two whole years! A big thank you for Matthew and Erika offering me the role, it was a dream come true to work so closely with people I’ve looked up to for 10 years! And of course, thanks to Ziggy for helping edit my comics, and Hien for being such a great co-worker. Ahhhh, but I’m sure I’ll be back!<p />

                                <strong>Note from Matthew!</strong> What a wonderfull way to have a send off here on OJST! A huge congrats to both of you, Jey and Michelle. I’m so glad you found one another. </p>
                            <p>Heck, it’s sad to see Jey leave OJST – I wish we could hold onto all out artists indefinitely. But it’s super lovely to know Jey’s going onward and stronger than ever into their next project and as they mentioned; we don’t imagine this’ll be their last OJST comic. A huge thank you for sharing yourself and your amazing work with us all these years Jey. You’re amazing, and I can’t wait to be here for you when you come back with an idea or two =) </p>
                            <p>More to come on who’ve we’ve invited to fill in the monthly slot once Erika and I get over some jetlag from our own family-wedding; my sister got married – it was amazing. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Patreon news Stuff</strong>
                                <br /> The last few weeks I’ve been reporting all about the Patreon payment-snaffoo here in the bottom of the posts (TLDR; there was a payment-card-decline-issue, read about it on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644404/patreon-payment-declined-subscriber-flagged-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/patreon-is-fixing-canceled-payments-and-inaccessible-funds-for-creators-175319787.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engadget</a> &amp; <a href="https://status.patreon.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon’s Status page</a> – it really looked like we lost a serious chunk of our funding/backers). Later this week I’ll be able to say better how it REALLY affected us, we’re keeping our fingers crossed! But in the mean time, I wanted to say a thank you to all of you who went in and double check your pledges and those of you who renewed or backed us for the first time! It’s been such a stresfull little month, and each little Patreon email letting us know of your support – meant so so much to get. We love this project and want to see it go on, and it means the world to know you feel the same.</p>
                            <p>As ever, links to said Patreons. Come be a part of what we do here and help us fund these artists and comics. </p>

                            <strong>NEWS ON THE PATREON</strong> Last weekish we mentioned news about the Patreon goof-em-up (they made a mega payment-card-decline-issue on the site, read about it on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644404/patreon-payment-declined-subscriber-flagged-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/patreon-is-fixing-canceled-payments-and-inaccessible-funds-for-creators-175319787.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engadget</a> &amp; <a href="https://status.patreon.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon’s Status page</a>), and figured we’d loop you all in on how it’s going: so far it looks like OJST lost nearly 15% of it’s monthly income? But we’ll know for sure when next months payment lands. It’s tough not to be upset, about things that are so out of our collective control, so we’re trying to take it one day at a time…</p>
                        <p>Still, and I know we <em>always</em> ask… but if there was ever a time to come and support us with a buck or two, or even just double check your Patronage, now would be the time. We’d be deeply deeply thankful:</p>

                            </code>Giving it a quick look, I’m pretty sure the destined-for-the-states equivalent’s of this amazing preventative treatment, are <em>still </em>in FDA-testing-phase (if they’ve finally publicly released a vaccine for rUTI’s here in the states, please feel free to let us know!) In the mean time I love knowing what’s on the horizon, and how a simple vaccine can have such a positive impact on Robin’s physical and mental health. </p>

These comics are lovingly prepared, sourced fresh with all the right spices. Each hot-out-of-the-oven comic literally takes months and months of work! Tipping with just a buck or two each week keeps us going and the good food coming. </p>

                        <p>You wouldn’t believe the time and effort that went into this week’s comic! Sickness, travel, life, and then all the hoops and headaches I put Hien through. If you find yourself enjoying the comic this week as much as I do, I really encourage you to go let him know or, better yet, sign up to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/wavingpeople" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>! Nothing says <em>‘Awesome work’</em> like a buck or two.</p>

                        <p>Finally, as ever, I’m here in the bottom of the post asking for your support and help on Patreon to keep our site afloat and commissioning these kinds of unique comics! Twitter’s <em>explodin’</em>, late stage capitalism is <em>a-crumblin’</em>, and all the while this little sex-positive comic keeps on trucking. Help us survive by staying connected through a platform where you can directly support these sorts of comics <em>and </em>be a part of something good. </p>

When we reach out to artists, we makes sure to say we’re after comics on any kind of intimacy, and that our comics don’t have to be NSFW, heck, we even take comics on hand holding! So today’s SFW comic is exactly that; short sweet and good for the soul. Find Noël and let her know she’s rad, then heck maybe even buy a <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/badcatsstore/shop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sticker or two</a> while your at it.</p>

                        <p>I’m so thrilled to share with you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lefttorightstudios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Morgan Kagesheongai’s</a> comic on the complex intersection of hair, gender, and culture as a Two-Spirit Ojibwe! Being Anishinaabe myself, seeing this rad Woodland art style on our site is such a DREAM! The expressiveness of the lines infuses full panels with feelings in ways I don’t often find in other art.</p>
                        <p>While the little Two-Spirit here is trying to reconcile their gender expression and their cultural and spiritual expression regarding their hair, the dilemma they face is something many people experience in other contexts: What do you do when two ways you want to represent yourself conflict? Who do you turn to for answers? Can there even be a “right” answer? Learning to sit more comfortably in this in-between space of consideration is a good exercise for us all. Thank you so much, Morgan, for providing such great representation! </p>

                        <p>Let’s take a look at Demisexuality with <a href="https://twitter.com/ScribbleToons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scribble Toon’s</a> sweet slice-of-life anthropomorphic comic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Demi </em>is a branch on the Ace bough of the sexualities tree, and honestly every demisexual person will have a slightly different explanation for what it means to them. Our language is constantly changing and growing when it comes to finding words to express your sexual identity. Give it a google! If you see a bit of yourself in today’s comic, hold on to it. If it didn’t completely match up with your experience, then no worries! Throw yourself into researching this word online: it can be so incredibly validating to find a label and even a community that works for you. </p>
                        <p>I hope you enjoy seeing this slice-of-life comic. It feels so very <s>human</s> anthro, and I love it.<br /> A huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/ScribbleToons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scribble Toons</a> for this week’s comic!</p>

                            <strong>I hope this week’s sweet comic, inspires you! And if so, I have the perfect recipe:</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>1 –</strong> Peek at our <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/review-comic/harnesses-packing/">harness reviews!</a> We still love our <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/jaguar/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jaguar Harness</a>, but a more current go-to tried-and-true is the<a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/bend-over-beginner-kit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Bend Over Beginner Kit by Tantus (reviewed by Jey!)</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>2 –</strong>
                            <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/review-comic/dildos/">Explore some dongs </a>(if you’re new to this go small and smooth). I personally recommend the <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/velvet/">Fuze Velvet</a>, BUT the <a href="https://www.early2bed.com/?ref=ojst" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early to Bed Team</a> had a whole arsenal of favs they <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/best-of-2022/">recently recommended</a>!</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>3 –</strong> And while you’re at it <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/review-comic/lubes/">find a good lube</a>, too!</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>4 –</strong> THEN read up on <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/pegging-by-kazimir-lee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kaz’s classic pegging comic</a> and maybe even <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/how-dildos-saved-my-rear-zachary-clarkson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zach’s How Dildos Saved My Rear</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>5 –</strong>Top it all off with <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/anal-sex-preparation/">Anal Sex Preparation</a> and the <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/buttsex/">Butt Sex Comic!</a>
                        </p>

                        <br /> A big thank you, as ever, to <a href="https://twitter.com/jeypawlik" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jey</a> for sharing such a lovely snippet of relatable autobio. I think there’s something deeply important to be reminded that, as much as our media and culture seems to portray otherwise, our sex drives aren’t meant to be going at 100% all the time. It’s a wave that’s always in flux and there’s no ‘wrong’ or ‘right’ amount. If you want to learn more I’d recommend reading an <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/come-as-you-are-2/">older Erika comic about a book we absolutely adore: <i>Come As You Are.</i>

                        <br /> Today is our first update <em>after</em> the <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/pledgedrive2023/">Pledge Drive Month</a>! We wanted to say a <strong>huge thank you</strong> to the hundreds of you who signed up and took part. It was such a boon to the team and me to see so many of you join up with a fresh donation and commitment. Heck even just the tweets of support and kindness were amazing to see. Thank you.<p />
                        <p>We’re planning on making a post all about how it went when we actually get real numbers- Patreon is crazily complicated when you’re a per-post-account, it’s almost impossible to tell how the fundraising affected our income until a month or two after! Wild right? Regardless, the sign-ups we saw were so deeply encouraging – truly thank you all.</p>
                        <p>If you are new here or are only JUST hearing about it; We did a fundraising <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/pledgedrive2023/">Pledge Drive last month</a> to help keep this site going! If you want to be a part of that, check these hand links out! The rewards are still there for you!</p>

                            <a href="https://twitter.com/wavingpeople/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hien Pham</a> went out and <strong>learned the ropes</strong> with today’s personal review of <a href="https://www.theduchy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Duchy</a>!<em> “One of the oldest and friendliest places on the web to learn about rope bondage.”</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>There’s some stuff that <a href="https://twitter.com/wavingpeople/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hien</a> just didn’t have room enough to go into! This <strong>massive</strong> Rope-bondage and Shibari tutorial library is a scrappy-small-run business (just like us!), there is a bunch of free content but when you start to explore you’ll realize you need a <em>membership for the good-shit</em>. There is a scale here, but our recommendation; <strong>sign up for that $5-9 per-month range</strong> as a good starting place and it’ll get you all of the members-only tutorials. Then when you’re ready for even more – <strong>the $10-19 gets you pretty much the whole site</strong> (Behind-the-scenes content and seeing how the sausage is made, is always my fav!)</p>

The process of coming out is complicated and different for everyone, but there’s an exquisite joy to finally being in a place where you are able to get to know yourself, accept yourself, and share yourself with the world! </p>
                        <p>The harder people make that for us, the more important and life-saving these stories of resilience, acceptance, and support become. I’m deeply grateful to <a href="https://mollyskyfire.carrd.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Molly</a> for sharing hers with us, and I hope you find it as moving as I do! </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Let’s learn how to clean your collections today! Have you ever wondered the best way to clean each type of toy? Never fear because with these handy recipe cards you’ll always be able to come back and check the basics. Always remember to wash your toys before and after using them, be sure to read the cleaning instructions for each piece you purchase, and use condoms on toys if you’re sharing!</p>
                        <p>I didn’t get to touch on specific toy cleaning products due to space and if I’m being completely honest I don’t think are worth it. As long as you use a mild unscented soap on your toys, then that’ll be more than enough to get them safely clean to use internally. I just wouldn’t recommend spending your money on it.<br />

                            <strong>April 23 – TALC VS CORNSTARCH Note from Matt</strong>
                            <br /> This comic has a bit of advice on the Latex care section to originally cover your latex clothes in cornstarch to store ’em! We’ve since changed this to include Talcum-powder/Talc. But honestly, it seems like both have their contentious issues?! Talc is in the news for being carcinogenic, while Cornstarch is in studies as having properties that bind it to latex, and can promote mold over time in humid environments! We’re not completely sure what piece of advice to point you toward and strongly recommend you do more research! </p>

                        <p>During our anniversary month we have lined up <b>three bonus comics</b> and <b>video interviews</b> with members and artists of the OJST Team that will <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy">
                                <i>only</i> be available to patrons</a>. We’ve got comics from Hien Pham, Jey Pawlik, and Erika Moen (hi, that’s me!), as well as video interviews conducted by indie comics sweetheart (and former guest artist) Lucy Bellwood with all of the above, plus former guest artist Danielle Corsetto and the devastatingly handsome OJST co-founder Matthew Nolan. Plus you get the <i>nine years</i> worth of locked Patreon content that already exist. </p>
                        <p>Can’t contribute financially? <strong>You can still help OJST stay afloat by sharing this post or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OhJoySexToy">our Patreon</a>.</strong> Years ago our reach on social media was stifled by the sex-phobic algorithms not only because of the nature of our content but also because we’ve got the word “SEX” literally in our title (Not a business-savvy move on our part, to be fair), and our account is also unsearchable on Patreon, too, because we’re marked as “Adult content”. We can’t reach the people who signed up to our accounts, but <em>you</em> can reach <em>your</em> followers for us!</p>

                        <br /> Gosh, I adore any kind of toy-combo-meal-deal that includes multiple toys and sizes <em>all in one</em>. Thank you, <a href="https://www.tantusinc.com/products/bend-over-beginner-kit?rfsn=118059.e6112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tantus</a> and Jey!<p />
                        <p>I <em>was</em> going to link to a few specific stores, but it looks like <em>most </em>of the stores we work with have this kit handy, so I linked to them all! That being said, I’d love it if you used our <a href="https://www.early2bed.com/tantus-bend-over-beginner-kit.html/?ref=ojst">Early to Bed link</a> or <a href="https://www.tantusinc.com/products/bend-over-beginner-kit?rfsn=118059.e6112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tantus link first</a> and foremost.</p>
                        <p>If you’re looking for other toy recommendations, check out our <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/best-of-2022/">recent Best of 2022 comic!</a>

You might remember her work from a year or so ago with this <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/perfect-weather-lena-let/">beautiful camping comic</a>. I feel really honored they came back and made us another one, and heck it’s so flipping good and fun. </p>
                        <p>Go tell Lena she’s wonderful! Even if she’s not able to reply to them atm, I know she’d appreciate the good vibes:</p>

My friendships have also benefited from doing this, but I’d never try it with my own family for… reasons.</p>

                        <p>Today’s comic hit’s me so <em>directly</em>. I don’t often share much of myself here- <em>I know right?</em> That sounds like a contradiction, since this is OJST and I’ve reviewed hundreds of butt toys for you all! But it’s true, even when talking about how some things have felt <em>in </em>my body, I’ve always taken deep steps to be <em>personally</em> private. Today’s comic goes straight to my deepest failing. I struggle so much with anxiety, living in the future, and entertaining the <em>what-ifs</em> instead of being present. It’s a lifelong struggle, especially during such a turbulent time for us here behind the scenes.</p>
                        <p>Hien and his comic is like a splash of cold water and I’m so ever thankful for it.<br />

                                <strong>Note from Hien –</strong> Thank you to Matthew, Ziggy, and Erika for their herculean effort to put this comic together with me! Your patience and persistence are wholeheartedly appreciated! And, of course, thank you to my good friend Garrett for his generous love and kindness, and for giving me the moment that inspired this comic. Big hugs and many beard scratches next time I see ya, puppy!</p>

                        <p>Ha, yeeeeah, I really put Hien through the wringer on this one! <em>So many drafts,</em> so many tweaks! Hien’s ambitions and ideas dashed against my frustrating editorial cliffside. Hein will be sharing those behind the scene moments with us <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the Patreon this week!</a> So if you want to see just how many hours went into this amazing comic and the hundreds of amazing bits that got left on the chopping table, <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">consider signing up to check it out-</a> it’s only a dollar per OJST comic and really helps keep this site afloat and commissioning more comics like this one from our artists. </p>
                        <p>—</p>
                        <p>ALSO, some of you eagle-eyed viewers might notice that today’s comic is displayed a bit differently!</p>
                        <p>We’re taking new steps to make the future comics and select comics from the archives more social media shareable. We’re now chopping up the comics into <em>pages</em> while still displaying them here as if they’re still one tall image through CSS alchemy. You can check it out by right clicking on the comic in different places and opening the image as a new tab. It took me all weekend to figure out a good process for it. BUT, going forward, you can expect us to <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/split_page_format/">update older comics</a> into the new format and we’ll start posting the Erika-Matt* ones onto socials for all to see: we’re a soon-to-be 10-year-old site and it would be great to get more of our content out there to an audience who didn’t grow up with ’em! </p>
                        <p>The next step: I gotta find a Reddit expert 0_o<br /> *I’ll need to ask guest artists for permission if we aim to post their comics onto socials (since they own their work), but I gotta leave something to do for next weekend ;D Information about our complicated <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/license/">license stuff can be found here.</a>

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A hard but sweet comic about dysphoria today, by Willow Payne. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for more on gender dysphoria, we&amp;#8217;ve slowly been working on the search engine, tags, and links of the site (thank you editor-Ziggy!). Heck we&amp;#8217;ve just added in a new Gender Category for you to check out. Huge thank you to Willow [&amp;#8230;]</summary>

One that’s actually pretty revealing to Erika and mine’s life; she’s often talked about seeing colors and shapes after having a good time, and it’s not something I’ve ever really been able to understand!? Like… sure… sex is fun, but no, hon, I didn’t <em>see </em>fireworks and rainbows as it happened. Welp, turns out – it’s a friggin superpower. </p>
                        <p>Rachel is always a delight to work with and today’s comic just sings. A while back she also made us a comic about <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/healing-after-birth-trauma-rachel-semenov/">Healing After Childbirth</a> that I really recommend reading!</p>

                            <br /> 2022 was a challenging year for us here at <em>Oh Joy Sex Toy</em>. With Erika moving on to new projects we’ve been expanding the team and hiring more artists to keep everything running- new costs that are worth it, but add up quickly! </p>
                        <p>So it’s with deep thanks and celebration that I’m writing about a long time friend of the site <a href="https://daviddlevine.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David D. Levine</a>, who we are incredibly fortunate to be financially bolstered and supported by this year. He is helping us pay our dozens of guest artists to produce their sex-positive comics and our team to keep everything running behind the scenes. Thank you so much for your kindness and support, David! We couldn’t do this without you.</p>
                        <p>Not everyone can support us like that (although if you <i>can</i>, <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/ojst-Business/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">please do reach out!</a>), but you can still help out by pledging just a dollar or two per comic <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over on our Patreon!</a>

                        <p>This wouldn’t have been possible without their generous help! I’m going to attach the buy buttons to <em>all our affiliated stores</em> so you can shop where you like, BUT it would mean the world if you’d started your search at <a href="https://www.early2bed.com/?ref=ojst" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

                            <br /> 2022 was a challenging year for us here at <em>Oh Joy Sex Toy</em>. With Erika moving on to new projects we’ve been expanding the team and hiring more artists to keep everything running- new costs that are worth it, but add up quickly! </p>
                        <p>So it’s with deep thanks and celebration that I’m writing about a long time friend of the site <a href="https://daviddlevine.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David D. Levine</a>, who we are incredibly fortunate to be financially bolstered and supported by this year. He is helping us pay our dozens of guest artists to produce their sex-positive comics and our team to keep everything running behind the scenes. Thank you so much for your kindness and support, David! We couldn’t do this without you.</p>
                        <p>Not everyone can support us like that (although if you <i>can</i>, <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/ojst-Business/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">please do reach out!</a>), but you can still help out by pledging just a dollar or two per comic <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over on our Patreon!</a>

                                <strong>A note from Jey:</strong> Hey y’all Jey here to tell you how I use the Magic Wand to destress! Times can be tough and sometimes I’m just not up for the whole kit and caboodle so I’ll just reach for my old trusty favourite instead.</p>
                            <p>This last year has been a lot with getting sick, having sudden wrist pain, social media being what it is, it really bummed me out. I’m thankful for my partner Michelle and my therapist, so things are looking up but I know it can be rough sometimes. So this is just a little something I do to relieve some of that pent up energy.</p>

                        <p>Take a breath and let Hien take you by the hand while he explains to you what sex, sexuality, and labels he’s explored along the way and what they mean to him now. At the very least it’s a beautiful reminder that we all never stop growing and changing, and that when it comes to sexuality there are no wrong or right answers. </p>

                                <strong>A note from Hien:</strong>Thank you to everyone who’s helped me explore sexuality and discover more of what it means to me – especially those who held my hands through the awkward stages! And thank you to every ace-spec person out there who has ever found comfort and solidarity in my stories. Every time I get to hear from you, my heart gets all warm and fuzzy. I hope you’re all doing okay and taking it easy when you can. Enjoy the rest of the year!</p>

This past year has been absolutely wild for us, with so many shifts and changes, and we’re eternally grateful to still be here, making sex-positive comics (with your <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amazing help</a>) Deeply thanksful and touched. </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Small news</strong>; <a href="https://ohjoysextoy.com/the-team">Ziggy’s</a> been busy making our OJST search engine better! It’s still a deep WIP (who knew search functions could be so complex), but now the site ought to be a little smarter when you look for comics, keywords and tags. We’d love it if you give it ago. Sometime soon we’ll write up some behind the scenes info about it all, and alot of the thinking that’s gone into it all. </p>

                        <p>It’s something I’ve always struggled with and still do from time to time but once I realised I could change some of the things that caused me the most pain, it did get more bearable. As a nonbinary person who’s not planning on going on hormones, it can be tough to engage in society, I’m glad there are some other options I can lean towards to make my body feel more like my own. Maybe I’ll even see about tattoos in the future!</p>

                        <p>If you’ve ever tried stepping foot into the world of creative art and study, you’ve probably experienced young Jey’s story firsthand. It’s a deeply freeing and explorative moment for a lot of artists. A place where you (gradually) learn to leave preconceptions at the door and are actively invited to study the human body for your own betterment. It can be a really important moment of reflection and growth – and heck – I’m deeply thankful Jey felt like they could share theirs with us! Thank you, bud – you’re amazing and this comic rules. </p>

                        <p>Stay tuned to Erika’s socials this week (<a href="https://twitter.com/erikamoen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fuckyeaherikamoen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!), as she gets ready to announce her <strong>new monthly Patreon</strong> (don’t worry we’ll be keeping the OJST one). After one whole year of stepping away from OJST, this new Patreon will be <strong>a space JUST for her </strong>and all her many projects (comics: heck yes)! It’s a really big moment for us!</p>
                        <p>And if it’s not too cheeky, it would mean the world to Erika and me if you consider supporting it when it drops (and heck, <em>continue</em> to support us with <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon">a buck or two on OJST too</a> ;D )!<br /> We truly couldn’t do OJST and explore her mental health book without you all. </p>
                        <p>Hope you all had a lovely Halloween and stay warm for the upcoming winter.</p>

                        <p>Start of next month, Erika is going to announce her new Patreon (don’t worry we’ll be keeping the OJST one!), for just her and her work! It’s a really scary time for us (thematically in keeping with the holidays, I suppose ;D) as a lot of OJST’s income will be up in the air. If you enjoy what we do and want to see us continue to hire artists like Alina each and every week and give them all a safe space to explore sex-positive comics, please <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon">consider supporting us with a buck or two.</a> This very second it really would make such a difference!</p>

                        <p>Gotta <em>hand</em> it to Hien, this comic is a <em>fistful </em>of feeling and emotion! It’s technically NSFW, but only sort-of-kind-of? I mean, you never actually see any naughty bits! …And yet. This one is about so much more, it’s a real… <em>handful</em>. (you think that’s bad just you wait…)</p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Hand to my heart</em>, this isn’t something I’ve ever tried or <em>poked</em> around myself, so it’s a real delight to have Hien <em>open up</em> and share his adventure. He’s really <em>widened</em> my perspective. I feel <em>full</em>… of knowledge ;D</p>

                                <strong>A note from Hien:</strong>A very special THANK YOU to my good friend Jaxx without whom this comic wouldn’t be possible! All of us here in Perth are so proud of you for putting yourself out there and winning the Australian Puppy 2022 competition! Can’t wait to see what you do with the title, buddy. Big hugs!</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Heck yes =D let’s put our<em> hands together </em> for both Hien and Jaxx, thank you, guys!</p>

                            <br /> As much as I joke though; a little reminder that fisting, in general, is, like, level 100 and should be done with a wholllle lot of care and practiced with experts and plenty of research. You gotta go SO slow and be oh-so delicate! So if today’s comic inspires you to try it (and who’d blame you!) please do make sure to do plenty more research and study up before<em>hand</em>. Today’s comic isn’t a how-to!</p>
                        <p>ALSO, some of you regular readers might recognize the look and vibe of today’s comic from a few weeks back!<a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/out-loud-hien-pham/"> When Hien gave us a wonderful comic about taking up space and learning to be loud.</a> Just so happens today’s comic happened MINUTES before that one – so one might say… they go… <em>hand-in-hand ;D</em>

                            <br /> It looks like the <a href="https://www.sheboptheshop.com/vixen-creations-gee-whizzard.html#partner=OJST" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gee Whizzard</a> can be a hard-to-find item! That happens with Vixen Creations; they’re a small team who makes small but high-quality runs for their toys! I found <a href="https://www.sheboptheshop.com/vixen-creations-gee-whizzard.html#partner=OJST" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shebop</a> and <a href="https://www.comeasyouare.com/products/vixen-creations-gee-whizzard?aff=ohjoysextoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Come As You Are (CA)</a> have the Gee Whizzard in stock. But, would recommend shopping around if they’re sold out – there’s are also a few similar variants out there like the <a href="http://affiliate.thepleasurechest.com/98620/7783/url_24652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                                <strong>‘Gee Whiz’</strong>
                            </a> so just search for ‘Vixen’ when you’re on the hunt and see what you can find.</p>
                        <p>And heck, if you want <em>more of our reviews</em> of what is STILL Erika and mines fav silicone-toy-makers, <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/tag/vixen-creations/">Vixen Creations, read our hot-takes here!</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally; here are some links to Erika’s reviews of the amazing <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/hitachi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Wand (2013)</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/magic-wand-rechargeable/">Magic Wand Rechargeable (2015)</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/magic-wand-plus-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Wand Plus (2019)</a>! All three are amazing toys that we still use, love dearly, and are made to fit the Gee-Whizzard.</p>

                            <br /> Today’s comic reminded me of this gem of a comic by <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/dragon-age-molly-ostertag/">Molly Ostertag on Dragon Age</a> that we got back in 2015, dang, how time flies!</p>
                        <p>I’m trying to scratch my brain to see if there are any dating games I truly connected with recently that I can recommend here in the footer… But I’m coming up slim. Sureeee, my heart felt pangs for residents in Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, but was it romantic for me?… I’m not sure, not really. I think for me, I’ve always enjoyed a more voyeuristic POV; <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/sims-4-wicked-whims-mod/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sims games with the limits removed</a> or, heck, even Rim World with a horny mod or two. Getting to create little characters and watch them fall in love? <em>Now we’re talking.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>What I’m trying to get at is that games are amazing and that there are a hundred different ways to explore relationships and that–</p>
                        <p>–OH WAIT! <em>I remember now </em>– The last time I felt <em>pangs </em>for characters in a 1-to-1 dialogue game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scarlett Hollow</a> by our very own <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/bdsm/">Abby Howard</a> and Tony Howard-Arias! Legit spent FAR too much of my time romancing Stella and later Oscar, and not enough time solving the game ;D Very much recommended if you like your romance with a big dash of <em>SPOOKY.</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>An incredible autobio comic on breasts, sensation, mastectomies, and surgery. </p>
                        <p>a href=”https://www.instagram.com/shainley/” target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”&gt;Susannah Hainley‘s comic on her mastectomy and implants really surprised me! One of the personal benefits about working on Oh Joy Sex Toy is the regular exposure to brand new topics and treatments that would never have occurred to me on my own and today’s story is the perfect example. That diagram of a quartered breast, displaying how the tissue, implant, and nerves all fit together? <i>Wow.</i> Not only was it super illuminating but also a genuinely beautiful illustration to boot.</p>
                        <p>There’s always so much more to learn and Susannah’s surgeon actually has a page further explaining <a href="https://annepeledmd.com/sensation-preserving-mastectomies." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensation Preserving Mastectomies</a>, explaining what they are and how they are performed.</p>

                        <p>In OJST news: After last week’s survey, Matt and I are pretty sure we will <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon">continue with the same billing system on the Patreon</a>, rather than switching it to a new method. We are both so grateful to everyone who took the time to participate in the survey and give us thoughtful feedback! We couldn’t have made an informed decision without our patrons weighing in. Thank you so much to those who participated! Patreon pays for all the comics posted here, and in exchange our patrons get exclusive content and bonus comics.</p>

                        <p>Work has been a bit wild over here the past few weeks, with Erika planning out her new Patreon (It’s now been one full year with Erika side-stepped away from the site, and we’re finally putting in the work to get her, her own Patreon again! Woop!) running into some health trubs, and my first Jury Duty on the horizon, it’s been none stop!</p>

                        <p>In a lot of the emails I send out to potential comic artists when recruiting for OJST, I always make a point of saying that our comics <em>don’t need to be NSFW</em> or pure science or autobio. “…heck we’d even want comics on hand holding; anything to do with relationships really!” – I’m glad somebody finally took me up on it =D I think today’s comic is an absolute delight, and I hope you do too!</p>

                            <strong>As an update:</strong>
                            <br /> The team and I have been drumming up thoughts this past few weeks!</p>
                        <p>– <strong>This month will officially be OJST’s first full year without Erika at the wheel!</strong> We’re thinking it might be a great time to finally split <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon">the Patreon into two</a> (one for her DBT mental health and autobio WIPS as she explores her book work) and the other for OJST as its own creature, with a <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/the-team/">team at the wheel</a> (basically nothing changing, but now you’ve had a year to see us at work!)</p>
                        <p>– <strong>Further afield in March/April 2023; OJST will officially be turning 10 years old.</strong> We’re thinking of running a pledge drive around then for the site’s financial health and adding a bunch of bonus content into the <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon">current $3 tier</a> (I think we’ll turn this into a fancy Pledge-drive-bonus Tier). I’m hoping to set up some interviews and pick up a few secret-bonus comics for it all. I listen to a bunch of things on the <a href="https://maximumfun.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maximum Fun network,</a> and I like how they handle the whole ‘one month a year – they plug a drive’, so I want to channel some of that energy! Heck, we’re <em>artist-owned, audience supported,</em> just like them, why can’t we make that work too!!!</p>
                        <p>– We’re ALSO thinking about the winter; when our Sponsorship will be up for grabs again. Gotta work on filling that out! <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/ojst-Business/">Do reach out if this is something that interests you!</a>

                            <strong>“Prostate play doesn’t feel as heavenly to me as people always talk about…”</strong> Oh gosh – such samsies! It’s so easy to fall in love with the prostate-dream; there’s so much anal porn out there that makes it seem AMAZING. But I guess we’re not all built the same and that reality can be a bit of a <em>bum</em>mer. Some of these things take practice and finding the right toy and moment to ‘click’. That being said, I don’t think I’ve ever run into a We-Vibe toy I dislike; so the Vector might be a solid bet!<br />

                        <p>Surely you remember Matt’s and my first two reviews of the previous seasons? Don’t worry, you can catch up on our <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/omgyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Season 1 review</a>
                            <i>(Spoilers: we loved it)</i> and <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/omgyes-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Season 2 review</a>
                            <i>(DOUBLE Spoilers: we loved it even more)</i>. I know singing the praises of your sponsor might look kinda suspect, but honestly Matt and I fucking love what OMGYES is doing and how they do it, and we sang their praises in that first review long before we had any professional connection to them. It’s just a genuinely good resource provided by folks who <em>also</em> help keep our site afloat and free of obnoxious ads, so… <em>Win-Win</em>.</p>

                        <p>My best fucking friend, my most favorite person on earth, go <a href="https://twitter.com/plustenstrength" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send him a birthday message</a> and tell him what an amazing job he’s been doing running OJST single-handedly for almost an entire year now. I keep thinking I couldn’t be prouder of and more impressed by him and then he amazes me anew on the regular. Happy birthday today, honey. I can’t wait to finally show you the gifts I’ve been hiding around the house for <i>months</i> now!!!!</p>

                            <p>This one is dedicated to everyone who hugged and kissed and kept me company during VicBear’s Southern Hibearnation 2022. Thank you for teaching me that it’s ok to want to be loved, and that it’s ok to ask for it. Thank you, too, to my dear friend Lauren without whom the trip wouldn’t be possible! Thank you all, again, from the vers and top and bottom of my bear heart.</p>

Those unkind moments where you compare yourself to others and decide you’re somehow lacking.

We met through an online roleplaying group and found out we only lived around an hour away from each other so we hung out a lot. Sometimes you just click and want to kiss. I didn’t even know I was gay back then.</p>
                        <p>The rp we had going was a slow burn fantasy journey which mirrored our own growing relationship a little too well. I used roleplaying as JP as trying out being gay in a really safe way and I’m so thankful for these characters Michelle and I played together. We ended up rehashing them into our webcomic Dead City <a href="https://topazcomics.com/deadcity/welcome/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">(which is completed now if you want to check that out)</a>!</p>

                        <p>It pertains to the human experience and our relationships with those around us; something that feels deeply important, and heck, I’m so thankful Hien felt like he could share it here!</p>

                            <p>From Hien:<br /> This comic is dedicated to hugs, affectionate touch, and the friends who helped pull me out of the spiraling dark abyss by giving me love. I’m so lucky and I’m so grateful to have y’all in my life. <a href="https://bearsperth.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shoutout to my Bears Perth!</a>

                        <p>A huge thank you today too, for <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Patreons who help keep this site going</a>, and enable me to hire and showcase as many artists as I can, <em>and </em>keep Erika working on her DBT book. I know Erika’s still on her long sabbatical (for health and DBT-book-project reasons), but without the continued support there<em> for these comics</em> our site and her work just wouldn’t be possible. These past few years have been tough for all of us, but without that support, OJST just simply wouldn’t be running. And, well, I feel like I don’t say thank you enough: so, thank you, guys. Truly.</p>
                        <p>On the same note; we’ve been brainstorming a bit about maybe further down the road doing some big pledge drive or sale to help build up some funds – I listen to a lot of podcasts while I edit comics for the site, and they all seem to do a yearly ‘pledge drive’? With OJST approaching its 10th year (<em>I KNOW RIGHT?</em>) that might be something good to try out? Some sort of ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5SO7cAyGRE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Save Our Bluths</a>‘ fundraiser? So maybe more to come on that when we get back from seeing family in June (My first time going back home in 3 years 0_o!)</p>

                            </code>That’s 3 sexy-porny comics in a row! Hot-damn! Sometimes it just happens like that; lots of artists want to make sexy short comics and then by coincidence all hand in at the same time! I hope you’ve all enjoyed the horny start to Spring ;D Next week, <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/category/comic/hienpham/">Hien’s back with another amazing personal comic.</a> I won’t spoil it for you, but this one will <em>make you feel things.</em> I can’t wait to post it!</p>
                        <p>Oh Joy Sex Toy is able to hire so many talented artists covering a wide variety of topics each week because of the patrons on Patreon! <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/patreon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Join us there to get more pictures, writing, and comics in exchange for your patronage</a>. Truly it means the world and we can’t make this site possible without the kindness you all show over there. </p>
                        <p>June’s coming up and so is a trip I have to make to go see family in England! While I’m away I’ll still be available to hit up for guest comic slots (we’re always <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/submissions/">looking for comic artists</a> to work with!) but might be a little slower to respond. That’ll be my first trip out of the states in a whillllle, which me luck! =D</p>

                            <em>A note: if you’re getting or have gotten top surgery make sure you wear sun screen with a SPF of 30 to 50 for the first year or two. Sun exposure can darken scars permanently, making them more noticeable. For the sake of this comic I did not include sunscreen but I was very diligent on wearing it.</em>

                            <br /> Gosh, it sure has been a while since we got a review up and done huh? Turns out, getting things to Australia is a toughie. A huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/wavingpeople/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hien Pham</a> for stepping up to the plate and taking on the <a href="http://affiliate.thepleasurechest.com/98620/7783/url_22065" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bVibe Triplet!</a> (And a mighty second thank you to the bVibe team!) Reviews are a whole other kind of comic, and opening up and talking honestly about your own masturbatory practices is really tough, both on a personal and artistic-comic level.</p>
                        <p>I’ve had tons of requests over the years to cover <a href="http://affiliate.thepleasurechest.com/98620/7783/url_22065" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vibrating anal beads</a> – and hadn’t really ever found a set that felt good to me. Really excited to have one for the site that we can finally get <em>behind!</em>

                        <p>Well it’s been a while and I thought it was about time I gave you all an update on where I’ve been and why!</p>
                        <p>After nearly a decade of working on OJST non-stop, I was feeling preeeeetty burnt out so I’ve been taking the last seven months to switch gears for my creativity and health. What does one do when they take a break from their long-running, deeply personal and frequently autobiographical comic series? One starts a <em>new</em> deeply personal, <em>entirely</em> autobiographical <em>graphic novel</em>, of course! </p>

I’m already past 70 rough pages! If you saw <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/magic-wand-plus-mental-health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some</a> of my earlier OJST <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/mental-health-practices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comics</a> that mentioned going through IOP and wondered <i>“What the heck even is that?”</i>, then <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/58918219" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

                        </p>
                        <p>Aside from comics, I’ve also been making lots of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fuckyeaherikamoen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cool shit</a> too, with the Good Posts about them going up (mostly publicly! For free!) <a href="https://www.patreon.com/erikamoen">on my Patreon</a>. Oh, and I just made an Instagram account to show off my extremely cool and not at all unnerving <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladylovelylockslibrary/">Lady Lovely Locks collection</a>, despite intense discouragement from multiple people who love and care about me. Could an unstable person make….<strong>THIS?</strong>

                        <center>I rest my case.</center>
                        <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to let you guys know I’m still alive and I am just so incredibly grateful for and impressed by all the hard work that Matt and the newly assembled <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/the-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OJST Team</a> have put into keeping this site running without my participation so that I have the time and energy to rest and work on my other projects for a bit. It’s been fascinating and heart-filling to see this place fill up with comics by other creators. Obviously, we’ve always <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/submissions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showcased the work of additional cartoonists</a>, but to see this site become more of a community-driven resource that shares an even wider variety of views and experiences, I dunno man, it just feels good. AND it’s making me inspired for my own OJST comics again??? I don’t wanna get anyone’s hopes up or anything, but there may be a comic or two from Matt and me again in the future. <p />
                        <p>This time away from the regular grind has been good for my brain and heart. It’s helping me see what I loved about this place and career in the first place. I feel so lucky to have produced all the OJST comics that I did and I’m proud of what this site has become and I’m so, so, so grateful I have the support to take some time to myself to recover. Thank you everyone for sticking around and all your support over the years. </p>

                            <a href="https://twitter.com/menthaam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Menthaam’s</a> lovely comic today is all about her own personal experiences and definitions of sexuality growing up while living in Russia. We very much want a wide variety of people’s personal stories here on OJST, from different countries and cultures and translated from other languages, like this one.</p>

                        <p>Hey! Erika here! You still remember me, right? …I drew all the pink comics on this site for the first, like, 8.5 years of its existence? Yeah, that was me! </p>
                        <p>Well it’s been a while and I thought it was about time I gave you all an update on where I’ve been and why!</p>
                        <p>After nearly a decade of working on OJST non-stop, I was feeling preeeeetty burnt out so I’ve been taking the last seven months to switch gears for my creativity and health. What does one do when they take a break from their long-running, deeply personal and frequently autobiographical comic series? One starts a <em>new</em> deeply personal, <em>entirely</em> autobiographical <em>graphic novel</em>, of course! </p>

I’m already past 70 rough pages! If you saw <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/magic-wand-plus-mental-health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some</a> of my earlier OJST <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/mental-health-practices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comics</a> that mentioned going through IOP and wondered <i>“What the heck even is that?”</i>, then <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/58918219" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

                        </p>
                        <p>Aside from comics, I’ve also been making lots of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fuckyeaherikamoen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cool shit</a> too, with the Good Posts about them going up (mostly publicly! For free!) <a href="https://www.patreon.com/erikamoen">on my Patreon</a>. Oh, and I just made an Instagram account to show off my extremely cool and not at all unnerving <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladylovelylockslibrary/">Lady Lovely Locks collection</a>, despite intense discouragement from multiple people who love and care about me. Could an unstable person make….<strong>THIS?</strong>

                        <center>I rest my case.</center>
                        <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to let you guys know I’m still alive and I am just so incredibly grateful for and impressed by all the hard work that Matt and the newly assembled <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/the-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OJST Team</a> have put into keeping this site running without my participation so that I have the time and energy to rest and work on my other projects for a bit. It’s been fascinating and heart-filling to see this place fill up with comics by other creators. Obviously, we’ve always <a href="https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/submissions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showcased the work of additional cartoonists</a>, but to see this site become more of a community-driven resource that shares an even wider variety of views and experiences, I dunno man, it just feels good. AND it’s making me inspired for my own OJST comics again??? I don’t wanna get anyone’s hopes up or anything, but there may be a comic or two from Matt and me again in the future. <p />
                        <p>This time away from the regular grind has been good for my brain and heart. It’s helping me see what I loved about this place and career in the first place. I feel so lucky to have produced all the OJST comics that I did and I’m proud of what this site has become and I’m so, so, so grateful I have the support to take some time to myself to recover. Thank you everyone for sticking around and all your support over the years. </p>

                        <p>I hope you all love it as much as we do and go tell <a href="https://twitter.com/csuggsillo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Christine</a> how fantastic they are!</p>
